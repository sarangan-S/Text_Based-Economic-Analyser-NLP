NDB Group CEO Dimantha Seneviratne in this interview reflects on the success of the bank’s recent Rights Issue for Rs. 8 billion but succeeded in raising Rs. 9.5 billion, as well as the way forward







NDB Group CEO Dimantha Seneviratne




Q: You recently concluded a successful Rights Issue, why did you go for a Rights issue during a pandemic? 
NDB is one of the most efficiently capitalised banks in the country. Despite the exponential growth the bank has produced, it also
generated sufficient return on capital to ensure that the bank’s capital adequacy levels are met. Hence the returns the bank produced on shareholders’ equity, reflected in its return on market value of equity at 27.3% prior to the Rights issues, was the highest among its peer banks. But this low level of capitalisation was not sufficient to meet the planned rate of asset growth of the Bank, hence the requirement for the capital infusion.
The Rights Issue was actually announced in October 2020 after the second wave. However in the mean time we were hit by the third wave, notwithstanding which the rights issue was a tremendous success. The timing was of a concern more from the convenience of the shareholders to participate than apprehension of shareholders not wanting to participate. We are very pleased by the confidence the investor community has in NDB and our growth plan. Despite the pandemic, the bank is confident of it will not fail the investors faith in delivering on their expectations,
 
Q: NDB Rights issue was announced for Rs. 8 billion but the bank raised 9.5 billion; how?
While the bank was planning the Rights Issue, we looked at cornerstone investors to come in knowing very well our growth plans. Norfund indicated their interest in taking up 10% of the issued share capital of the bank. Hence the bank entered into agreements with Norfund with appropriate market announcements to take up any unsubscribed shares there by reducing the level of dilution for the existing shareholders and any shortfall will be met by way of a Private Placement. 
With the existing shareholders taking up over 83% of the rights, in order to accommodate the entire requirement of Norfund, the bank had to issue Private Placement shares at a 10% premium to the rights price for about 5% of their requirement. Hence around Rs. 1.7 billion of Private Placement shares was issued taking the total to Rs. 9.5 billion. All in all a good outcome in challenging times.
 
Q: Why were the Private Placement shares issued at a higher price that the Rights Price?
 This was mainly to protect the interests of the existing shareholders as the private placement wold lead to a dilution of their stake. You will note that the Rights Price was arrived at based on a 10% discount on the then prevailing market price. The Private Placement was priced at a premium of 10% to the Rights Price. Hence the Private Placement was at the then prevailing market prices to ensure that Norfund does not get an advantage over the existing shareholders.
 
Q: With the Rights Issue behind you, what are the plans to use it?
The bank has drawn up a five-year plan till 2025 to steer its course. We plan to increase our penetration in key economic sectors to support the growth of the country, whilst ensuring that the portfolio is not overly concentrated on one sector. We also note the new sectors opening up, such as organic fertiliser manufacturing, boat building, techno cities, etc.
Development Banking is in our DNA, hence we intend to support financial inclusivity for women, the MSME sectors and budding entrepreneurs, particularly exporters of the country. Once the effects of the pandemic recede, the bank will be ready to forge ahead aggressively with its plans. Meanwhile, the bank will work towards supporting our clients to navigate the third wave and emerge with a sustainable business model.
 
Q: You have been championing technology adaptation, how does this fit in with your plans?
The current situation we are in now as a country cannot more strikingly exemplify the need to adopt more technology as a country. We have lagged behind long enough, now it’s forced upon us.
NDB has long-planned its technological platform, to ensure that the changing requirements can be met with agility and are scalable. Our growth will be underpinned by improving efficiency internally. This will be by means of adopting technology to carry out mundane and time consuming activities. Currently the bank has over 15 robots (RPAs) at work enabling it to increase the throughput without increasing head count. This efficiency is reflected in one of the best Cost to Income ratios in the industry.
We will continue to invest in technology to improve processes internally, while passing on this benefit to the customers as well. For example, we recently introduced Robo Calling to customers who have insufficient funds in their account to meet inward clearing cheques. While helping save staff time at a time like this, it gives customers time to fund the account.
Our push towards financial inclusivity is also technology driven, to ensure that while the bank is efficiently reaching its clients, it is also encouraging the clients to bank efficiently. One of the key initiatives here is the ERP solutions the bank is offering its MSME customers. This will enable the client to maintain their books in an orderly fashion and also share that information with the bank seamlessly. It becomes easy for the bank to make credit decisions; in fact this may lead to made automatic preapproved facilities as well.
Combining the power of workflows, RPAs and data, the bank will start offering tailor-made solutions meeting the clients’ lifestyle and financial choices. Since this will be across the NDB group, the clients will be able to seamlessly operate their banking accounts, manage their stocks and investments with NDB Securities and NDB Wealth. This will be via the NEOS App, one app for all your financial needs.
 
Q: What value addition is expected from Norfund?
The Nordic countries are quite advanced when it comes to technology adoption, supporting entrepreneurship, remote working, renewable energy, etc. We expect Norfund to bring on board the necessary expertise that the bank needs in these areas from a governance and leadership stand point. Also Norfund can give access to technical assistance for the bank to learn from the experience of Norway and help improve the bank’s management capability in these areas. Long-term funding is another area in which we expect Norfund to support the economy of the country.
 
Q: What is your expectation of the impact of the third wave on the economy?
 This is a very critical juncture for the economy. The impact of the third wave is going to be worse than that of the first two due to the rate at which the virus is spreading, which might force the authorities to extend travel restrictions. This will impact the MSMEs and daily wage earners. The social impact could be wide-ranging. Further, we cannot afford the export industries to flounder; any travel restrictions should make special exceptions for these industries, airports and ports. We will have to continue to impose restrictions on imports to ease the pressure on the currency for some period and gradually loosen these controls.
The impact would also depend on how we manage the spread via lockdowns, etc., whilst allowing key sectors of economy to perform. Of course we have to extend some kind of moratoriums to distressed customers and support them at this critical juncture. I think if we act swiftly and collectively, with the immunisation program coming in, we can manage this situation soon and look forward to an economic revival soon.

Solution offers added convenience for PickMe driver partners through real-time connectivity


Standard Chartered Sri Lanka yesterday announced the enhancement of its robust payment capabilities with the implementation of the country’s first ever interbank instant payment API (Application Programming Interface) connectivity solution. 
The interface was executed for the seamless payments of PickMe, a brand of Digital Mobility Solutions Lanka Ltd.
The solution consists of routing real-time fund transfers to all banks connected to the Common Electronic Fund Transfer (CEFT) clearing system, which will allow funds to be credited to the driver partners’ accounts instantaneously, regardless of who they bank with. This application interfaced solution empowers driver partners to go beyond traditional banking hours, allowing the collection of funds to their respective bank accounts on a 24/7 basis, which are then ready for withdrawal through the closest ATM.
Commenting on the API solution, Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Head of Transaction Banking Roger Norton, said: “At Standard Chartered, we believe that innovative banking solutions are best proven when our clients are able to leap forward in their strategic business plans. Our API-driven solution provides PickMe with a transaction platform that goes beyond the boundaries imposed by traditional banking services, encouraging the inclusion of more driver partners into the financial ecosystem. We are proud to have been able to make this breakthrough with PickMe, one of the largest and most sophisticated companies in Sri Lanka.”
As a result of this implementation, PickMe’s driver partners can now initiate payment requests at any time instantly with a single click through the ride-share company’s mobile application. The API solution also sends real-time payment updates directly to the company’s in-built payment tracking tool, allowing for complete integration throughout the payment creation and fulfilment process. 
“Our driver partners are an absolute critical part of PickMe’s operations and we’re grateful to Standard Chartered for creating a long-term solution that caters to their financial needs, especially given the current economic situation. In addition to our existing driver partners being able to obtain their account receivables in real-time, thanks to the availability of the CEFT transfer mechanism, our potential driver partners can also easily come on board with PickMe, Sri Lanka’s number one ride-sharing application, regardless of who they bank with,” said PickMe Chief Financial Officer Shifaz Riyaz.
Requiring zero manual intervention from the company, this API solution merges the efficiency of routing payment requests directly through the PickMe application with the real-time transaction processing of the LankaPay instant payment mechanism (CEFT). 
Commenting on the bank’s real-time seamless connectivity solution for PickMe, Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Head of Transaction Banking Implementation Devaka Wijedoru, said: “We’re delighted to be able to offer this real value addition to PickMe and their loyal driver partners. By giving PickMe the real-time connection for information flow, we are able to empower drivers to manage their own payments with a single click through the app, bridging a crucial gap in service. We would like to invite other forward-thinking organisations to also take advantage of our innovative solutions and enhance their digital business operations that will not only benefit their clients, but the local community as a whole.”

Knowing well that Sri Lanka is a debt-ridden country and presently the repayment capacity is not sound, with no way of repaying the said loan without new borrowings, one would wonder what made the Bangladesh Central Bank opt for this loan even deviating from its own Internal Treasury Investment Guideline as the borrowing country does not comply with the standard rating requirement
 

Four days ago (28 May) I read a news item that appeared in the Daily FT of which the heading was ‘Bangladesh became a lender for first time thanks to SL’. This news item took me to my banking career of 1970/80s, which reminded me of the credit norms that we were practicing in the bank, as credit officers when a customer requested for a credit facility or a loan. 
On receipt of the loan application, we evaluated the financial healthiness of the borrower to ensure whether the borrower possessed a sound repayment capacity. Then we weighed up the borrowing records through various sources available, to ensure whether he was a defaulted borrower and was he in a position to financially breathe well irrespective of unaffordable debt burden. 
If response for those two were positive, then we sought for any security which in case to be used to recover the loan if the loan was not repaid as expected due to the reasons beyond the control of the borrower.
If the repayment capacity is not sound or if it proved that the borrower was not in a position to repay the loan, irrespective of the security he offered we refused to grant the loan. In case the repayment capacity was sound but his past borrowing records were not satisfactory or he was reported as a defaulted borrower, we directly refused to grant the loan unless he proved satisfactory arrangements that he had made with those creditors to repay those defaulted loans. Security was not considered as vital to grant the loan if those factors mentioned above were not satisfactory. 
When the bank refused a loan based on the above norms, the borrower has a propensity to look for the assistance of ‘Private Money Lenders’ (PML) at an exorbitant interest rate. When the borrower is unable to repay the loan with a normal rate of interest, how he pays at an exorbitant rate was not a matter to PML since such lenders used unethical ways to recover the loan. 
As reported in the above news item, Bangladesh grants this loan of $ 200 million to our country from its foreign reserves and this is the first time that Bangladesh is going to make such an investment in a country through a currency swap deal. I do hope the lender Bangladesh should have definitely evaluated the repayment capacity of the borrower that is Sri Lanka and its past and present borrowing records. In order to assess the repayment capacity, the lender would have used the global ratings. 
S&P a world’s rating agency has cut Sri Lanka’s long-term foreign currency credit rating to ‘CCC+ from B-’ for 2020, which exposed the risk of default. Another global rating agency Moody also downgraded Sri Lanka’s credit ratings to ‘Caa1 from B2’ in September last year. No doubt this fragile situation of Sri Lanka would have now significantly weakened, as consequence to the present rapid outbreak of COVID-19. 
Further it is reported that Bangladesh is going to grant this loan deviating its Internal Treasury Investment Guidelines since the borrower does not comply with the standard rating requirements. 
As I stated above, if the borrower does not possess a sound repayment capacity and the borrower’s past and present borrowing records are very bad, no lender will choose such a borrower to grant a loan involving an intolerable high risk. Knowing well that Sri Lanka is a debt-ridden country and presently the repayment capacity is not sound, with no way of repaying the said loan without new borrowings, one would wonder what made the Bangladesh Central Bank (BCB) opt for this loan even deviating from its own Internal Treasury Investment Guideline as the borrowing country does not comply with the standard rating requirement.
Has Sri Lanka offered any valuable security to moderate the high risk? As reported, the agreed security was ‘to exchange our currency with Bangladesh Bank equivalent to the amount of dollars they will be given and the Guarantee of SL Government’. It seems the borrower’s guarantee has been taken as security to secure a high-risk loan granted to the same borrower violating their own (BCB) guidelines.
However, it appears one plus point for the lender (BCB). That was the high rate of interest applied. 
The BCB will grant this facility at 2% interest, which is higher than other current global rates. However, charging a comparatively higher rate of interest will pose another issue. A borrower who shows a poor repayment capacity to pay a loan with a lower rate of interest (market rate), how can he pay such a loan when the interest was increased?  
As reported this facility will be for one year during which the fund will be provided. After getting the fund, Sri Lanka will have to repay it by three months. Does the BCB anticipate that Sri Lanka would be in a position to re-pay this within three months from the date of grant?
The history of Sri Lanka is intertwined with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent. The historical period begins roughly in the 3rd century, based on Pali chronicles like the Mahawansa, Deepawansa, and the Choolavansa. The first Sri Lankan ruler of the Anuradhapura Kingdom was Pandukabhaya is recorded for the 4th century BCE.
From the 16th century, some coastal areas of the country were also controlled by the Portuguese, Dutch and British.
The ancient Romans called Sri Lanka ‘Taprobane,’ while Arab sailors knew it as ‘Serendib.’ Then we have been named as ‘Ceylon’ and then Sri Lanka.
Independence was finally gifted in 1948 but the country remained a dominion of the British Empire until 1972. In 1972 Sri Lanka assumed the status of a Republic. A Constitution was introduced in 1978 which made the Executive President, the head of state. 
Such a country with such proud history is today looking for financial assistance from the country, Bangladesh. 
The borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the separation of Bengal and India in August 1947. Proclamation of Bangladeshi independence in March 1971 led to the nine-month-long Bangladesh Liberation War that culminated with East Pakistan emerging as the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. After independence, Bangladesh also endured famine, natural disasters and widespread poverty, as well as political turmoil and military coups. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative calm and rapid economic progress. 
Within such a short period Bangladesh courageously came to the present position to grant a credit facility of $ 200 million to a country which had the proudest history and abundant natural resources. Who brought Bangladesh to this emerging situation? No one else other than the inspirational leaders who loved the country while ruling the country during a very short period of five decades. We had a period that foreign leaders who visited our country have been inspired and wanted to be like us. But where are we today? 
Most of the people in our country view this borrowing, as a nature sarcasm caused due to robbing the State funds by those who ruled the country since independence.
The expectation was not to underestimate the emerging Bangladesh but to highlight the weaknesses of our past and present leaders who were not matured and didn’t have required revolutionary strength and visionary forward look to lead our beautiful country despite all the resources gifted by nature. It is not only one leader or one party that ruled this country who is responsible. But all those who ruled or rather ruined the country since independence is responsible for this heartbreaking situation. With greatest reluctance we have to accept without any iota of doubt, all those who ruled this country are individually and collectively responsible. We pray for a better Sri Lanka although no visionary leaders are at least to be imagined.

CEO Shamindra Marcelline




Sri Lanka’s pioneering state-owned financial institution, People’s Leasing & Finance PLC (PLC), will be celebrating its 25th anniversary today (31 May). 
The Chairman, CEO and staff members in a statement extended their sincere gratitude to the loyal clientele and stakeholders for unwavering loyalty and trust placed in the organisation over the past 25 years which has served to position it as one of the most trusted, sought-after Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) in the country.
Since its inception in 1996, PLC has branched out to every part of the country with an impressive network of 112 branches by 2021 to make inclusive finance accessible to all. PLC employs 2,400 persons across different roles and responsibilities which is a progressive expansion from its original team of only three members.
From Rs. 10 million capital in 1996, the group has expanded its capital base to Rs. 30.25 billion as at today. PLC has the most comprehensive and diverse portfolio of customised products and services among finance companies in Sri Lanka today offering Auto Loans, Gold Loans, Business Loans, Education loans, Housing Loans and Personal Loans at competitive interest rates. 
PLC currently has five subsidiaries and is synonymous with friendly service and flexibility which serve to set it apart from competition.
Commenting on the milestone, Chairman Sujeewa Rajapakse said: “People’s Leasing’s long-term goal is to become a sustainable and an admired business model that pioneers in inclusive finance. The uncertainties of the operating environment necessitate focus on improving the management of non-financial risks including operational and compliance practices as this is a fast-evolving aspect of risk management. People’s Leasing hopes to collaborate with industry peers and regulators to promote purposeful lending principles in the Non-Bank Finance landscape to support sustainable economic activity.”
CEO Shamindra Marcelline extended his sincere gratitude to the entire staff, past and present for their dedication and commitment that have served to elevate the organisation to its current standing: “I am thankful to each and every member of my team for working together to uphold the organisational philosophy of customer-centricity at all times.”
Marcelline further commenting on future plans for PLC said that PLC intends to forge ahead by creating a purposeful business that drives responsible stakeholder value creation: “We strive for a more integrated view on our business performance offering more impactful solutions to empower our customers through inclusive financial solutions with best-in-class customer service. We aspire to establish PLC to be a model for Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in the financial sector. With the strength of state-owned People’s Bank and the private sector vibrancy, there is absolutely no reason why we cannot be.” 
“PLC will digitise for convenience and efficiency because we believe technology can make our services more inclusive, accessible while improving operational efficiency and accuracy. The transformation has already begun and I am hoping the shift will fully materialise within the next 18 months. I hope, then, our stakeholders, the financial sector, the Central Bank and our ultimate owner the Ministry of Finance will hold up PLC as a benchmark for state sector enterprise transformation adapting to the ‘new normal’ compelled by the global pandemic,” Marcelline noted.  In conjunction with the anniversary, several activities have been lined up for the year including unveiling of PLC Tower, issuance of an Anniversary Stamp, Staff Recognition Awards, launching of a Co-Branded Credit Card, introduction of new products and services primarily catering to the female population and the launch of the state-of-the-art digital app to deliver a revolutionary user experience. 
The anniversary celebrations will also coincide with year-round CSR initiatives including presentation of critically required medical and non-medical supplies to improve COVID patient treatment and care at government hospitals with the resurgence of the COVID -19 pandemic. Introduction of renewable energy to power business operations, recognition of responsible business practices and impactful integration of green practices towards a lower carbon footprint will be prioritised companywide.

The team of DirectPay
 
 

DirectPay having commenced operations in 2018, has today gained the position of being one of the fastest-growing fintech startups to watch. 
It recently surpassed Rs. 3 billion worth of transactions that was achieved within a period of just two years.
Founded by Kanishka Weeramunda, Dinesh Karunathilaka and Sasindu Pathiranage the company was launched with the aim of transforming the financial landscape in the country for business, society and the government through the advent of offering cashless payments. 
Their solution offered an electronic payment option that provided a viable alternative to cash, where users could scan a QR code, enter their card details or use any of their bank accounts to make a payment. This was deployed through a mobile-based payment app, an Internet payment gateway or a payment link to receive remote payments, subscription payments where there’s a recurring revenue or it could be a bill settlement, all of which ensured a seamless journey to customers or service providers, covering the entire payment ecosystem. 
Since introducing their solutions to the market, DirectPay has forged high-profile partnerships with leading financial institutions, that included Cargills Bank for Visa and Mastercard, Nations Trust Bank to facilitate Amex, Discover and Diners Club payments and LankaClear to deploy the JustPay technology, to name a few. The successful implementation of each of these projects, eventually led to DirectPay being a leading private fintech operator selected to manage QR based payment initiatives to Central Bank and some of the foremost banking and financial institutions in the county. 
Speaking of the successes reaped, Kanishka Weeramunda said, “We are happy to say that our pace of growth has been exponential and with the unwavering market demand and the widespread appetite for our solutions among consumers and business alike, we expect to further enhance and grow our offerings over the next one year. With the challenging market situation currently faced, it is important to improve and re-imagine financial solutions and keep up to the pace of change required, and we are proud to have done this successfully, which has led to the business growth we have experienced.”
Dinesh Karunathilaka, outlining the market opportunities they envisaged explained, “From inception, we saw the advantages in how Sri Lanka can benefit from digitalising the payments process. For instance, anyone with a smartphone can make transactions including cross-border payments and purchases easily and efficiently. Digital currencies controlled by a central bank could avoid exchange rate risk and currency volatility if they are based on a range of currencies. Understanding these benefits led us to look at how we could serve the different verticals of cashless payments and incorporate them into our solution.”
DirectPay CFO Maduranga Ginigaddara added that the team had also put in place a solid business plan to help forecast and manage finances, which in turn lead to a profitable and sustainable business.
Sasindu Pathiranage outlining their future plans stated, “For the payments industry, COVID-19 and its consequences has provided the impetus to overcome consumer inertia to create an unprecedented global appetite for changes to how we pay, thereby disrupting the way money is transferred and how payments are made. Going forward, in a post-pandemic world, digital payments will become increasingly popular and widely used. People won’t care about where they bank but care more about how the transactions are being processed. Given these factors, we will be concentrating on three key priorities which would be security, cutting edge technology and transactional based lending for individuals as well as transactional based trade credit for merchants.”
Chief Marketing Officer Mariya Kaed added that the company will also focus on exploring new opportunities through an innovative growth hacking model that will be based on a data-driven, experiment-based process to ensure in their target audiences being able to make the best use of their future brand offerings. 
With innovate and efficient operating models in place and targeted market plans, DirectPay looks well set to be a leader in championing the cashless payment industry in Sri Lanka.

PARIS (AFP): France and Germany pushed for a “historic” agreement among major economies on a minimum tax rate for multinational corporations on Wednesday, hoping to shore up support after sceptical European countries expressed opposition to the plan.
Spearheaded by US President Joe Biden, the proposal for a 15% minimum tax rate has hit turbulence after Ireland’s Finance Minister expressed “significant reservations” over it.
“The change of (US) administration offers a historic opportunity and we have to seize opportunities when they present themselves. It’s now. It’s now that we must act,” insisted French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire at a joint press conference ahead of the upcoming Franco-German Economic and Financial Council.
His German counterpart Olaf Scholz said he was “optimistic” about the chances of sealing an agreement he said would end “disastrous fiscal competition” between countries.
“We are very close to concluding an international agreement” which will lead to “a revolution in international corporate taxation,” Scholz added.
Biden’s administration last week called for agreement on a unified tax rate of a minimum of 15% in negotiations with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the G20; but on Tuesday, Ireland’s Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said the country had “a really significant concern” about a global rate that meant “only certain countries, and certain-size economies can benefit from that base”.
The objection carries weight because Ireland hosts an outsized number of technology and pharmaceutical firms that were attracted to the country for its lower tax rate.
Last month, Dublin’s Finance Ministry released a projection saying it could lose two billion euros ($ 2.4 billion) each year in revenue starting in 2025 if a global minimum tax rate is enacted.
Donohoe’s concerns were echoed by Hungary’s Foreign Minister on a trip to Dublin on Tuesday.
“Like Ireland, Hungary is in favour of a low level of tax,” Peter Szijjarto said.
Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5% and Hungary’s is 9%, whereas France and Germany impose rates of almost 30%, according to OECD calculations.
Luxembourg, also home to myriad multinational companies, said it was in favour of “minimum taxation” in order to create “conditions for fair competition” between countries – but has not commented specifically on the proposed 15% rate.
Finance ministers from the G7 group of advanced nations – consisting of Germany, Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Japan and Britain – are set to meet next week in London, where they could endorse the US proposal.
Le Maire said he, Scholz and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak had agreed to do “their utmost” to draw up an agreement at the meeting.
They will then build upon on that at the larger G20 session in July in Venice, Le Maire said, adding that “step by step, we will manage to convince all of our partners”.
The IMF’s leader on Tuesday also offered her endorsement to the plan.
Finance chiefs have characterised a minimum tax as necessary to stem competition between countries over who can offer multinationals the lowest rate.
They say that “race to the bottom” saps revenues that could go to other government priorities.

I am pointing out the positives that will drive CSE to the next levels. I gave a prediction with 31 points in October ‘20 when ASPI was 6,000 that it will hit 10,000 by December 2021. By end-January it touched 9,000 and reversed due to the letter by CSE and is struggling slowly to get back there. It was a forced correction and nothing to do with fundamentals, in fact earnings have gone up tremendously and are really undervalued now. 

The following events dragged the market down:

February: CSE letter 
March: UNHRC resolution 
April: Delay in Port City Bill 
May: COVID third wave 


My 30 positive pointers for take-off: 
1. Interest rates very low AWPLR 5.65 Fixed deposits 5% 
2. Corporate Tax rates reduced. 28 to 14 – Construction, 28 to 24 – Banks, 28 to 18 – Manufacturing, 28 to 14 – Healthcare 
3. VAT rates reduced 15 to 8%. Also threshold increased. 
4. Amnesty on unofficial money – to be gazetted soon. 
5. Political stability with 2/3rd majority 
6. Local manufacturers supported by CESS, after import restrictions, lots of companies have expanded or gone for new investments. 
7. Market/business sentiments improved with above concessions. 
8. Rupee depreciation. Nov. 19 – 180, Jan. 21 b - 185 – 2.7%, May 21 - 198 - 7.0%. Overall 6.6% average for 1 1/2 years. It’s good for export, remittances and tourism but bad for imports, but less imports now. 
9. Business-friendly budget proposals for agriculture, livestock, pharmaceutical logistics, construction, manufacturing, IT, etc. 
10. Government projects in infrastructure-road works 100k km, water projects one trillion worth, housing, BIA expansion, highways, power, etc. 
11. Currently 289 ongoing projects each over 1 billion, totalling 5 trillion. 
12. Port City will be a game changer/take off for FDI and Investments – road shows to follow to attract investments. $ 5 billion in next 5 years and another 10 billion 5-10 years later. It will be an international financial centre. 
13. Mergers and acquisition on banks and finance companies and regional players targeting good companies through stock exchange. 
14. New Listings in CSE – 200 companies by 2025. 15 companies in pipeline for 2021 with tax concessions.
15. Partial Listing of SOEs through Selendiva Investments 
16. Dedicated minister in charge of capital market development. 
17. Demutualisation and new SEC act will be another game changer for CSE with a possible foreign exchange partnership and listing. 
18. New products to be introduced shortly to the market – REITS, Gold, Short selling and borrowing of shares, New Debt instruments and DVP. 
19. Digitalisation with all E services for Account opening, Payments, IPO, Rights, Dividend, CDS and AGM. Even during lockdown all areas can function smoothly. 
20. More new accounts opened, especially under 40s, education by CSE, seminars and school curriculum to promote share market opportunities. 
21. Social media awareness and enthusiasm among investors. 
22. Valuations. Currently we are trading at 10 PE (after new results announced) December ‘20 quarter was best ever with 85 b profits, March ‘21 results just coming in has already surpassed December results, we will easily exceed 100 b profits for the quarter, after providing for losses mainly from the tourism sector. If we achieve 350-400 b for a year at a PE of 15 our market cap should be 5-6 trillion; that’s almost double from now. Dividend yield of 2.5-3% means 85-100 billion is paid out from profit-making companies alone. While Singapore PE at 38, India at 31 and Malaysia at 27. At peak in 2011 we were at 29.5.
23. ASPI reached its peak in February 2011, was 7,800 then in January 2021 it broke and went to 9,000. Compared to 2011 and currently, ASPI 7,800-7,300 down 6.4%, Nifty 4,600-15,500 up 237%, Dow 12,000-34,500 up 187%. Most of the other markets also experienced similar growth. Above India and USA had the highest COVID numbers and currently market at record levels. We have not moved only backwards. 
24. Stock market cap to GDP we are at only 20% whereas USA at 200; According to Warren Buffet indicator less than 75 is really undervalued. Maybe our stock market is not properly reflected in the economy. 
25. Turnover has increased from 1.8 b in 2020 to 4.5 b in 2021, so far, we have surpassed 2020 t/o already. Market cap at 3.3 trillion. CDS accounts 700 k. 
26. Total fixed deposits in banks is around 10 trillion earning less than 5% now. Even if 10% is withdrawn and comes to CSE 1 trillion that’s quite a significant amount and more can come in the future. 
27. EPF fund is 3 trillion. In this low interest environment 30-40% can come to Equity. At least another 10% comes 300 b. 
28. Foreigners have been nett sellers even if you take the last 10 years 820 b buying against 897 b selling, Nett 77 b outflow for last 10 years (2020 and 2021 – 75 b outflow). 
29. Without EPF and foreigners we have increased turnover levels and had a reasonable rally, once both and more FD conversion to Equity comes in, we can enjoy a good rally and a more liquid market. 
30. COVID is only drag currently, that too with travel restrictions and vaccines to be given, hopefully will be brought under control. Most of the European countries and USA have controlled and vaccination given to more than 35%. Next Asia will follow with improvements. 

My targets with above facts:
1. Expect turnover per day 5-10 b by 2022 and 25 b by 2025. 
2. Further 1 m new accounts by 2025 (20% of 5 m employed private and public sector) 
3. Market cap 5-6 trillion by 2022 and 25 t by 2025. 
4. ASPI 10,000 by 31/12/21; 12,500 by 31/5/22; 15,000 by 31/12/22; 30,000 by 31/12/25

The long-standing relationship between SDB bank and Fiserv goes back to 2010, when the bank initially implemented transaction processing and branch teller functionality by leveraging the Signature platform from Fiserv, adopting a more contemporary and flexible account processing solution.

Battle to rise up amidst hostile global pandemic


With the unprecedented outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all the economies have been jeopardised in multifaceted means. As is the case in many countries, Sri Lanka has been impacted profoundly primarily in terms of economic and social infrastructure. 
Due to the island-wide lockdown situations prolonged in the country from time to time in year 2020, public transport activities were severely affected and also the aviation activities were disrupted in many instances due to the travel restrictions imposed to the foreign nationals and Sri Lankan expatriates. The ports sector was also affected by the disruptions to global logistics chains creating many repercussions to the supply chains across the world. 
Developments in economic and social infrastructure projects, activities pertaining to housing and urban development projects, including the Port City project, were impeded along with the lockdown. However, with lifting the island-wide lockdown in the month of May 2020, infrastructure development projects recommenced its operations and absolutely, new aspirations bloomed in an atmosphere of new normalcy. 
“Focusing on headline GDP, with the US and China engines humming, the world is set for a triumphant ‘V’ shape recovery. Beneath the surface, divergence between advanced and emerging markets, superstar firms and their smaller rivals, and high- and low-skill workers points to scars that will take longer to heal.” —Tom Orlik, chief economist, Bloomberg LP.
Yes, indeed. The waves of the pandemic have been striking across the world to-date rebounding every walk of life in the entire world. As a nation, we too are struggling to recover amidst many challenges and the financial sector in the country has a significant role to uplift the nation during this turbulent situation. 

Major economic activities yet keep moving on 
As depicted in the Annual Report published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) for year 2020, compared to the other sectors, the telecommunications sector showed a mixed performance during the first half of 2020. The telecommunications sector proactively engaged in introducing various digital platforms more importantly customised solutions which would be much beneficial to provide uninterrupted services to the public as well as internal operations of many organisations. Moreover, the Telecommunications and Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka has introduced several special packages to facilitate work from home (WFH) and study from home (SFH) arrangements. Moreover, the TRCSL took steps to implement the Gamata Sanniwedanaya project to provide access to the public who deprive the service in very remote areas in the country. 
If we discuss on the energy consumption, it is notable that a reduction in demand for electricity could be witnessed and total electricity generation has also been reduced correspondent to the previous year followed by the demand factor. However, no one would anticipate this hazard for many more ages and the projects we initiated which have been recommenced. As such the Broadlands hydropower project, with a capacity of 35 MW, is expected to be connected to the national grid by January 2021. 
As stated in the Annual Report of the CBSL, road development and rehabilitation activities continued at a slower pace during the first half of 2020. The Road Development Authority (RDA) incurred a substantial expenditure during the first half of 2020 for the maintenance, development of expressways and highways, widening and improvement of roads, construction of bridges and flyovers, and the rehabilitation of roads affected by natural disasters. Also, RDA has been carrying out construction of activities pertaining to the expressway network and the extension of the Southern Expressway Project from Matara to Hambantota, including an expressway link to Mattala, continued during the first half of 2020. 
If we move to the road passenger transportation, a sharp decline could be visible due to the travel restrictions imposed in island-wide lockdown. However, the National Transport Commission (NTC) continued to undertake initiatives to enhance the provision and coverage of road passenger transportation and several bus services were launched. Sisu Seriya, Gami Seriya and Nisi Seriya are underway.
Civil aviation was another much-hindered sector due to intermittent passenger and aircraft movements during the year. However, the progress of development projects undertaken by the Government to improve the airport and aviation sector in the country was adversely affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 during the first half of 2020. The construction of the second terminal (T2) project of BIA Katunayake, is underway. 
As it is learnt through the annual report 2020 of the CBSL, in relation to Port Services, container and cargo activities have shown a significant growth in third quarter of year 2020 correspondent to the first and second quarters which was much setback due to sporadic lockdown situations in the country. The Sri Lanka Port Authority was in the process of developing the East Container Terminal (ECT) and the West Container Terminal (WCT) in line with a five-year plan that is expected to be fully operationalised by 2025. 
The most vigorous health sector has adopted many strategies to curb the COVID-19 pandemic while engaging proactively and well-coordinating in collaboration with the Tri-forces and other stakeholders to-date. With the surge of the pandemic, health authorities have taken every possible action to facilitate patients and uplift the health lifestyle with Non Communicable Diseases with more and more intensive care unit beds across the country. 
In a nutshell, our effort is to emphasise that based on the Government’s revived fiscal policies each prominent sector which contributed to the development of the country with the financial sector led by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka toiling in sleepless nights during the trying times with the objective of building up a prosperous future to our next generation.  

The bottom-line of the successful story and Bank of Ceylon’s dramatic role 
Being a responsible corporate citizen and the country’s No. 1 Bank in Sri Lanka with the pledge to commit as Bankers to the Nation, as history validated, Bank of Ceylon has been in the forefront to drive the country’s economic revival, backing various sectors including businesses and individuals who were affected to weather the crisis and support their recovery during the hardest times. As solicited the major support to revive the economy, the Bank has come up with contemporary measures with the guidance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to revive the economy. The Bank has also played a critical role in ensuring the smooth functioning of Government activities during the crisis in addition to continued lending to the Government, state-owned enterprises and large-scale infrastructure projects. 
As we emphasised previously, the major projects of the country keep moving on amidst many challenges and as always, BOC is aligned to the country’s national development agenda and will continue to support key sectors including government projects, petroleum housing and urban development, agriculture, construction, tourism, apparel, transport, education, health, hospitals, pharmaceuticals, aquaculture and fishing, real estate, exports, local manufacturing and information technology and many more.  
Bank of Ceylon, being the No. 1 Bank and premier State Bank has been in the forefront in executing the relief packages and introducing novel digital banking products to uplift the entire economy and realising the aspirations of citizens of Sri Lanka. Standing tall as a pillar of support to its valuable clientele with unwavering support, the Bank has established a revival unit with a prime objective of reinforcing the collapsed or disrupted businesses considering as a timely additional support during the pandemic situation. Also, the bank has profoundly realised the needy sectors and came up with innovative banking products and services to address such needs as well.
As the Bank gears up for 2021 as the leading financial institution, Bank of Ceylon has proven its resilience particularly in trying times with the global pandemic. The bank emerged as the best financial provider under the ‘Saubhagya’ concessionary loan schemes and extended moratoriums in order to fulfil the aspirations of the business community in Sri Lanka while owing to robust asset base amounting to a more than three trillion asset base. The Bank recorded a commendable loan growth of 28% to reflecting its proactive efforts to direct funding towards priority and important sectors of the economy including major development projects, businesses and households. 
During the first quarter of year 2021, as the explicit continuous growth, the Bank has been able to augment its advance portfolio up to Rs. 2.25 trillion which witnessed its unparallel stance in the industry as at 31 March 2021. During the first quarter the bank expanded its loans and advances portfolio by a significant amount of Rs. 182.7 billion which is a momentum growth of 8.7%. 
Bank of Ceylon has been an integral partner of the development agenda of the country from its inception through the long journey of more than eight decades in the banking industry. Being the bedrock of the major development pertaining to economic and social infrastructure in the country, Bank of Ceylon has a long way to fulfil its national duty and to drive economic growth, financial inclusion and socio-economic empowerment in the country.

Bank of Ceylon (BOC) the premier commercial bank in Sri Lanka adopts a novel humanitarian approach in debt recoveries through a special recovery unit. In Sri Lanka, all commercial banks are governed by a set of rules and regulations in lending and recoveries set out by the Central Bank. 





BOC Deputy General Manager – Recovery Provinces, Business Revival and Rehabilitation Rohana Kumara




However recent unexpected happenings globally as well as locally, affected activities in the Sri Lankan economic landscape causing major setbacks to domestic as well as other investments in an unprecedented manner. 
In this backdrop the Sri Lankan economy faced severe hardships due to the standstill and the crippling effect on the vital economic indicators of the country. This occurred due to the extraordinary spread of new COVID-19 pandemic which affected nations across the world and the Easter Sunday terror attack two years ago in Sri Lanka.
BOC Deputy General Manager – Recovery Provinces, Business Revival and Rehabilitation Rohana Kumara explained the novel mechanism which the bank adopts to recover advances made to the bank’s loyal business customers in an amicable and more prudent manner. This was very difficult than the stringent recovery policy which banks are normally supposed to adopt in recovery of advanced money from the so called past-due or defaulted customers.
Kumara noted that as a government sector institution the bank’s recovery policy took a new turn from the conventional banking practices and adopted a different approach by viewing the business in a more progressive manner. 
Explaining further Kumara noted, most of the corporate businesses which were affected very badly by the Easter Sunday terror attack and the COVID-19 outbreak were helpless. They faced a situation where they could not recover due to the sinking nature, they face in the economy with either curtailed or limited avenues to pursue in their normal activities – the situation was forcing them into insolvency. Many among these were well to do businesses which had generated employment opportunities to many and all those were faced with a debacle that would become a burden to the economy.
The Government and the Central Bank introduced many concessionary loan schemes to uplift these falling businesses. However, considering the losses incurred by these businesses, it was essential to assist the Government with its economic revival agenda going beyond the assistance provided by working capital loans under ‘Saubhagya’ scheme.
Customers with long-lasting unblemished relationships with BOC cannot be left alone. “It is prudent to think outside the box and help them,” Kumara said. BOC decided to review these customers’ businesses and help them to get into the main track of profitability, Kumara stressed.
Adhering to normal banking procedure in such a scenario these businesses will be considered as defaulters and face the inevitable end of extinction. “As a responsible bank we do not want that to happen to the loyal and long-standing customers hence the main intent of the bank is to revive them where both parties will be benefited.”
With this unique vision in mind bank decided to establish a special unit separate from the regular banks’ recovery division and transferred all these selected corporate level business customers with a view to reviving them. These businesses are not viewed as past due customers with defaulters’ intent but businesses with genuine recovery ability and intent.
The Bank of Ceylon has commenced activities of this unit in January, and in March, about 14 categories were identified for revival and more than 10 are within the final phase of recovery. Total debt with direct and indirect facilities so far revived is over Rs. 30 billion. Kumara further stressed that the bank has plans of extending these services to provinces and small and medium scale business as well in the future and the indication is this is getting more popular day by day among genuine customers.
At present a new credit policy to accommodate special concessions and terms is completed and presented for approval he said. Once approval is granted the bank intends expanding this business revival policy to many sectors and accommodates the regions. These reviews do not offer total interest waivers but some possible waivers and some other special concessions Kumara explained. 
The prerequisite in the revival scheme is the businesses should be able to submit to the bank an acceptable business plan. However, if any business needs guidelines and help to provide such a plan the bank is willing to help them to do so. Kumara was very positive about the success of this revival scheme and quipped customers revived during the last couple of months have paid their dues on time and this is a very positive indicator towards this scheme’s success.  “the industries for revival are selected through a very stringent review process following all the financial guidelines, also the credit committee of the bank which is headed by the General Manager and consisting of many DGMs have the final review on all the credit concessions and revival decisions this unit takes,” Kumara noted. “The Chairman of the Bank and the members of the Board of Directors too are very keen on the progress of the revival plans approved and regularly review the position of the reviewed businesses. Most of the selected revivers’ balance sheets and debt ratios are not within normal banking norms but if our review indicates going by their past behaviour pattern, a revival is possible within a two-to-three-year period, the bank considers them as a suitable business for revival,” he further explained. 
The Bank of Ceylon is the first bank to establish a unit of this nature. There is a good demand, many other banks have expressed their willingness to emulate us and are taking steps to revive the affected businesses. Expressing the hope of extending this facility to many more customers/businesses, Kumara concluded the discussion with the note that the Bank of Ceylon’s priority in a nutshell is to give prominence to the recovery of the economy.

European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium - Reuters 

 
LONDON (REUTERS): European Union regulators are considering tougher scrutiny of foreign bank branches in the bloc whose ranks have been swelled by Brexit to create “negative risks”, sources familiar with the discussions have said.
It is the latest sign of how the departure of Britain, Europe’s biggest financial centre, from the EU is causing a rethink in Brussels of how to regulate the sector.
The bloc’s European Banking Authority gave a presentation to EU officials earlier this month setting out the rapid growth in third country bank branches, the sources said.
By December 2020 when Britain left the EU, there were 106 branches of foreign banks across 17 of the 27 member states, holding 510 billion euros ($ 623.53 billion) in assets, the sources said of the presentation.
The branches are concentrated in Belgium, France, Germany and Luxembourg, those attending the meeting were told.
Since Brexit, there are 14 more branches and a 30% increase in assets, or 120.5 billion euros, compared with totals at the end of 2019.
Most of the branches are for banks from China, Britain, Iran, the United States and Lebanon.
EBA told the meeting there were “regulatory arbitrage opportunities” due to a patchwork of national waivers for branches from capital and liquidity rules. While branches of foreign banks are only allowed to operate in the EU state they are based, they have links across the bloc’s internal market, especially those involved in wholesale market operations, the sources said.
EBA noted a “risk of negative cross-border spill-over effects”, the sources said.
The EU is introducing new rules for non-EU banking groups, requiring them to consolidate their operations under an “intermediate parent undertaking” or IPU.
The aim of an IPU is to help EU supervisors make sure foreign banks have enough capital in the bloc and make it easier to close them down when in trouble. But the EBA noted that even though the IPU system is being rolled out, activities may still be carried out via third country branches outside the new EU rules.

Nations Trust Bank yesterday announced the finalisation of a loan facility of $ 40 million from FMO, the Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank. 






Nations Trust Bank Director/Chief Executive Officer Priyantha Talwatte




Supporting the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector affected most by the pandemic, the funds are to be used towards the revival and growth of the Bank’s SME portfolio, in order to ensure lives and livelihoods are protected and new employment is created.
Nations Trust Bank’s business value proposition has a clear focus on enterprise development. Over the years, the Bank has introduced several strategic initiatives to support the SME sector through sharing of expertise, facilitating training programmes and mentoring businesses. 
The Bank stated that it will focus its funding to local manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, value-added agriculture, women-led businesses, and export-oriented business which in turn will generate the much-needed foreign exchange flow into Sri Lanka and aid in building a resilient national economy.
Nations Trust Bank Director/Chief Executive Officer Priyantha Talwatte said: “The facility extended by FMO will enable us to support the growth of our SME clients and to provide solutions which are relevant at each stage of the customer’s business lifecycle. It will contribute to narrowing the SME-financing gap and boosting financial inclusion, a goal shared by Nations Trust Bank and FMO.” 
“These funds will support the Bank’s own ‘Diriya’ program which was floated to support the revival of business with the advent of the pandemic. Our strong and longstanding relationship with FMO has made this facility possible and stands testament to Nations Trust Bank’s continuous ability to transact with international lenders to support in local business rebuilding activity,” Talwatte added.
FMO has worked closely with Nations Trust Bank since 2004 and partnered to provide the Bank with access to long-term funding which has become more challenging due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The ability to attract five-year funds would further strengthen the liquidity position of the Bank’s balance sheet while, FMO’s long term credit appetite on Nations Trust Bank reflects the stability and strength of the Nations Trust Bank franchise. Qualifying for FMO funds also demonstrate that the Bank’s social and environmental criteria meet international standards,” Talwatte added.
Financial Institutions Director Marnix Monsfort said: “FMO is very pleased that we can once again engage with Nations Trust Bank to support them in their strategic journey of supporting SMEs. By contributing to further narrowing the SME-financing gap, Nations Trust Bank can and will boost financial inclusion to various underserved segments, one of the goals highly supported by FMO.” 
The SME sector plays a significant role in facilitating the country’s economic growth, with more than 80% of businesses in Sri Lanka being SMEs, while also providing 70% of employment. As such, supporting SMEs to recommence business activities, despite multiple challenges posed by the pandemic, was a key agenda of the Bank in the past year. Towards achieving this objective, Nations Trust Bank has actively engaged with all SME businesses to offer customised financing solutions and advisory support to facilitate sustainable growth. Apart from actively partnering with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for the ‘Saubhagya’ business support loan scheme, Nations Trust Bank has already disbursed over Rs. 20 billion towards the internally generated fund under ‘Nations Diriya’ dedicated to extending financial support to a range of industries engaged in direct or indirect export-oriented business and in local manufacturing.

LONDON (REUTERS): Around 4.5% of all bitcoin mining takes place in Iran, allowing the country to earn hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies that can be used to buy imports and lessen the impact of sanctions, a new study has found.
At its current level of mining, Iran’s bitcoin production would amount to revenues close $ 1 billion a year, according to figures from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.
Iranian officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
The United States imposes an almost total economic embargo on Iran, including a ban on all imports, including those from the country’s oil, banking and shipping sectors.
While exact figures are “very challenging to determine”, Elliptic estimates are based on data collected from bitcoin miners by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance up to April 2020, and statements from Iran’s state-controlled power generation company in January that up to 600 MW of electricity was being consumed by miners.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created through a process known as mining, where powerful computers compete with each other to solve complex mathematical problems. The process is energy-intensive, often relying on electricity generated by fossil fuels which Iran is rich in.
The country’s central bank prohibits the trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mined overseas, although the currencies are widely available on the black market, according to local media reports.
Iran officially recognised crypto mining as an industry in recent years, offering it cheap power and requiring miners to sell their mined bitcoins to the central bank. The prospect of cheap power has attracted more miners, particularly from China, into the country. Teheran allows cryptocurrencies mined in Iran to pay for imports of authorised goods.
“Iran has recognised that bitcoin mining represents an attractive opportunity for a sanctions-hit economy suffering from a shortage of hard cash, but with a surplus of oil and natural gas,” the study finds.
The electricity being used by miners in Iran would require the equivalent of around 10 million barrels of crude oil each year to generate, around 4% of total Iranian oil exports in 2020, according to the study.
“The Iranian state is therefore effectively selling its energy reserves on the global markets, using the Bitcoin mining process to bypass trade embargoes,” the study reads.
“Iran-based miners are paid directly in Bitcoin, which can then be used to pay for imports – allowing sanctions on payments through Iranian financial institutions to be circumvented.” 
Financial firms that have started offering cryptocurrency services, particularly in the United States, should consider potential sanctions they are exposed to due to Iranian bitcoin mining, Elliptic said.

Bitcoin came from nowhere and is now here to stay 
 

By Dr. R.R. de Silva

The pursuit of US legislators against the cryptocurrency space, providers, traders and users, is driven by the requirement to protect an ancient Jewish monetary system and world order consisting of governments, private central banks, commercial banks, development banks, IMF, WB, physical currency i.e. the US Dollar, interest rates and the money markets.
An intricate system, which forms the cornerstone of the prevailing global civilisation, forms the foundations of layers upon layers of secondary, tertiary systems including stock markets, global trading, the financial education system, the study of economics, business, finance, investment markets, etc., and business lifestyle. The monetary system has become a way of life upon which money forms cause to action and controls the world. 
History has been littered with assassinations driven by money and disruption of the prevailing world order. Whether SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 is part of this is yet to emerge. Whether MERS and or SARS were failed predecessors is just as difficult to ascertain. But one thing has definitely changed, a new contender and challenger has emerged out of the dust of the 2009/10 so-called Global Financial Crisis (GFC) affecting predominately the developed world. 
Designed by Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever this may be, in 2008 and launched in 2009, this contender is called Bitcoin (BTC), a revolutionary form of digital currency or digital gold using the blockchain as its underlying technology. Decentralised, democratic, limited to a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins, this digital coin signifies freedom and uncontrollability except when the lights go off. Bitcoin has conquered the hearts of the free world, an ideology extending beyond governments, taxation, surveillance capitalism and authoritarian totalitarianism. A world free of Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), wire fraud and limitless quantitative easing.
Initially vilified by many including the Jewish merchant banks e.g. Jamie Dimon CEO and Chairman of JP Morgan, the free world has endorsed and ensured cryptocurrency’s survival, sometimes at great risk and cost. Built out of ideology, identifying these creational individuals proved too difficult for the establishment. Its decentralised nature making it impossible to track and trace singular ownership highlighting the power of the deontological collective vs. the divide and rule policies of imperial colonial establishment. 
I suppose if you can’t beat them then join them. With governments looking to create their own digital currencies, its success stands in stark contrast to cryptocurrency. Government styled digital currency’s singular purpose is to track and trace monetary assets, to control through surveillance and taxation policy the wealth of the population, and to identify potential alternative thinkers, and keep them under control using amongst their arsenal of multiple tools monetary control and fiscal control. Taxes such as Inheritance Tax, Capital Gains Tax, and Personal Taxation are all created to keep you and your progeny controllable, helpless and unheard.
To date central banks collude with government, corporates and banks via direct influence and or indirectly via lobbyists to facilitate policy to maintain the socio-economic divide between elite establishment and the proletariat.
 
Now unstoppable
Bitcoin, now unstoppable, having survived over 10 years with significant price volatility and currently trading above $ 18,000 per bitcoin, who now can deny its existence or value. Previously demonised as an instrument of dark trades, drugs, wire fraud and money laundering, only few asked the question as how money laundering and the drug trade survived before bitcoin. These trades still survive denominated in USD with a market capitalisation of in the trillions compared to an approximate $ 350 billion market capitalisation of BTC. 
As a decentralised monetary system democratises money removing requirement for central banks governments IMF WB Interest rates Non requirement for FX markets, transfer protocols e.g. SWIFT CHAPS BACS a far fairer system of monetary value has emerged with no biased policy uninfluenced by western and semitic control. A true one set of rules for all. A system you can believe in. An infinite game instead of the finite game.
As more and more join an inevitability, it is clear Bitcoin has a future and with it choice and people’s freedom. Where many had sacrificed their lives for freedom, sacrifice is being traded for entitlement and with entitlement has grown complacency, arrogance and an almost narcissistic demand for rights? 
In the midst of all this, we find fellow Sri Lankans such as Kosala Hemachandra who developed the MyEtherWallet. Maybe it is now time, for us, for Sri Lankans and Sri Lanka to believe in ourselves and charge through the open doors to a greater world. Out there lies 7.5 billion people, just waiting for our contribution and solutions. It is time for policy and Sri Lanka to empower us to develop ourselves beyond the boundaries of our coastline.
 It is time to develop new skills, embrace risk, bridge the divides, indulge in falling just to pick ourselves up and all the while maintaining our own evolving Sri Lankan identity. Most important of all, it is time to appreciate what we have, who we are and who we represent, our country, our friends and family and to treat each other as a brother in need. 
Many dinosaurs of the traditional investment game shared their sermons on Bitcoin for a host of reasons. Take for example Warren Buffet, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, deemed a legendary investor and known as the Oracle of Omaha. Buffet, a highly successful billionaire investor talks about innovation from the perspective of a traditionalist. He has made several negative statements on Bitcoin including on 7 May 2018 Buffet speaks to CNBC stating, “Bitcoin is an asset that creates nothing.” 
The following year on 25 February 2019 he states, “Bitcoin has no unique value.” On 24 February 2020 Buffett speaks to CNBC and describes Bitcoin as worthless. “Cryptocurrencies basically have no value…they don’t produce anything.” “You can’t do anything with it except sell it to somebody else,” he added. “But then that person’s got the problem.” “I don’t own any cryptocurrency,” he said. “I never will.”
As Charles Darwin writes in his paper dating 1858 and in his book ‘On the Origin of Species of 1859’, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change”. This is the true essence of Darwin’s manuscripts as opposed to the more commonly touted “survival of the fittest.”
We are now seeing a shift in Bitcoin buyer demographics from techies to institutionals, corporates and the monetary elite entering the cryptocurrency space. From novelty fraudulent scams to institutional adoption. Even the older generations, forcibly recruited into digitalisation by global social isolation and human rights violating lockdowns, have been purchasing Bitcoin. This may have contributed to demystification of cryptocurrencies but also low or negative interest rates and a stock market at all-time highs despite an economic disconnect and a possible pending credit market collapse.
Grayscale Investments announced recently assets under management in excess of $ 10 billion with over 500,000 BTC in its Trust Funds with the majority held in its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).
On 20 November 2020 Blackrock’s (world’s largest asset management firm with $ 8 trillion) Rick Rieder spoke to CNN and CNBC stating Bitcoin could replace Gold as a go-to safe haven investment. “Do I think it’s a durable mechanism that could take the place of gold to a large extent? Yeah, I do, because it’s so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around,” Rieder said. It has taken 11 years for the biggest names in traditional investment to endorse Bitcoin. Microstrategy Inc. (MSTR), a company providing tech solutions and listed on the NASDAQ, used a significant portion of its balance sheet to buy BTC. MSTR announced in June 2020 it had purchased 38,250 BTC worth $ 425 million at an average $ 11,111 per coin. On 20 November 2020 BTC hit $ 18,666 equating to a total value of $ 714 million and reflecting a paper profit of $ 289 million. As a result Microstrategy’s share price rocketed to $ 271 per share as of 27/11/20 raising its market capitalisation over and above the uplift in value of the $ 289 million BTC profit. Other corporates have also purchased Bitcoin, including Square, Hut & Ming Corp, Galaxy Digital Holdings, etc.
Ricardo Pliego Mexico’s second wealthiest person with an estimated fortune of $ 11.9 billion has placed 10% of his liquid cash into Bitcoin to protect his wealth from hyperinflationary devaluation. He is part of an ever-increasing band of millionaires and billionaires diversifying their risk into Bitcoin.
Endorsements are flooding in with recently PayPal (PYPL) allowing you to buy Bitcoin through them alongside several new wealth management mobile applications. Influential hedge fund managers like Stanley Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones have been touting Bitcoin as an investment.
Governments have even issued their own cryptocurrencies including China, Ecuador and Singapore with Estonia, Japan, Sweden and Russia considering launching new national digital currencies. It would be interesting to see if politicians buy or have bought Bitcoin lured by market beating returns laced with hypocritical greed. Maybe governments should now consider pegging their hyperinflationary currencies due to decadal quantitative easing programs against Bitcoin, the new digital gold or at least re-consider that real yellow thing called gold.
With China running over 50% of global Bitcoin mining operations it would not surprise me, if the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) already owned significant amounts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Certainly running their own national digital currency would suit their authoritarian totalitarian mindset with Western nations looking to exert themselves similarly. 
 
Dilute government clutches
Governments and corporates will work together to develop policy to control cryptocurrency to their best advantage. Their success will be questionable as an evolving conflict between policymakers looking to institutionalise and centralise all power and control over cryptocurrency and the free world looking to dilute government clutches and maintain untouchable decentralisation.
Maybe the rise of Bitcoin is a direct reflection of humanity’s response to persistent governmental oppression and surveillance capitalism. Antiquated uneducated narcissistic politicians fighting to preserve the existing world order exhibit regulatory anxiety over decentralised finance and peer-to-peer transactions. These areas lack the intermediaries that regulators require to horde financial data and keep control of their populatory subordinates. 
But any attempt to restrict peer to peer transactions and invade the inner sanctum of all humanity based on natural human interaction will flounder in revolt, violence and accelerated demise of a World Order that has wiped out societies, cultures and the biodiversity of the natural world.
To combat the emergence of alternative non-conformist thought, policymakers have engineered new terminology e.g. Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Client (KYC), Wire fraud and the Modern Slavery Act. This new language has proliferated under Global Finance through interwoven international institutions e.g. International Monetary Fund (IMF), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the World Bank to name a few. All this has been implemented to control, detect and disrupt illicit financial activity. Illicit as defined by those who wish to maintain control over the world. 
But today a new order has emerged, a new school of thought, decentralised, community run and led, a collective, the very thing the establishment hates and has sought to divide through ultra-invasive multi-channel methodologies and narratives of individualism, consumerism, materialism, feminism, gender pay gap, communism and socialism vilification and recently SARS-CoV-2 Kill Fear resulting in the stripping of all rights enshrined in religious faith and constitution. 
Furthermore the US’s AML watchdog, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has recently reduced its reporting standards for international transactions from $ 3,000 to $ 250 while expanding a list of enforcement against cryptocurrency firms.
The consequences of mainstream adoption may drive low liquidity price acceleration, where bitcoin whales (person(s) or organisations holding in excess of 1000 Bitcoins) control and manipulate a currently investment style trading market. It seems however that legislators are more concerned with controlling the small individual looking to regulate offline non-custodial wallets (safest option to hold crypto) and peer to peer transactions where overzealous government control freaks search for opportunities to exert their power in an ever failing cycle to protect their own positions and their subscribed world order. They are looking to block all peer to peer transactions. Is this individualised social isolation policy with SARS-CoV-2 a tiny part of a grander picture in a four dimensional multi-channel strategy of depopulation?
On lighter tones, Laszio Hanyecz agreed to pay 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s Pizzas on 22 May 2010! That would be in the region of $ 186.66 million for two pizzas! (20-11-20 USD/BTC $ 18,666). Surprisingly enough Bitcoin has been and can be used as currency where people can and have been able to buy real expensive pizza, cars and even flats. It is up to us to decide our futures and we always have a choice. Seeing opportunity and seeing choices is a reflection of our ability to adapt in adversity. 
 
An investment or a currency?
In this context, a commonly-posed question by mainly regulators relates to the definition of Bitcoin as an investment or a currency. Realistically legislators will define this in terms of fiscal policy independent of Bitcoin’s uses as both currency and an investment instrument and outside of the rules and regulations applicable to FX Trading.
Bitcoin appears to be here to stay. It all boils down to belief, no blind faith required unlike the Greenback’s ‘In God we Trust’ as an unlimited supply of paper flows off the printing press like fake news. No one saw this coming, not even George Orwell’s 1984. Is this our way out?
With global depression at the doorstep, accelerated by globally synchronised lockdowns Bitcoin will protect you against State expropriation of wealth. In Sri Lanka the enactment of the Land Reform Law No. I of 1972, designed to reduce inequality expropriated many. Its purpose to reduce inequality has achieved nothing of its intention and instead has empowered State control and political corruption. Expropriation continues today, this type of behaviour and thought has brought about consistently opportunistic self-serving governments forming the fuel for new change and a new start.
For if you do not believe in Bitcoin, you may want to hedge your bets as the future unfolds. As Ray Dallio says today’s ‘cash is trash’ and we say the dollar is a phoney democracy. 
As more and more join the party, belief in a self-fulfilling prophecy grows. Bitcoin came from nowhere and is now here to stay. Consideration is survival essential. In this game of adoption: “Who will be the laggard?” and “Who will ride the crypto wave and wash everyone away?” In this case early adoption has paid dividends and converted many already into crypto millionaires and billionaires e.g. Niklas Nikolajsen of Bitcoin Suisse. 
One thing is certain, Bitcoin is going to be around for a while yet and for as long as people believe in life free of government oppression. 

(The writer warns that cryptocurrency is and has been highly volatile and you should only buy cryptocurrency after studying its workings and market behaviour. Buying is currently considered high risk in investment terms. You should only invest if you are willing to lose without significantly affecting your personal finances. As with all investments, we should beware of crypto-scams. Buyer Beware.)

REUTERS: Bitcoin dipped 10% to $ 33,747.21 at 14:00 GMT on Sunday, losing $ 3,753.33 from its previous close.
Bitcoin, the world’s biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, is down 48% from the year’s high of $ 64,895.22 on 14 April.
Ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, dropped 14% to $ 1,973.96 on Sunday, losing $ 322.35 from its previous close.
Bitcoin markets operate 24/7, setting the stage for price swings at unpredictable hours.
“Many point to Bitcoin’s volatility as untenable,” wrote RBC Capital Markets’ Amy Wu Silverman in a research note published on Saturday. 
“Indeed, Bitcoin makes severe and dizzying swings.” 
Bitcoin had been under pressure after a series of tweets last week by billionaire Tesla Chief Executive and cryptocurrency backer Elon Musk, chiefly his reversal on Tesla accepting bitcoin as payment.
In addition, on Friday China cracked down on mining and trading of the largest cryptocurrency as part of ongoing efforts to prevent speculative and financial risks.
China’s Financial Stability and Development Committee, chaired by Vice Premier Liu He, singled out bitcoin as the asset it needs to regulate more.
The statement, which came days after three Chinese industry bodies tightened a ban on banks and payment companies providing crypto-related services, was a sharp escalation of the country’s push to stamp out speculation and fraud in virtual currencies.
China’s latest campaign against crypto came after the US Treasury Department on Thursday called for new rules that would require large cryptocurrency transfers to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Reserve flagged the risks cryptocurrencies posed to financial stability.

DFCC Bank - the full-service commercial bank has been rated among the top 100 most valuable consumer brands in Sri Lanka for the year 2021. Ranking 27th in the survey conducted by Brand Finance Sri Lanka, DFCC Bank was able to






DFCC Bank Director/CEO Lakshman Silva




climb up one notch to the 27th position, following last year’s position as the 28th most valuable consumer brand in the country. 
This is an indication of DFCC Bank’s stellar performance, despite the raging pandemic which disturbed the progress of numerous businesses both locally and globally. DFCC Bank was able to successfully strategise and make the best of these challenging times which is now reflected in this in-depth analysis conducted by Brand Finance Sri Lanka.
Brand Finance is the world’s leading independent brand valuation consultancy. Brand Finance was set up in 1996 with the aim of ‘bridging the gap between marketing and finance’. For more than 20 years, the institution has helped companies and organisations of all types to connect their brands to the bottom line.
Voicing his thoughts on this achievement, DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva said: “DFCC Bank has gone through brand transformations over the years. Often, this is a challenge for institutions to endure as public perception of the brand will change, sometimes resulting in the identity of the brand becoming unclear. 
“However throughout our transformation from a development bank to a full service commercial bank, the Bank for Everyone, we have positioned ourselves as a brand that’s close to customers in all walks of life offering customised financial propositions that suits them best carved out using the finest technology that offers convenience to customers.”
Also adding to the sentiment shared, DFCC Bank Vice President – Marketing and Sustainability Nilmini Gunaratne stated: “DFCC’s brand value and strength are extremely useful measures for tracking the brand’s performance in a competitive market. 
“The DFCC brand needed awareness and visibility to be in the top consideration list when customers were selecting a bank of their choice and today to a great extent brand awareness has facilitated to achieve this recognition over a period of time amidst the multiple branding and communication strategies adopted.” 
She concluded by saying that the DFCC brand will continue to carry out brand building initiatives that will create more value and engagement with all stakeholders to further and build brand loyalty and an expanded customer base over a period of time.
Given the current pandemic situation, DFCC has been able to stay top of mind creating top of mind awareness through multiple brand initiatives using digital as a key platform. One such example is the campaign that supported the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s ‘Go Cashless’ campaign to which DFCC supplemented by promoting the Bank’s Virtual Wallet - the campaign communicated to the public that physical contact with cash is not required to carry out day-to-day financial transactions; the DFCC Wallet could be used simply anytime, anywhere to do so at the convenience of the customer. This also re-emphasised the need to adapt digital platforms for contactless banking.

Asia Asset Finance PLC (AAF) has gained Stable Outlook with resilience overcoming growth headwinds in COVID-19 environment, leading credit rating agency ICRA Lanka Ltd. affirmed.
It has revised the outlook of Asia Asset Finance PLC to BBB+[Stable] from BBB+(Negative) considering growth performance with capital, operational, financial and managerial support from its parent company Muthoot Finance Ltd. (MFL).
The outlook revision to Stable from Negative reflects the improvement of the parent entity’s rating and the additional support extended by the parent, as well as the increase in exposure to asset backed lending, including gold loans.
Further, ICRA Lanka noted that the capital adequacy ratios of AAF remains an adequate buffer over the minimum capital requirement (set by the CBSL) continues modest. The company is required to have a minimum core capital requirement of Rs. 2.5 billion by January 2022, which is likely to be met through internal generation and capital infusion by the parent company, ICRA Lanka noted. 
Having a solid asset base in the company and the continuous support of MFL in regaining glitter in the gold loan business has become more resilient in the competition, thus expanding its gold loan base to Rs. 6.5 billion, Asia Asset Finance Chief Executive Officer Rajiv Gunawardena said. 
Further he revealed that the company recorded a tangible net worth of Rs. 1,991 million and reported a net worth of Rs. 2,189 million respectively as of December 2020, which was close to a minimum regulatory core capital requirement of Rs. 2,000 Million by January 2021. 
The parent entity aims to provide a capital infusion of Rs. 500 million in Q1 of FY2022 followed by another capital infusion of Rs. 300 million within the next year.
The ratings take into account MFL’s consent to provide capital support in the future as well to meet the growth and regulatory requirement, the agency said. 
Going forward, with the expected expansion in the gold loan portfolio, AAF expects to further reduce the dependency on public funds and improve the long-term funding sources such as debentures, term loans from banks and securitised borrowings. 
ICRA Lanka revealed that AAF has a fairly diversified funding profile comprising of retail fixed deposits, debentures, term loans from banks and securitised borrowings. 
The funds from fixed deposits have moderated over the years with 50% of the funding base consisting of fixed deposits as in December 2020 in comparison to 52% in March 2020 and 57% in March 2019.

The trading day today at the Colombo Stock Exchange was interesting, and rather surprising. A stock rising over 200% of its IPO price while a possibility, is a matter that should be of concern if there’s a great amount of volatility in such stock. 
The most fundamental principle of investing of all time is “never invest in something you don’t understand”. However, how many of the retail investors in the Colombo Stock Exchange internalizes this concept is a question mark to-date. 
A share market while allowing the free exchange of securities between the market players to facilitate price discovery, also need to be a secure and managed environment that protects market players from any possible corruption, fraud and malpractices. 
The Empower Board being introduced to the Colombo Stock Exchange was a brilliant and commendable move made by the authorities. An increased access to capital for Small and Medium Enterprises is a much needed element for conducive economic growth in a country. However, the investors who invest in such entities need to be afforded adequate protection as well. 
One issue that arises to a retail investor when investing in a stock listed on the Empower Board is the lack of information and track record to make an ‘informed investment decision’. The basic requirement of having a low threshold requirement of two years of operational history in one reason for such a paucity of information. 
What’s interesting is, an ideal solution to such an issue has been already found by the CSE, when issuing and allotting BASEL III Compliant Debt Securities only to a limited audience, namely a set of people called “qualified investors”. The qualified investor will not be the retailer who is trading on the CSE with his pension money or his gratuity trying to make a living out of it. 
Now if such an issue or possible threat of a retail investor losing out on their hard earned money exists by investing in a stock that they don’t have enough information about, isn’t it the ideal solution to limit such stock to the qualified investors too? Open to discussion!

CSE subsidiary Central Depository Systems offers registrar services for issues 
IPOs enabled with E-applications
Virtual AGMs facilitate smooth processes during COVID 
A dedicated unit for Asset Services
E-Access and E-Connect to align with SDGs







Nalin Fonseka

 




Central Depository Systems (Pvt) Ltd (CDS), a fully owned subsidiary of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), has recently diversified its service offerings. Globally, the traditional role of depositories is advancing to achieve more customer-centricity, by offering new services and leveraging on technology. Fronted on the same purpose, CDS in Sri Lanka has diversified on different ends over their evolution. 

Positioning of CDS in the Sri Lankan capital market
CDS was first launched in 1991 to the Sri Lankan capital market with the responsibility of acting as the country’s sole depository for securities listed on the CSE and was established to specialise in the settlement of securities, transactions and the safekeeping of securities on behalf of domestic and international investors. 
With the numerous contributions, CDS has been positioned as the key infrastructure enabler in the Sri Lankan capital market. Currently CDS’s key role can be identified as the custodian for listed company account holders and as a liquidity provider. The same has endorsed investor confidence in terms of the number of accounts, the quantity in custody and the value of securities held at the Depository.
Maintaining a data base of this magnitude is a challenging yet a crucial role for the sustainment of the stock exchange. But with an extensive experience of three decades in serving the capital market and being ranked as the first in the Asia Pacific region and the seventh globally, CDS has placed themselves in a globally renowned disposition. 
CDS is equipped with the capability and the capacity to serve the industry in its present magnitude and to successfully support its prospective expansion. This is demonstrated by the number of trades cleared and settled without any interruption to date, over the history.

Diversification of CDS service offerings
CDS has expanded their service offerings to include registrar services for issues of companies listing on the CSE which is an advancing integration into their value chain. With this introduction, the newest listing at CSE, Chrissworld Ltd. has received services of CDS as their registrar. CDS also added a new feature of E-IPO applications for Chrissworld IPO, enabling further streamlined IPO processes.
Commenting on the recent additions to its service offerings, CDS Head Nalin Fonseka added: “The capital market is driven through secure and convenient solutions, and as a pivotal point in the Sri Lankan Stock Market we have always led with the objective to achieve beyond our core function and evolve as a diversified service provider with stakeholder focus in priority. 
“Over the history of CDS, it has been our constant belief that investor confidence is the key to the market sustainability. The diversification drive was launched with a view to lift the service standard and thereby investor confidence.”
He further explained CDS’s approach to diversification, adding that CDS has advanced an extra mile by launching a dedicated unit which could concentrate totally on assets servicing. Operations of this unit would come under the purview of the CDS and the formalisation of the operations was done three years back. 
Services offered by this unit has multiple benefits to listed companies and investors. This unit has the capability to handle any type of corporate actions. “Best example was the dividend payments, listed company used digital platforms to pay dividend directly to the account holder’s bank account on the date of payment announced by the listed company.”

Leverage on technology
State-of-the-art technology that CDS has adopted to handle routine operations is another testament to the capacity that the organisation holds. CDS has identified technology to be their key pillar for constant growth and CDS leverage on the technology for all services to compete and offer variety of services to the industry.
In striving to constantly encourage a technological eco-system and attract potential investors, CDS has offered multiple solutions. Recently launched Online IPO Application system, a popular addition among the investor community is one such advancement. 
This has contributed towards the substantial turnover growth and the remarkable growth in number of mobile application downloads. Currently this facility is only available for local investors and the progress is underway to extend the same to foreign investors in the recent future.
CDS has handled seven Annual General Meetings (AGM) to some of the leading listed companies and is known as the first service provider to handle virtual AGMs. Virtual AGMs served as a valuable asset for companies and investors during the COVID pandemic as it enabled a smooth continuation of processes.
Investor account opening process plays a pivotal role in stock market investments. Therefore, Digital Onboarding, which is introduced with a key contribution from Broker firm representatives eliminates physical documentation submission process and attracted a number of investors to the market. This initiative, which was initiated by the CSE and SEC joint committee, was well accepted by the investor community.
CDS is very confident of a stock market presenting itself as a total online digital end-to-end solution for investor community. Commenting on prospective digital developments, CDS commented: “We are developing a dedicated e-Access platform, for investors to access all CDS account requirements via the convenience of simple press of a button. 
“The facility is projected to be launched by the end of 2021. This initiative is equally aligned with the responsible Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) element that CDS constantly strives to achieve. The process of submitting paper documents will totally be replaced with the implementation of the E-Connect, the portal which provides all online Depository solutions to the investor community and the listed companies.”

Expert financial planner NDB Wealth Management encourages individuals and businesses to focus on how being socially responsible is equally important as being financially responsible. 
Given that the nation and world at large are facing turbulent and challenging times due to the pandemic situation, as a responsible corporate citizen NDB Wealth Management is specially focusing on the safety and wellbeing of their valuable investors. 
“It is our duty and moral obligation to conduct ourselves in a socially responsible manner especially due to the current pandemic situation. Each one of us has a role to play to support and advocate for social responsibility by which we can encourage those near and dear as well as our communities to follow proper health guidelines bearing in mind not only our best interests but those of society as a whole,” commented NDB Wealth Management CEO Prabodha Samarasekera.
Through united efforts, society can combat the COVID virus and prevent it from spreading exponentially through the best practices of washing hands and proper sanitisation, maintaining social distancing at all times, strictly adhering to the guidelines stipulated by the health officials and restricting our movements and avoiding large group gatherings unnecessarily. 
Whilst working towards being socially responsible, each one has to also work towards being financially responsible. Financial responsibility is an essential and core area requiring attention by many. Being able to financially support oneself without burdening others or reducing dependency on society including governing institutions and other authorities should be a key focus and aim among individuals and businesses alike. NDB Wealth Management through their expertise and experience can help individuals and businesses plan and prepare for financial growth despite unexpected situations. 
Outlining a few techniques on financial responsibility, Prabodha stated, “Stabilising your income through employment and business ventures, setting achievable financial goals and educating yourself on financial matters are a few topics worthy of consideration. Especially for the younger generations, the aspiration to be financially stable and secure can propel them to achieve greater heights.”
“However not everyone is financially savvy and added efforts should be taken to be updated on the financial schemes available. A good budgeting practice will also help to maintain the income and expenditure while enabling individuals to initiate savings and avoiding unnecessary, expensive debt. It’s important to understand the importance of financial planning and to have a good idea on how you can allow your earnings to bring benefits for you in the future. At NDB Wealth we offer an array of plans to help one prepare for the future.

CFA Institute Research Foundation: Asia-Pacific emerging and frontier markets continue to evolve rapidly. With insights from authors based in 11 local markets, this publication offers insights about regulatory developments, market structure, and financial history in the region.

Overview
Emerging and frontier financial markets in the Asia-Pacific region have experienced significant changes in recent years in areas affecting regulation, market participants, and products. 
This collection presents perspectives from authors in local markets who provide their analysis of the history, current development, and future outlook for 11 countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam. 
The brief should be particularly valuable for prospective investors interested in learning about regulatory developments, market structure, and financial history in the region.

Introduction
Many have argued that the 21st century will be the Asian Century. And yet many capital markets in Asia, particularly emerging markets, remain a mystery to much of the outside world. We hope this brief will help to fill that knowledge gap.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Asia Index, launched at the beginning of the century, includes nine markets today. The relatively large and liquid capital markets of China (A shares), South Korea, and Taiwan are better known in global markets partly because of the international success of local tech giants. 
This brief covers the remaining six markets in the index—India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand—plus five other up-and-coming Asian markets—Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. In each chapter, local authors review the history, current characteristics, and challenges and opportunities of their respective capital markets.
The selected countries exhibit certain economic and financial similarities. Having travelled to the majority of the covered countries, we believe they also have another important attribute in common: hope. 
These countries witnessed how neighbours such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and, more recently, China have improved living standards for their people since the 1960s. Their citizens share a strong belief that hard work will pay off. So, despite conditions that many from developed markets may find challenging, throughout these countries you can hear the upbeat tone in the voices and see the smiles on the faces of people going about their business.
Still, these markets are substantially different in many ways. We venture three differences here to highlight the practical value of this brief:

History
Countries such as India, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka inherited a legal system influenced by the British system. Some even had exchanges set up centuries ago. Because of their history, their capital markets are more consistent with expectations formed from investing in the US or UK markets. 
In contrast, Mongolia and Vietnam were part of the Soviet area of influence after the Second World War. Their regulatory systems are now in transition toward Western standards.

Economy
The size of these economies varies greatly. Based on data from the World Bank, in 2019, India’s GDP was $ 2,875 billion and Indonesia’s was $ 1,119 billion. On the other end of the spectrum, in 2019 Mongolia had a GDP of $ 13.9 billion and Cambodia of $ 27.1 billion. GDP per capita in 2019 ranges from $ 1,285 for Pakistan to $ 11,415 for Malaysia. 
This disparity is of course an important consideration for institutional investors because the economy is the foundation of capital markets and the main driver of their growth. Asian economies in general have experienced healthy growth in recent decades, and so have many of the covered countries, other than those that witnessed political turmoil. Consistent with these economic differences, the size of capital markets differs greatly among the 11 countries covered.

Market maturity
Market maturity is an important factor to consider when investing in emerging and frontier markets. More-mature markets offer increased levels of information disclosure and tend to experience less dramatic swings in prices. Where data is available, authors report the share of institutional ownership in a market and other indicators of market maturity.
History buffs may find it easy to understand why in some markets banking channels play a more important role in financing, whereas in others capital markets are more important—although market maturity also has some bearing on this.
The concept of the Asian Century was not without controversy from the beginning. Whether you are a believer or a sceptic, we sincerely hope that this research brief will help you identify new opportunities and navigate risks in the Asian emerging and frontier markets.
Look for the full collection in 2021. We will release the market chapters as they become available.

Key picks are large, diversified players and banks with niche exposure


By Asia Securities Research

The recent year has seen the banking sector facing multiple storms, with sector valuations facing pressure even before the pandemic. Heightened political risk, lower foreign investor interest, and rights issues related to Basel III capital raising, resulted in a free-fall of the sector valuations since 2018. Sector valuations hit a decade low over the last two years due to poor economic growth, the Easter attack impact, and COVID-19-related concerns. However, we note that banks have managed to successfully navigate this turbulence, by adjusting its strategy and also managing risks prudently by increasing provisioning. While low interest rates and a surge in impairment charges meant that banks saw soft profitability in 2020, contrary to investor concerns, the sector posted a modest increase in ROEs. Asia Securities’ latest Banking Sector Outlook 2021 titled, ‘Rising Above the Clouds: Charting the Course for the Growth Phase,’ weighs in on the trends driving the sector’s performance, the COVID-19 implications, as well as the future of the banking sector.

Banks, a cyclical play to see an upward re-rating along with the next growth cycle
The Asia Securities report argues that there is potential for the sector valuations to re-rate upwards as the economic cycle picks up. This positive outlook underpins the thesis that as a cyclical play, banks would see ROEs expand in 2021 and 2022, mainly driven by improving top line and a drop in impairments. Several macro catalysts including stable fiscal policies, commitment to maintaining low interest rates, low consumption taxes are expected to drive private sector credit growth, and lower interest burden for borrowers, lending itself to the sector’s recovery story. Banking stocks took the biggest hit in 2020 during the pandemic, and currently trade at 0.5x 2021 forecasted book value, providing an attractive entry point for investors with a medium-term focus. 
The report highlights Asia Securities’ expectation of private sector credit growth picking up to approx. 10% in 2021, driven mostly by corporate and retail lending. While the report also forecasts a pickup in SME lending, this would be mainly weighted towards the second half of 2021 once economic activities stabilise. The third wave of COVID infections poses a slight threat in this regard, and curbing the spread becomes an important factor to watch.  The report also notes that market interest rates are expected to pick up from 2H 2021, driven by higher credit growth as the Government fulfils its refinancing needs in the market. Given the loan book structure of the banks, Asia Securities expects AWPLR to increase faster than AWDR, driving up loan yields. In addition, as banks utilise its excess liquidity and lower its dependence on deposits and borrowings, cost of funds is expected to show only marginal growth.

Improving asset quality and lower taxes add a further tailwind to profitability 
The report also forecasts that non-performing loan stock will moderate in 2021, continuing the trend in 4Q 2020. Given the expectations of an economic expansion, the report forecasts a downward trend in the provisioning from 2021 onwards, in turn, leading to a drop in P&L impairment charges in 2021. However, external shocks, weather events impacting the agriculture sector, or a prolonged third wave would pose some threat to this estimate as banks may see it prudent to increase provisioning. 
Adding a further tailwind to profitability is the proposal to reduce corporate income tax to 24% from 28%, which was presented to Parliament in March. Although Sri Lanka’s digital banking space has been growing, it is still at a nascent stage and has strong potential to structurally push up bank ROEs. The rise in e-commerce and online transactions also offers a significant opportunity in this regard. While the sector as a whole has pushed more into digital banking in 2020, more user adoption in the coming years could structurally lift sector ROEs similar to what is seen across the developed markets.

Strong capitalisation to drive growth; foreign investor activity would further help valuations
The Asia Securities’ report also notes that banks are well-capitalised to drive growth in the next few years following Basel III capital requirements. Given the positive growth outlook on growth, banks are expected to maintain a strong payout, although, scrip dividends are likely to remain a key component of dividends in 2021 and 2022. 
The report also acknowledges concerns around the impact of ongoing moratoriums, highlighting that a worst-case scenario for valuations may see the sector trading at 0.6x-0.7x on forecasted 2021 book value. USD debt repayments would continue to be a major concern in foreign investors’ mind, and until a sustainable financing solution is visible, this is likely to weigh in on valuations. As large, stable and diversified players are still undervalued compared to historic levels, the report recommends investors focus on the diversified large banks as value picks and mid-tier/small banks as growth stocks. While regionally Sri Lankan banks are cheap, relative to its return and growth profile, foreign investors are likely to continue remain cautious on investing in Sri Lanka due to the overall perception of macro risks, and the lack of visibility around post-moratorium performance of asset quality. With the dust likely settling around both these factors around 2H 2021, Asia Securities notes that foreign investor interest is likely to return, pushing up valuations further through a multiple re-rating.

From left: DirectPay team comprising Chief Operating Officer/Co-Founder Sasindu Pathiranage, Founder/CEO Kanishka Weeramunda and Co-Founder/Director Dinesh Karunathilaka 

Founded in 2018 as a fintech startup to revolutionise the cashless payments arena of Sri Lanka, DirectPay has come a long way in terms of product reach and innovations. Enabling financial inclusion to all citizens, DirectPay offers cashless payment methods, providing affordability and accessibility with convenience and agility. 
Given the pandemic, helping Sri Lanka progress towards becoming a cashless society similar to the likes of regional powerhouses such as Singapore and China, is an agenda of DirectPay over the next one year. As such, they are dedicated to ensuring that the local payments landscape is on par with international advancements, including security, quality and innovations aspects. 
Explaining the product concept, Founder Kanishka Weeramunda, who accounts for more than 20 years of experience in ICT and is also the Founder of PayMedia said: “DirectPay is an electronic payment option providing a viable alternative to cash, where users can either scan a QR code, enter their card details or use any of their bank accounts to make a payment. This could be either through a mobile-based payment app, an internet payment gateway, a payment link to receive remote payments, subscription payments where there’s a recurring revenue or it could be a bill settlement, all of which ensure a seamless journey to customers or service providers, covering the entire payment ecosystem. The beginnings of DirectPay was inspired from the insight of seeing people relying on their phones to carry out a majority of their activities. We wanted to add payments to the list, thus eliminating the burden of carrying a wallet, notes and coins.” 
Driven by the firm’s mission to deliver the world’s best payment experiences to customers, Kanishka emphasised that DirectPay was created to provide transactions that facilitated lesser cost with added convenience. He explained: “We are essentially a fintech service provider under the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, that works in tandem with Commercial Bank, Cargills Bank and Nations Trust Bank as our acquiring banks. DirectPay is committed to the digitalisation of payments by introducing solutions to establish a digital payment ecosystem in Sri Lanka.” 
DirectPay having seen tremendous growth in the B2B segment during the last financial year owing to the pandemic is keen on moving towards digital modes of accepting payments. Identifying this change of market behaviour, DirectPay has introduced several products for micro SMEs to accept card and LankaQR based payments for an affordable cost without compromising security and reliability. The firm also offered customised solutions for larger corporates to provide them with front-end applications to conveniently process transactions.
The brand was also recognised as the island-wide winner of the ‘Best Disruptor 2021’ and was awarded the prestigious ‘Best Disruptor – Western Province’ along with ‘Best Innovation in Business Management’ at the SLASSCOM National Ingenuity Awards 2021 held recently.
Chief Operating Officer Sasindu Pathiranage talking of the next chapter of growth for DirectPay said: “The emergence of COVID-19 has, disrupted the way money is transferred and how payments are made. We believe that cashless payment systems can now stimulate economic growth by making payments easier and convenient, provide time and cost savings opportunities for businesses, reduce manual reconciliation, counting and cash handling, as well as reducing the governmental cost of issuing hard cash. Essentially, anyone with a smartphone can make cross-border payments and purchases inexpensively and efficiently.”
As such, DirectPay over the next one year will be concentrating their effort on designing solutions around cardless checkout on e-commerce websites and Tap & Pay feature for retail payments, as well micro credit based on credit scores. They will also provide an omni channel to the merchants, enabling them to accept e-commerce payments via cards, wallets, LankaQR or any other retail payments through a smart all in one Mobile POS device. 
Motivated by its ambition to bring about positive change and driven by its passion for nurturing the digital payments ecosystem of Sri Lanka, DirectPay is geared, now more than ever, to bring about the next wave of innovation in cashless payments.

No central bank can keep low interest rates and defend the exchange rate at the same time without allowing for capital outflows in terms of the ‘Impossible Trinity’
 

It was with some amusement that I read the article titled ‘Interest rate policy: Is it a punitive measure?’ written by Chandrasena Maliyadde, which appeared in Daily FT last week (http://www.ft.lk/columns/Interest-rate-policy-Is-it-a-punitive-measure/4-717719). It is a critique of my article ‘Low interest rate policy punishes savers’ published in this column on 25 March (http://www.ft.lk/columns/Low-interest-rate-policy-punishes-savers/4-715286).
While welcoming the criticism, I am compelled to mention here that his article contains nothing but numerous sarcastic and sweeping statements without any theoretical or empirical foundations which are essential features of any sensible economic analysis. 
The writer has not presented a single fact or a figure to prove his viewpoints, which seems to be his usual writing style despite being Secretary to three Ministries before retirement. His article contains many factual errors and inconsistencies as well. 
Nevertheless, I must thank him for prompting me to elaborate my arguments on the critical issues of interest rates and savings once again in this column, and to dispel his misconceptions. 

Mercy towards the poor?
In his article Maliyadde states, “I read with a lot of interest the article on ‘Low-interest rate policy punishes savers’ by our good friend Prof. Sirimevan Colombage. He has shown a great deal of mercy towards the poor and ageing community. I wonder whether ageing has disturbed his brilliant thought pattern. He talks more of spiritual aspects of life (mercy and thriftiness) rather than the discipline of materialistic economics (greed and investment) that he mastered throughout his career as a central banker, an academic and a researcher.”
In response to his statement, I would like to point out that I never expressed any views in my article on “spiritual aspects of life (mercy and thriftiness)”. 
It was purely a theoretical and data-based presentation that highlighted how the Central Bank’s low interest rate policy has adversely affected savers by offering them near-zero real interest rates while failing to stimulate commercial bank credit to the private sector so as to revive the COVID-19 pandemic-hit economic activities, as expected by the authorities.  Instead, the Government and public corporations have been able to borrow heavily from banks at low cost, taking advantage of low interest rates and easy money policy. This has resulted in an increase in the money supply by 22% during the last 12 months, causing enormous damage to macroeconomic stability. 

Neglect of macroeconomic implications
Maliyadde has completely neglected the macroeconomic implications of the excessive money supply growth in the recent past fuelled by unprecedented Government borrowings along with low interest rates. 
Besides, no central bank can keep low interest rates and defend the exchange rate at the same time without allowing for capital outflows in terms of the ‘Impossible Trinity,’ as I reiterated in this column. These are the points that Maliyadde missed in his write-up. I concluded my article by emphasising that fiscal and monetary policies need to be reformulated within a cohesive macroeconomic framework aiming at sustained economic stability without resorting to fixed interest and exchange rates.
Ignoring such broader insights contained in my article, Maliyadde laments that I have shown mercy towards the poor and ageing community.

Article based on positive economics 
I have been cautious throughout my career to base my research work strictly on ‘Positive Economics,’ as taught by my guru, the late Prof. H.A.de S. Gunasekera at Peradeniya University. 
Statements can be classified into positive statements and normative statements. Positive statements concern “what is, was or will be”, and normative statements concern “what ought to be”. 
Positive statements are based on theories, hypotheses, data, models, empirical tests and simulations. In contrast, normative statements are drawn from one’s philosophical, cultural, ethical and religious positions. They depend upon one’s judgement about what is good and what is bad. In other words, normative statements depend on “value judgements”. 
Disagreements over positive studies can be tested, proved or disproved by using statistical tests whereas disagreements over normative statements cannot be settled in such manner as different individuals have different ideas of what is good and bad. 
My article was based on positive economic foundations supported by Monetary Theory and quantitative data, and therefore, its findings can be accepted or rejected objectively by evaluating the given empirical evidence. 
Maliyadde, however, has not made any such attempt to assess whether the present low interest rate policy punishes savers, which is the core theme of my study. Instead, he has taken the easy path to present sarcastic narratives with lots of unrelated issues without focusing on the core subject matter.  
Hence, his article, based on his own value judgements, could be placed in the normative category, and, it cannot be evaluated by using any of the standard economic tools.  

Critic’s ignorance of welfare economics
Maliyadde states that he is wondering whether ageing has disturbed my thought pattern to shift to spiritual aspects of life (mercy and thriftiness) from materialistic economics (greed and investment). This statement itself reflects how the weakness of his understanding of basic economics.
In my article, I explained how the Central Bank’s low interest rate policy has adversely affected savers, specifically those who are in the bottom of the income pyramid. Such issues relating to poverty and income distribution are well within the scope of Welfare Economics, which is a branch of economics that seeks to evaluate economic policies such as interest rate policy in terms of their effects on the wellbeing of the community. 
He thinks that talking about the plight of the poor is a spiritual matter. Besides, the writer has misinterpreted savings (which we learnt as a key macroeconomic variable during our undergraduate days) as a spiritual aspect of life vis-à-vis investment which he considers as a materialistic economic norm.

Taking U-turn to be an anti-liberalisation champion
Maliyadde, who served the ‘Yahapalana’ Government in the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, which launched the pro-liberal economic strategy for Sri Lanka, ‘Vision 2025’, has now taken a U-turn by pausing himself as an anti-liberalisation champion.
In his write-up, Maliyadde blames economic liberalisation for each and every ill in the society. His long list of liberalisation-led ills includes birth control, low fertility, poverty, income inequality, disintegrated families, regional disparities, rural-urban imbalance, multiple ministries, multiple lotteries, population ageing, low agricultural and industrial production, erosion of rural economy, imports (cosmetics, grapes, apples, jumping-fish textiles, liquor and cigarettes, expensive cars), shifting of girls from handloom to power-loom industry and boys from traditional to modernised agriculture, girls’ insecurity, child malnutrition, illicit drugs, private practice by doctors, abortions, curative medicine in place of primary healthcare and so on. 
It is not clear how those arbitrarily chosen items are relevant to the ‘low interest rate policy and savings’, which was the theme of my article fired by the critic. 
Some of the statements in the writer’s article make us confusing, and they are hardly relevant to the subject matter of my column – interest rate policy.  For example, he says, “Some health centres promote births during day time and abort births after dusk. Eliminating a birth has become more lucrative than saving a birth. The liberal economy offered two options; save a life and save money; eliminate life and make money. Liberal economists are economic doctors but not medical doctors.”

Shedding tears for savers?
Maliyadde states, “Liberal trade and liberal economy advocates expected or misbelieved that it would bring investment, revenue from tourism and exports and accelerate growth and generate more employment opportunities. But it has endowed us an import-dependent lagging economy with an army of dependents. It is not the fallout but it is the total result. They now shedding tears on the plight of savers to cover their failure.”
Instead of shedding tears as mentioned by the critic, I clearly pinpointed the causes of the failure of economic liberalisation policies in Sri Lanka in my article as follows:
“My understanding is that successive governments have faced multiple challenges in adopting the much-needed macroeconomic corrective measures such as containing the budget deficit and maintaining flexible interest and exchange rates over decades. The inability of the authorities to tackle such challenges has resulted in the failure to reap the benefits of economic liberalisation. Hence, the main reason for the failure to achieve economic success seems to be the authorities’ inability to tackle the policy constraints, rather than the weaknesses of the orthodox recipe [economic liberalisation] per se.”

Populist policies
Critics of economic liberalisation deliberately neglect the fact that Sri Lanka’s economic stagnation is caused by factors such as policy failures, institutional weaknesses and political instability, rather than liberalisation.  Specifically, the populist economic policies adopted by the successive Governments in the annual Budgets to please the voters to win elections have had detrimental effects on economic efficiency and growth.  Opponents ignore these political economy factors and continue to blame economic liberalisation for the country’s economic downfall.

Low investment efficiency
More importantly, the country’s investment efficiency has deteriorated considerably over decades due to technology and innovation backwardness and less-productive public investment on major infrastructure projects, as discussed in my FT column appeared last week (http://www.ft.lk/columns/Investment-efficiency-crucial-for-post-pandemic-economic-recovery/4-717652). 
The widely-publicised corruption involved in the selection and implementation of such projects further weakens investment efficiency.  The writer completely ignores those policy and implementation-related weaknesses, and blames economic liberalisation for the calamity.

Praising pre-1977 economic policies
While brutally criticising the post-1977 economic liberalisation policies, Maliyadde has taken extra care to praise the pre-1977 inward-looking policies displaying his new-found love with import controls, protective domestic industries and subsistence agriculture, 
He says, “The economic system that prevailed before the introduction of a liberal economy, whatever you named it, was inclusive and catered to all segments of the population. The family was a single integrated unit. But liberalisation disintegrated the family and divided as women, youths and children. Widening income inequality created poverty. The widening gap created regional and rural/urban imbalance.” 
In contrast, many country studies conducted since the 1970s provide ample empirical evidence against import substitution policies (promoting industrialisation by import controls) in favour of outward-oriented policies (trade liberalisation accompanied with free movement of capital, labour, technology and enterprises). The most prominent among them is the study series conducted by the US National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) under the direction of Anne Krueger and Jagdish Bhagwati in 1978. 

Can’t the poor afford to save?
Maliyadde states, “Colombage laments that the low-interest rate has punished poor savers by offering low yields for their lifetime savings. Who are these poor savers? Can the poor afford to save? There are poor debtors and rich savers in society. A high-interest rate would offer a higher income to rich savers and high prices to poor savers, widening the already existing income inequality, which is another achievement of the liberal economy.” According to Maliyadde, poor people never save, and they only borrow. Rich people are the only savers, according to him. Hence, the low interest rate policy helps the poor to borrow at low cost, and it has no adverse impact on them since they do not save. The rich are the ones adversely affected by low interest rates, asserts the writer. 

Saving by the poor through microfinance 
Maliyadde, who excelled in public service for a long time, has to do some reading in microfinance at least now to see the success stories of savings by the poor in developing countries and how millions of them crossed the poverty line by managing their low incomes, specifically in Bangladesh. 
Based on their field studies conducted in Bangladesh, India and South Africa using “financial diaries”, Daryl Collins, Jonathan Morduch, Stuart Rutherford and Orland Ruthven, in their book ‘Portfolios of the Poor: How the World’s Poor Live on $ 2 a Day’ (2009) elaborate how the poor manage to save a part of their little income, and gradually improve their livelihood using innovative financial instruments.  Those findings contrast with the general belief that with incomes at impossibly low levels, the poor can do little for themselves beyond hand-to-mouth survival, as assumed by Maliyadde.
Collins et al. state, “Given this gap in our knowledge and our own accumulating questions, several years ago we launched a series of detailed, yearlong studies to shed light on how families live on so little. Some of the studies followed villagers in agricultural communities; others centred on city-dwellers. The first finding was the most fundamental: no matter where we looked, we found that most of the households, even those living on less than one dollar a day per person, rarely consume every penny of income as soon as it is earned. They seek, instead, to ‘manage’ their money by saving when they can and borrowing when they need to. They don’t always succeed, but over time, even for the poorest households, a surprisingly large proportion of income gets managed in this way—diverted into savings or used to pay down loans.”

Sri Lanka’s experience in saving by the poor
Several field studies led by me at the Open University of Sri Lanka in collaboration with the University of California (US), University of Manchester (UK) and University of Lund (Sweden) in the recent past reveal how the poor are empowered through microfinance in remote areas in Sri Lanka by providing them greater access to finance with different savings and lending instruments. Group-based system in microfinance has helped many poor people, particularly women, in rural areas to inculcate their savings habits and to obtain cost-effective borrowing to expand their income-generating activities, though still there are various limitations and weaknesses in the sector that need to be addressed by policymakers, according to our findings.
Given the island-wide proliferation of mobile phone systems in recent times, there is greater potential to promote mobile banking technology to enhance financial inclusion in Sri Lanka, as in the case of Kenya.

Lotteries are state-sponsored gambling
I cannot understand why Maliyadde dragged lotteries into his discussion. Claiming credit for his initiative in developing lottery business in Sri Lanka, Maliyadde says, “Today, we have ended up with two main lotteries, National Lottery and Development Lottery (incidentally, I am responsible for promoting the latter).”
These lotteries are nothing but State-sponsored gambling which have promoted betting addiction in the society, particularly among low-income households, causing detrimental effects on their livelihoods. 

Contradictory ending
Ironically, Chandasena Maliyadde, who agitates against economic liberalisation, ended up his article with a quotation from some official in the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond in the United States, perhaps the most liberalised economy in the world. To save space, it would be sufficient to mention here that the quotation has no relevance to a developing country like Sri Lanka.

Capital market regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) yesterday formally hailed the debut trading of the first SME-centric Empower Board firm Chrissworld Ltd.
To signify the historic development, Chrissworld Ltd. rang the market opening bell yesterday to commence trading on the CSE. Incidentally this took place via the first ever fully virtual market opening ceremony as well.
The listing follows a successful Initial Public Offering (IPO) held on 27 April. 
The IPO involving 7.5 million shares (25% stake) at Rs. 7.50 each (to raise Rs. 56.25 million) was oversubscribed by two times on its official opening day itself.
SEC Chairman Viraj Dayaratne PC speaking at the event said: “Ability to raise capital is very important for the success of a company and Start-ups and SMEs have found this to be the most difficult task. We at the SEC and the CSE realised that it was necessary for us to give them, this much needed support. That is why the Empower Board was created to enable SMEs to list on the CSE.” 
Congratulating Chrissworld for taking the initiative, Dayaratne said the Company has given leadership to all the SMEs and startups to make use of the host of benefits that are available via the Empower Board. 
“I would like to call upon all entrepreneurs in the country to make use of this opportunity. We have made it easy for companies to list on the Dirisavi Board and the Main Board. Processes have been streamlined and listings are now handled solely by the CSE in order to make it more efficient and less cumbersome. So it is our endeavour to ensure that businesses find the right environment and the facilities to develop their businesses,” the SEC Chairman added. 
CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando also congratulated Chrissworld on achieving the milestone of a public listing and being a pioneer in drawing more companies to the Empower Board. 
“This listing is a milestone for CSE as well as for Chrissworld Limited. We launched the Empower Board, another Board for listing on the CSE several years ago. The Empower Board was specifically tailored for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to list on the CSE,” Fernando said. 
He described SMEs as the bedrock of the economy and predominant majority of the number of companies in the country, employing almost half of the staff working in the corporate world. 
“The SMEs are the growth engines of our economy.  The ability to provide another avenue for them to seek growth capital, raise their corporate profile and establish better governance processes are all part of the objectives of the Empower Board. We are honoured that Chrissworld Limited, a strong logistics company that is profitable with a 10 year track record behind it to support, is going to be the first listing on the Empower Board,” Fernando added.
Chrissworld Chairman Christo Perera shared insight on the company’s perspective. “We had a successful conclusion of our IPO with a decent oversubscription. I wish to thank all the investors for the confidence, trust and the belief that you have had with Chrissworld Limited and our team. As an SME, we are thankful that we have been given the opportunity to list and go public.  “It is an opportunity we should not miss. We are happy that we were able to get funds from the public and use them for the development and the progress of the company. We have many plans for the growth of the company. We feel that logistics industry is a high potential industry and wish to harness the same potential”
The managers to the Chrissworld IPO and sponsor Atarah Capital Partners Managing Director Rohan Senewiratne said: “The SEC and CSE have done a great job to bring about the Empower Board. In the history of 100 years of Capital Market in Sri Lanka, we haven’t had a platform to list a SME and now we do. We congratulate Chrissworld Limited for getting there as the first company to be listed on the Empower board.”

The culmination of personal growth for any individual is having one’s own home. While it is a huge indication of accomplishment, it is certainly a challenge to purchase a home through savings alone. DFCC Bank has recognised this societal need and in response, the Bank for Everyone has launched a new home loan campaign to fulfil the dream of having a home of their own.
Launched under the creative line, ‘Let’s go home…to a home of our own with a DFCC Home Loan’, this campaign seeks to drive across a message that enables individuals to understand that there is no better feeling than going home, and if that home is your very own, the feeling is priceless. The bank is promoting this new Home Loan campaign extensively on social media and other digital media platforms. Regardless of whether one’s goal is to build, purchase or renovate a home or apartment, DFCC Home Loans can make that goal a reality. With hassle-free credit approvals in three working days and the lowest interest rates coupled with a repayment period up to 20 years, any individual with a minimum monthly income of Rs. 30,000 and above is eligible to apply for a DFCC Home Loan. The maximum loan amount will be determined by DFCC Bank upon consideration of the repayment capacity and the Forced Sale Value (FSV) of the property. In the case of a construction of a home, DFCC Bank allows a maximum borrowing up-to 75% of the value of the Bill of Quantity (BOQ). Customers can also choose between either an equated monthly instalment payment (where capital plus interest is a fixed sum) or equal monthly instalment payment (where capital is paid back in equal instalments with interest on a reducing balance).
Interested customers are encouraged to apply for a DFCC Home Loan by visiting any of the 139 branches spread across the country or by applying online through the DFCC Bank website. As an added convenience, DFCC Bank also offers a Home Loan at your doorstep service where a representative from the Bank will visit a location mentioned by the customer. As a bank which truly understands the needs of its Sri Lankan customers, DFCC Bank’s Home Loan product allows individuals to fill the empty space in their life with a priceless home to call their own.

PMsquare SL Managing Director Kaveenga Wijayasekara




The Association for Financial Professionals (AFP) and PMsquare have announced a formal partnership to offer exam preparation courses for finance professionals based in Sri Lanka. The courses will equip financial professionals with the tools they need to earn the Certified Corporate Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A) Professional (FPAC) certification, sponsored by AFP.
By partnering together, AFP and PMsquare are providing finance professionals in Sri Lanka with an opportunity to achieve their career goals. Each student will have access to the online preparation program, plus a blended learning experience with PMsquare local instructors.
“This partnership with PMsquare helps to further achieve AFP’s goal of better serving finance professionals in the Asia-Pacific region,” said APAC Managing Director Himashi Soriano. “AFP understands the importance of grooming leaders and specialists in this area, and as digital transformation shapes the future of finance, those that hold the FP&A certification will be leading the way. This training solution will support practitioners throughout Sri Lanka to establish themselves as leaders in the FP&A field and gain even more skills as they prepare for the exam.” 
The FPAC credential establishes a set of core competencies for the corporate FP&A profession and addresses areas that are not necessarily covered by traditional accounting degrees. It is the only credential that is specific to FP&A; it is forward-looking and assesses the ability to see the big picture. Certified FP&A professionals are specially equipped to mitigate uncertainty and see beyond the numbers; they strive to make the numbers work to determine holistic strategic planning, budgeting, and forecasting that ties into the goals of the business.
“The FP&A function is critical for successfully charting the future of any organisation. Companies in leading economies have defined and dedicated FP&A roles,” said PMsquare Sri Lanka Managing Director Kaveenga Wijayasekara. “Sri Lankan organisations too will benefit vastly with qualified FP&A teams. PMsquare is honoured to partner with AFP to offer this globally recognised qualification in Sri Lanka.”
Course participants will have access to AFP’s comprehensive online training platform. This platform is supplemented with instructor led sessions by PMsquare consultants where participants will gain practical experience on leading FP&A technologies and advanced financial modelling, predictive modelling, data management and business communication skills.
The AFP and PMsquare have organised an information session on the FPAC Certification, organised by the AFP at 12:30 p.m. on Thursday 20 May.

MBSL Chairman Kanchana Ratwatte


 





MBSL CEO (Actg) Jude Gamalath




The Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and Finance PLC (MBSL) announced yesterday it has made a strong turnaround by posting a profit during one of the worst-affected periods in recent history demonstrating its ability and resilience to overcome obstacles. 
In a statement MBSL said the company faced many challenges in the first quarter of the year as well as in the months leading to it, but it has managed to turn the situation around to post a profit.
The pre-tax profit growth was 296%, up from pre-tax loss growth of 116% in the first quarter of 2020. Such profits are a direct result of the institution-wide changes that have been put in place to deal with the pandemic. The Net Interest Income increased 70% to Rs. 718 million from Rs. 422 million, in the first quarter of 2020. 
According to MBSL Chairman Kanchana Ratwatte the company has consistently proven resilient in the face of hardships. 
We have always prided ourselves on our ability to stay flexible and agile. Our ability to move with the times, our team’s sense of loyalty, and our commitment to excellence in any situation has helped us effectively to navigate through these difficult times and come out stronger. The company is turning around with renewed vigour, more focus and new strategies. We are very optimistic about our future,” Ratwatte added.
The growth in gross earnings was a result of increase in equity related activities and real estate income. The company’s customers’ loyalty was proven with an increase of deposits by 5% to Rs. 22.8 billion from Rs. 21.7 billion. Net fee and commission income increased by 33% as a result of improved business volumes. The company was able to curtail the operating cost by around 1% year on year with strict management of the costs.
The pandemic affected the overall numbers at MBSL but did not hesitate to implement all relief measures introduced in line with the government policies to cushion the impact of the pandemic on customers to assist improving their cash flows. 
MBSL Acting CEO Jude Gamalath said: “It was due to our utmost commitment to customer relationships that strengthened the trust they have in us, strong focus on key business areas, and the 100% dedication of our staff and management that we were able to post profits in one of the country’s worst periods in recent times. Such factors allowed us to create a quick turnaround in Q1 2021. We are happy that we have been able to do this and look forward to continued success in the future.”
MBSL entered the Sri Lankan financial sector as the country’s pioneer merchant bank in 1982 and was quoted on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1991. Subsequently registered as a licensed finance company under the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011 under the regulatory purview of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Softlogic Life Chief Operating Officer Indu Attygala

 




With the pandemic evolving aggressively each day and grave social and economic repercussions in Sri Lanka, the country’s fastest growing life insurer Softlogic Life continues to pour their undivided attention and resources into ensuring the wellbeing and safety of their policy holders and families. 
Right from the beginning of the first island-wide lockdown last March, the company has strived hard to innovate and enhance their portfolio to better support their clients with a number of powerful, island-first initiatives – from online premium payments to generous premium payment relief solutions for policy holders. 
“Softlogic Life has always been powered by the innate strength of the Sri Lankan spirit and has always strived hard to protect and empower this spirit,” said Softlogic Life Chief Operating Officer Indu Attygala. “The unprecedented global climate of today has taken a heavy toll on life in the country. At no point in time, did we anticipate that a single health pandemic would so significantly shift our focus as a society and leave us assessing where we all fit in this ‘new normal’. 
“Starting from the first lockdown, our policy holders were looking to us for reliability, support, empathy and real value. Therefore, we paid close consideration to customer needs that overnight had changed drastically and invested in solutions that brought great support and ease to their lives.” 
Affirming their long-standing commitment to enhancing the quality of life of all Sri Lankans, Softlogic Life went above and beyond to roll out a series of initiatives to bring ease and comfort to its customers. Among these financial relief measures, policy holders were offered incomparable premium payment relief options according to their individual income and earning capacity, a unique, company-specific solution. Policy holders were also allowed to continue their policies without lapse even with unpaid premiums, allowing customers to enjoy the safety of their policy at such a critical juncture. 
Additionally, the 90-day waiting period applicable in policy re-instatements was also waived off, enabling customers to process non-accidental claims immediately after completing their pending premium payments, an initiative that has brought immense respite during the tense global situation that required the support of personal life insurance. The leading life insurer has continued to proactive in ensuring operational resilience and fluidity to meet the rapidly progressing needs of customers and stakeholders.
“As a truly Sri Lankan and progressive brand, we will continue to add finesse and convenience to our customer experience as we push through these tough times together with deep empathy for one another,” Attygala added.
Disrupting the insurance landscape in Sri Lanka, Softlogic introduced the Instaclaim app, a claims management system for corporate clients that enabled employees to file, process and settle claims by themselves within just three days. This eliminated extra intervention by human resources departments, when company work models had to shift entirely to a work from home setting. 
Additionally, premium payments were payable by Softlogic Life’s LifeUp app and the company’s official web platform. By partnering with the largest supermarket chain in the country Cargills Food City, premium payment facilities were also made possible at supermarket counters at these outlets.
The dedicated and highly committed team of Softlogic Life’s PCU officers were also deployed during this time to journey to the doorsteps of customers to collect premium payments, eliminating their need to step outside of their homes during such a critical time. All customers were issued a receipt as proof of payment, inspiring confidence and comfort in this system. In parallel, PCU app access was given to the entire advisor base of Softlogic Life, in a double effort to enable premium payments when certain PCU officers weren’t allowed to move through regions due to lockdown.
With the rapid global shift into a new normal which accelerated the move towards a seamlessly connected, digitally mediated world of work, education and social interaction, Softlogic Life was among the first organisations to introduce a frictionless service experience across the board through apps, integrations and digital ecosystems which required less paperwork, product pushing and physical interaction. The company’s strategically developed advisor platform is completely secure and allows all customer interactions to take place in a completely digital environment. 
Further, using a multi-channel approach, Softlogic Life has innovated various powerful platforms to reach clients across the consumer pyramid, in particular the bottom, through numerous affordable insurance options, which proved to be invaluable contributions during the COVID economic crunch deeply impacting their income sources.

Strong CASA growth, improved NPA enables resilient Q1 performance 
Fully geared to support economic and businesses revival efforts 
Urges authorities to make vaccinations available to all, especially frontline bank staff 
Requests public to stay calm and act responsibly and compassionately to each other








HNB Acting Chairman Dr. Harsha Cabral PC


 





HNB Managing Director and CEO Jonathan Alles




HNB has recorded a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 4.7 billion during the first quarter of 2021 while Profit Before Income Tax (PBT) amounted to Rs. 5.5 billion. At the group level, PBT and PAT were at Rs. 5.9 billion and Rs. 4.8 billion, respectively. 
The substantial monetary loosening adopted to revive the pandemic-hit economy resulted in AWPLR dropping by nearly 400 bps over the past 12 months. This resulted in the interest income decreasing by 13% YoY to Rs. 23.7 billion. Interest expenses, too, exhibited a decline of 17.2% YoY to Rs. 13.1 billion, driven by strong CASA (current accounts and savings accounts) mobilisation. The CASA ratio improved from 36.2% in March 2020 to 39.7% by the end of Q1 2021 as the CASA base grew by 30% YoY to Rs. 395 billion. As a result, the bank’s Net Interest Income (NII) for the first three months 2021 decreased by 7.2% YoY to Rs. 10.6 billion.
Commenting on the bank’s results Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles stated: “HNB has demonstrated resilience, strength and stability during a year of unprecedented disruption. We are grateful for the complete trust and support of our customers, investors and other stakeholders throughout this time. 
“I also wish to place on record my deepest appreciation for the unwavering dedication of our staff in continuing to serve our clientele through multiple waves of the pandemic, despite the inherent risks involved. Our top priority during this time was to ensure their safety while supporting customers affected by the pandemic.”
He added: “We provided moratoria under three phases while granting working capital finance out of CBSL schemes and our own funds. In addition to the financial assistance provided during the last year, we enhanced our digital proposition to ensure that customers could securely and reliably access all of our services while staying safe from the pandemic. 
“This included introducing many new features on SOLO – our digital payment platform, and the launch of our new digital banking app and e-commerce capabilities for SME clients among many others. We are currently in the process of further refining these powerful new services, which will undoubtedly provide greater convenience for all HNB customers in the future.” 
Net Fee and Commission income for the first quarter grew by 10.2% YoY to Rs. 2.3 billion as business activity rebounded during the period. The Credit Cards business, Trade and Remittances, which constitute a major share of fees, performed well despite restrictions on imports continuing to be in place. Other fee sources, which also encompass digital business lines rose by 24.4% YoY. 
Exchange rate volatility and movements during the period led to substantial revaluation gains on swaps and forward agreements. Swap costs were also lower relative to the corresponding quarter of 2020 as swap premiums declined in line with dollar interest rates. Accordingly, the bank recorded a net exchange gain of Rs. 1.9 billion which was a 53% YoY improvement compared to Q1 2020. The total dividend income from investments for Q1 2021 was Rs. 421 million compared to Rs. 13 million in the corresponding period of 2020, as dividends declared for the financial year 2019 were paid only in Q2 2020 due to the pandemic. 
The NPA ratio of the bank improved marginally to 4.28% as at end of Q1 2021 compared to 4.31% as at end-December 2020, as majority of customers who were previously under moratorium commenced repayments since October 2020. The impairment charge for the quarter ended 31 March 2021 was Rs. 2.7 billion in comparison to Rs. 4.7 billion recorded for Q1 2020. The impairment for Q1 2020 included a charge of Rs. 708 million on account of sovereign bonds mainly as a result of the sovereign downgrade that was effected in April 2020. 
“More than a year after the pandemic, it is unfortunate that we are now seeing the most severe rise in COVID-19 cases to date. All of the lessons that we have learned over the past year will be put to the test. While progress has been made in terms of vaccinations, the economic impact of this latest wave of COVID-19 infections will hinge on how effectively we as a nation are able to rally together to control the spread of the virus,” Alles stated.
“In this crucial moment, as a responsible domestic systemically important bank, as always, we will continue to support our valued customers and play a meaningful role as an essential service provider. We have already enabled all our digital channels, and are also fully geared to support business revival and help rebuild our nation. 
“We request the public to remain calm, adhering to all health and safety guidelines provided and to act with responsibility and compassion towards one another. We also urge the authorities to expand the vaccination program and in particular seek their support to make vaccination a priority for front line and critical staff across the banking industry.” 
The zealous focus on cost optimisation facilitated a marginal 1% YoY dip in Operating costs to Rs. 5.8 billion. Cost to Income was hence improved by a commendable 170 bps relative to the comparative period in 2020 to 38% for Q1 2021. 
Profit Before Taxes (PBT) amounted to Rs. 5.5 billion and was subjected to the reduced income tax charge of 24% in comparison to the 28% tax charge that was applicable previously. Accordingly, the Profit After Tax for the bank improved to Rs. 4.7 billion by 78% during Q1 2021. 
The bank’s assets crossed Rs. 1.3 trillion as at quarter-end with the gross loan book at Rs. 808.3 billion. Total deposits grew to Rs. 996.1 billion, recording an impressive Rs. 155 billion growth (18.4% YoY) over the 12-month period since March 2020. 
As one of the best-capitalised banks in the industry, the bank reported Tier I and Total Capital Adequacy Ratios of 14.82% and 17.88%, respectively. Similarly, HNB’s liquidity levels continued to be strong and well-ahead of regulatory minimum requirements with Statutory Liquid Asset and all currency Liquidity Coverage ratios at 39.98% (against a 20% requirement) and 271.79% (against a 100% requirement), respectively. 
HNB Group recorded a PBT of Rs. 5.9 billion and a PAT of Rs. 4.8 billion for the quarter ended March 2021, recording a growth of 35.7% YoY and 46.7% YoY, respectively. Total assets of the group increased to Rs. 1,388 billion as at 31 March 2021. 
HNB is among the Top 1000 Banks in the world as per the prestigious Banker Magazine UK and is rated AA- (lka) by Fitch Ratings. The bank is an 11-time winner of the Best Retail Bank award bestowed by the Asian Banker Magazine and was recently recognised among the top 10 most admired corporates for the third consecutive year at the ‘Most Admired Corporates of Sri Lanka’ awards organised by CIMA, ICCSL and Daily FT.

Owing to its advance growth well supported by a healthy financing margin of 3.7%, the bank’s Net Financing Income grew by 10% YOY to close the quarter at Rs. 892.0 million. Net Operating Income after accounting for impairment closed at Rs. 934.2 million.

London, (Reuters): Alphabet Inc.’s Google has launched international money transfer partnerships with remittances firms Wise and Western Union Co. for users of its US payments app, the companies said on Tuesday.
Google Pay users in the United States can now transfer money to app customers in India and Singapore, with plans to expand to the 80 countries available via Wise, and 200 via Western Union by the end of the year.
Google’s foray in the $ 470 billion remittance market, marks a further step by the technology company to expand its financial services offering, ramping up competition in the digital payments sector.
London-based Wise was launched in 2011 with the aim of making international money transfers cheaper and easier, while Western Union remains a market leader in remittances, with a sprawling global network of physical locations.
Their partnership with Google Pay, which has 150 million users in 40 countries, comes as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a boom in online payments, but an estimated drop in overall remittances flows. The money migrant workers sent home is projected to have declined 14% from 2019 due to worsening economic conditions and employment levels in migrant-hosting countries, according to the latest estimates from the World Bank.
“Even with COVID a lot of people have relocated around the world and we wanted to focus on how we can help facilitate these payments,” said Josh Woodward, director of product management at Google. “Our goal for this year is to work with Wise and Western Union to roll this out for the countries they support.” The Silicon Valley technology company redesigned its US payments app in November, introducing paid promotions to the service and opening a waitlist for bank accounts being launched next with several lenders.
The new remittances functionality escalates competition among technology companies and traditional finance firms over consumers’ money and data, with providers looking to become a one-stop shop for their users’ financial needs.
Ant Group, Samsung Electronics Co., Apple Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc also offer mobile wallets aiming to be hubs for services ranging from crossborder payments to credit.

Sampath Bank PLC recently entered into a strategic partnership with SDB Bank whereby customers of SDB can gain access to Sampath Bank’s branch network and cash/cheque deposit kiosks, enabling greater convenience and accessibility to new services, thereby driving greater financial inclusion. 
This partnership goes on to showcase how the convergence of a licenced specialised bank and a licenced commercial bank can create synergies, in line with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Government’s vision of consolidation within the banking industry.
The agreement, signed at the Sampath Bank Head Office in Colombo, seeks to develop a long-term partnership between both banks and their customers with Sampath Bank playing the role of a secondary participant to SDB Bank for SLIPS and CEFTS Settlements as the first phase of the Cash Management Solution (CMS). 
As a truly progressive financial institution, Sampath Bank has always sought to form key alliances that deliver value to Sri Lankans across the island and will seek to replicate this model across several industries and verticals. This forms the backbone of the Bank’s long-term vision for its Cash Management function, whereby optimisation of processes will be driven, leading to gains to its bottom line. 
The key merits of this partnership are that SDB Bank customers will now have access to Sampath Bank’s branch network comprising 228 branches including 13 Super Branches, 465 cash deposit kiosks, allowing them to carry out specific banking services such as cash/cheque depositing and loan repayments, among others. SDB Bank will benefit by being able to offer its customers an entirely new portfolio of modern banking products and services, thus creating greater customer satisfaction and loyalty, while Sampath Bank will be able to reach hitherto untapped customer markets, helping businesses and individuals in those areas to grow. 
Speaking about the partnership Sampath Bank PLC Head of Deposit Mobilisation Halin Hettigoda said, “We are very proud to enter into this historic agreement with SDB Bank and congratulate them on the bold steps taken to create powerful operational synergies and an enhanced value proposition for their customers. Furthermore, the fact that they were so willing to partner with us, despite Sampath Bank being a larger operator, speaks volumes to the trust and confidence they have in us and the strength of our relationship.”
SDB Bank CEO Thilak Piyadigama said, “This extension of our long-standing relationship with Sampath Bank will offer several benefits to our customers including centralisation and improved management of payments and collections together with improving returns on liquidity. We are very excited about the potential of this innovative solution which will allow us to take that next step of delivering higher value services to all customer segments while streamlining our processes for the convenience of our employees.”

This is expected to help customers around the island manage their cashflow more efficiently, reduce processing costs, save time and mitigate risk, thereby allowing business owners and managers to concentrate their efforts and resources on building core competencies and growing the business. 
Sampath Bank is a 100% local bank that has deeply rooted itself in the hearts of the people of Sri Lanka. Established in 1987, the bank has become a state-of-the-art financial institution that continues to be a market leader today thanks to its constant innovation and customer focused approach to business. It has introduced many firsts to the Sri Lankan banking sector including the introduction of ATMs to Sri Lanka, extended banking hours and slip-less banking to name a few. The Bank continues to steadily transform itself into a technology-driven financial services provider whilst keeping true to local traditions and values.

Ups post-tax profitability by 34%
Enhanced fund and non-fund based income, cost management and digital strategies propel profits 
Deposits base touches Rs. 500 b
Cost to income ratio significantly improves to 30.9%
Profit before all taxes increases by 19% to Rs. 3.5 b
Post-tax profitability increases by impressive 34% to Rs. 2.3 b








NDB Chairman Eshana De Silva


 





NDB Director Group CEO Dimantha Seneviratne




National Development Bank PLC, the reigning winner of The Best Bank in Sri Lanka 2021 of Global Finance USA and The bank of the Year 2020 of The banker UK, has achieved sustained results for the first quarter ended 31 March 2021, amidst challenging conditions. 
Commenting on this performance, NDB Director/Group Chief Executive Officer Dimantha Seneviratne noted that the period was marked by two fundamental changes, one – the prospect of prolonged low interest rates, and the other – greater inclination towards digital engagements from our customers. 
“NDB strategised in response to these changes well, which ensured continued support to our customers as well as preserved returns to our shareholders. The NDB Group’s new strategic plan, which was launched in October 2020, has placed us on a steadfast growth trajectory amidst the turbulences. We carry good momentum to the second half of the year, which seems steeper in terms of challenges, with the outbreak of the third wave of the pandemic in Sri Lanka and worsening situations across Asia, which will have a cascading impact on the local economy. The bank will fully deploy prudent and timely strategic initiatives in response to the pandemic, the development and impact of which is yet to be fully gauged,” he noted. 

Income and profitability 
The bank’s total operating income posted a growth of 23% to Rs. 8.2 billion, supported by enhanced net interest income (NII), fee income and other non-fund income bases. Although interest income dipped by 8% due to lower interest rates, this was more than offset by a larger dip in interest expenses of 20% leading to an NII growth of 18% to Rs. 5.1 billion. This also led to a broadly stabilised net interest margin of 3.29% compared to 3.07% of 2020. Driving NIMs was the CASA base of Rs. 129 billion in Q1 2021 growing impressively by 58% over Q1 2020 (quantum of growth – Rs. 47 billion), which also raised the CASA ratio from 20% to 26%. Fee and commission income recorded a healthy growth of 29% to Rs. 1.3 billion due to larger credit volumes across all segments and increased transactions routed through NDB NEOS digital platforms. Net gains and trading also posted a record increase of 116% over Q1 2020 to Rs. 460 million, reflecting the forex income gained during the quarter. 
Impairment charges for loans and other losses for Q1 2021 were Rs. 2.2 billion, an increase of 70% YoY. Provision charges increased in line with the growth in the loan book and provisions made at both collective and individual levels in response to elevated risks caused by the pandemic and other stresses. The regulatory gross non-performing loan [NPL] ratio for Q1 2021 was 5.40% (2020: 5.35%) reflecting the wider industry NPL behaviour. The net NPL ratio for the quarter was 2.96% (2020:3.23%). The bank is cognizant of further potential stresses on asset quality stemming from the third wave of the pandemic and has strengthened its risk management framework to mitigate and manage the impact. 
On total operating expenses, same was Rs. 2.5 billion for Q1 2021, a 4% increase over Q1 2020. Within this, the bank continued to manage a reduction in controllable expenses compared to Q1 2020 amidst considerable business growth and various initiatives carried out. The resultant cost to income ratio for the quarter was 30.9% — one of the best in the industry as well as amongst other corporates. This ratio has been on a significant improvement from a high of 49% in 2016, thanks to the increase in banking revenue in line with the bank’s strategic plans, coupled with conscious and concerted cost management initiatives and productivity enhancement measures, which include digitisation and automation.
Accordingly, operating profit before all taxes for the period was Rs. 3.5 billion, an increase of 19%. Total taxes for the period was Rs. 1.1 billion, comprising VAT on financial services and income tax, with income tax rate reducing to 24% from 28%. The resultant effective tax rate for Q1 2021 was 33%. 
Post-tax profitability enhanced to Rs. 2.3 billion, with solid growth of 34% whilst profit attributable to shareholders was Rs. 2.4 billion, up by an impressive 90%, complemented by improved performance of the NDB Group’s capital market cluster, making up the unique financial service powerhouse in Sri Lanka.

NDB sustained its thus far healthy balance sheet growth well into Q1 2021, wherein the total asset base grew by 2% to Rs. 636 billion over December 2020 (YTD). Though moderated, this is a YoY growth (i.e. over Q1 2020) of 15% and commendable in the prevailing subdued economic conditions. Balance sheet growth was propelled by the growth in the gross loan book to Rs. 462 billion, which was a YTD growth of 4% and YoY growth of 9%, quantum of growth being Rs. 18.6 billion and Rs. 37.5 billion, respectively. Loan growth was a reflection of both lending under the Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, where NDB was the fourth-highest bank to approve funds, and lending through the bank’s own funds, in support of reviving the country’s economy. Loan book growth stemmed from multiple segments, including SMEs and consumers, and across multiple sectors, preserving the dynamism of the bank’s loan book, which has enabled it to withstand external shocks.
On funding, the bank’s deposits base neared the Rs. 500 billion mark with deposits closing at Rs. 499.5 billion. This is a YTD growth of 2% and an impressive YoY growth of 21%, which translates to quantum of Rs. 9.2 billion and Rs. 85.3 billion, respectively. This is a considerable growth considering the contraction in commercial bank deposits rates by about 3% from March 2020 to March 2021 rendering them less attractive to surplus units. Within overall deposits, CASA deposits comprised 26%, up from 25% as of 31 Dec 2020. NDB’s long-standing relationships with customers together with customer-centric excellence in service have supported garnering deposits across all segments.

Capital infusion via Rights Issue and Private Placement 
NDB successfully concluded the Rights Issue announced in October 2020, where a total of 106,780,489 were offered at a ratio of 28 new ordinary voting shares for every 61 ordinary voting shares held, at a price of Rs. 75 per share. 83.2% of these shares will be allotted to existing shareholders with the balance 16.8% available to be offered to Norfund — the Norwegian Investment Fund for developing countries, who is expected to participate in the Rights Issues and a Private Placement, as per the Share Subscription Agreement and Investment Agreement entered in to with them, and as approved by the shareholders of the bank at the EGM held on 9 April. Accordingly, Rs. 8 billion will be raised through the Rights Issue. 
A further 17,705,927 shares at Rs. 82.50 per share, which is at a 10% premium on the Rights price, is to be issued to Norfund through the Private Placement. This will raise a further Rs. 1.46 billion, totalling Rs. 9.5 billion raised by NDB through the Rights Issue and the Private Placement in Tier I equity capital. This timely capital infusion will provide significant impetus in pursuing NDB’s strategic growth plans in the near and medium term, whilst making a valid contribution to the nation’s economic development and capitalising on emerging opportunities. 

Key performance ratios 
Return on equity of the bank for Q1 2021 enhanced to 15.79% (2020: 13.13%) whilst the same at the group level was 16.01% (2020: 11.20%). Pre-tax ROA of the bank was 1.62% (2020: 1.59%) and of the group was 1.76% (2020: 1.58%). Earnings per share of the bank was Rs. 30.98 (2020: Rs. 23.77), whilst the same for the group was Rs. 33.62 (2020: Rs. 21.99). The net asset value per share of the bank and the group were Rs. 199.81 and Rs. 213.73. 
In terms of capital adequacy, Tier I capital adequacy ratio and Total capital adequacy ratio of the bank were 9.00% and 13.74%, respectively. The same ratios for the group were 9.47% and 14.09%. Liquidity coverage ratio – rupee, liquidity coverage ratio – all currency and net stable funding ratio were 167.91%, 158.41% and 114.53%. All these ratios were well above the regulator stipulated minimum requirement levels, reflecting the strength, stability and sufficient liquidity of the bank. 

COVID-19 pandemic-related support to customers
The bank continues to offer its customers close financial and advisory support to expeditiously recover and remain resilient in the challenging conditions brought in by the pandemic. All CBSL-mandated relief measures are also duly extended to customers. 
NDB Jayagamu Sri Lanka, the dedicated proposition, continues to support, SMEs, inventors and exporters through customised financial solutions and professional support through a large number of partnerships the bank has entered into, for the benefit of customers. 
Commenting on this, the GCEO stated that the bank placed the interests of our customers affected by the pandemic at the centre of our efforts and our teams invested considerable time and effort in supporting them emerge resilient from its effects. 
“This is reflected in the percentage of our customers under moratoria out of the total loan book reducing significantly to 17% by March 2021 from 40% in the instance it was first introduced in 2020. We are encouraged by the fact that the majority of our moratoria customers have regained financial health and stability through the bank’s support and their own efforts and discipline in revival. 
“NDB continues to flex and reinvest its solutions in response to the unique needs of its customers. The bank’s strong digital platform – NDB NEOS comprising online banking and inter-operatable QR payments enabled NEOS App have enabled customers to carry out their banking with the safety of their own space,” he further stated. 

Contribution to the community
Success is a wider notion at NDB, which permeates beyond financial performance. In this spirit, the bank continued numerous other activities for the benefit of the community and the environment. Sri Lanka Vanithabhimana, the national level awards program with the aims of recognising high performing females across eight categories, and also encouraging women’s participation in the economy culminated in March 2021, with winners felicitated at an event that marked International Women’s Day. A Smart-Agri program was also launched with a bid to introduce smart agriculture techniques to farmers, which would improve productivity in farming and cultivations. The bank’s conscious contribution towards a greener planet continued through its reforestation project in Himbiliyakada, Matale, removal of invasive plants threatening the biodiversity of Pitawala Pathana – a protected environment, mangroves planting project in Puttlam and Mannar and numerous environmental awareness and education programs for target audiences. 
The foreseeable future seems laden with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. NDB remains committed to support its customers through these challenges and make an essential contribution towards national economic revival, whilst generating meaningful returns to its shareholders and other stakeholders. NDB is set to achieve a triple 500 billion in total assets, gross loans and customer deposits, with total deposits to soon cross this milestone. With this ambition brewing at the core, Team NDB is geared to perform and take NDB to greater heights.

Hong Kong, (AFP): Equity markets tumbled in Asia and Europe on Tuesday following steep losses on Wall Street as investors grow increasingly worried about a surge in inflation that could force central banks to wind back their ultra-loose monetary policies earlier than forecast.
All eyes are on the release this week of crucial data on US retail sales and consumer prices, with expectations for a sharp rise as the world’s top economy reopens and vaccines allow people to return to a sense of normality.
A massive miss on US jobs creation last week that indicated the recovery was not going to be as smooth as thought provided some relief from those fears, but a rally in commodities – particularly widely used copper and iron ore – has markets concerned that costs will spiral.
Signs that this is having an effect were seen in data from China that showed prices paid at the country’s factory gates rose last month at their fastest pace in almost four years.
Those worries continue to hover over trading floors, despite repeated assurances from the Federal Reserve that it will stick to its huge bond-buying and record-low interest rate position for as long as needed until it has unemployment tamed and inflation is running consistently hot.
While Fed bosses have said they see inflation coming in high for a few weeks owing to the low base of comparison from last year, a high reading would ramp up pressure on policymakers to make sure they do not let it get out of hand.
“Inflationary concerns will dominate the focus this week, but the base effects are widely priced in and this upcoming reading will likely only serve as a baseline,” said OANDA strategist Edward Moya.
And there is a feeling that the issue will dog markets for some time, even as investors are confident the global economy is well on the recovery path.
“We’re going to see volatility definitely over the next couple of months” given uncertainty over the path of growth, Kristen Bitterly, of Citi Private Bank, told Bloomberg TV.
Nervousness ahead of the US data sent traders rushing for the doors Monday. The Dow snapped a three-day streak of records and the S&P 500 lost more than one percent, while the Nasdaq shed 2.6% with tech firms considered vulnerable to higher borrowing costs owing to the potential effect on their future earnings and cash flow.
And Asia followed the lead, with tech firms at the forefront of the selling.
Tokyo and Taipei each dropped more than three percent, while Hong Kong was off two percent.
Sydney and Seoul retreated more than one percent, and there were also losses in Singapore, Wellington, Manila, Mumbai, Bangkok and Jakarta. Shanghai and Manila edged up however.
London dropped more than 2%, while Paris and Frankfurt all shed around 1.8% each in the morning.
“It will take a few more months for these base effects to wash through, and by then we’ll probably have a much better picture of where we are, and whether central bank confidence about transitory inflation is misplaced or not,” said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.

Mastercard New Payments Index reveals 94% of consumers in APAC are considering using emerging payment methods this year 


APAC enthusiasm for QR codes, digital wallets and cryptocurrencies exceeds global averages



As a result of the pandemic, enthusiasm for a broader range of payment technologies has accelerated in the Asia Pacific region as 94% of people say they will consider using at least one emerging payment method, such as QR codes, digital or mobile wallets, instalment plans, cryptocurrencies, biometrics and others, in the coming year. 
This is according to the Mastercard New Payments Index conducted across 18 markets globally, including India, Australia and Thailand, which reveals that 84% of consumers in APAC already have access to more ways to pay compared to one year ago. Of note for entrepreneurs, 74% of respondents said that they would shop at small businesses with greater frequency if they offered additional payment options. 
“Mastercard’s study finds that people in the Asia Pacific region haven’t just adopted new payment technologies—they’ve made deliberate shifts based partly on necessity, but also on considerations around personal safety, security and convenience, at a time when these concerns were paramount,” said Mastercard Executive Vice President, Products & Innovation, Asia Pacific Sandeep Malhotra. “Consumers in Asia Pacific have already gained recognition globally for their openness to new technologies and innovation, and these findings confirm that this trend is only set to continue as more digital payment options rapidly become mainstream in this part of the world.”
Looking ahead, the use of a range of payment technologies is trending upwards as people’s comfort with and understanding of them increases - while the use of cash steadily decreases. In fact, in the coming year, 69% of respondents in APAC say they plan to use cash less frequently (primarily due to concerns about hygiene and security). Meanwhile, digital or mobile wallets have gained significant popularity amongst consumers in APAC, with 68% of respondents anticipating using this type of payment in the next year – higher than the global average of 62%. 
“This behavior shift is reinforced by people’s desire for choice – with 85% of consumers in APAC saying that they expect to make purchases when they want and how they want. Businesses that can provide multiple ways to shop and pay will be best positioned to meet the unique needs of this moment that are shaping the future of commerce for years to come,” added Malhotra. 

Notably, the survey also revealed:
1. A new shopping reality and payment habits – 84% of consumers in APAC have seen their access to emerging forms of payments increase in the past year alone. While 88% used at least one emerging payment type in the last year, two-thirds (64%) of all respondents (including 75% of millennials) say they tried new payment methods that they would not have tried were it not for the pandemic. As consumer demand increases, businesses of all sizes will face greater expectations to provide multiple ways to purchase and pay: 80% of respondents now prefer to shop at stores that have both an in-person and online presence, and 69% are more excited to shop at retailers who offer the latest payment methods. In fact, 60% of consumers polled say they would avoid merchants that do not accept electronic payments of any kind.
2. Among various emerging payment methods: 


QR codes especially popular in APAC – QR codes have gained particularly strong traction in APAC compared to the rest of the world as 63% of respondents in this region said they used QR codes for payments more frequently in the last year than they had in the past, compared to 56% of respondents globally. In APAC 76% of respondents perceive QR codes to be cleaner (76%) and more convenient (71%) for in-person payments as it is likely consumers are using their own mobile device. In Thailand and India, 77% and 71% of consumers respectively perceive QR codes to be secure while only 10% and 16% respectively perceive cash as a secure form of payment, demonstrating people’s significantly greater trust in QR codes and other forms of digital payments.


Cryptocurrency gains ground, Millennials primed to jump in – Today consumers can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency as a commodity or investment. Consumers are also increasingly showing interest in being able to spend crypto assets for everyday purchases. 45% of those surveyed in APAC say they are likely to consider using cryptocurrency in the next year – a huge jump over the 12% that already used it in the last year, and noticeably higher than the global average of 40%. Millennials and centennials are relatively more comfortable using cryptocurrency (41%) compared to Gen X and Boomers (26%), with 71% of millennials saying they are more open to using it than they were a year ago. Geographically speaking, more Thais (46%) and Indians (44%) are comfortable using cryptocurrency than Australians (17%).


Consumers increasingly comfortable with biometrics – Perceptions of safety and convenience have been front and centre for people over the past year. 64% of consumers in APAC say they are excited about the potential of biometric verification methods like gait or walk assessments and fingerprint authorisation. In fact, 62% feel safer using biometrics to verify a purchase than entering a pin.


3. Security concerns top of mind – With one in four respondents in APAC (27%) reporting that they were victims of fraud in the last year, consumers need assurance; 79% indicated they would be open to trying new payment technologies if they perceived them to be safe, while 85% want to be sure the payment options the merchant offers are secure. As such, many consumers place trust in issuers and networks to provide tools that keep their financial information secure, with 45% agreeing that they would place their trust in their payment provider to follow security best practices, so they can be more hands-off. On the flip side, the top reasons given for not trying new payment methods include security concerns (47%) and data protection concerns (42%). 
To stay in step with consumer expectations, businesses need to adapt to payments trends
With increasing consumer interest around new payment technologies, the expectation for businesses to adapt for the long-term is here to stay. What’s more, a recent study on 5,500 major Mastercard merchants showed that between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, more than a fifth of these merchants globally increased the number of ways they connect with consumers, either by enabling an e-commerce channel or accepting contactless transactions.
Contactless transactions soar 
Over the same one-year period, Mastercard saw the total number of card-not-present (i.e. e-commerce) transactions it processed on its network grow by over 30% globally while more than 100 markets saw contactless as a share of total in-person transactions grow by at least 50%. In the first quarter of 2021 alone, Mastercard saw one billion more contactless transactions as compared to the same period of 2020, with particular momentum in India and Thailand where usage grew by 2x and 4x respectively year-over-year. 
How Mastercard is facilitating the future of payments 
As consumers shop, bank and transact online more than ever, Mastercard recently announced that it has strengthened its Digital First program in Asia Pacific to maximise the safety, security and convenience of e-commerce, online banking and touchless transactions. With the collaboration of a range of innovative partners, the program offers consumers the ease of applying online, rapid access to begin making purchases, flexibility and peace-of-mind while shopping. 
In addition, consumers enjoy an array of payment options spanning digital cards, direct payments from bank accounts via smartphones, smartwatches or any other digital device. Most recently, Mastercard launched its QR on Card solution in India – a world first – giving small businesses the ability to securely pay and get paid directly through their card via an embedded QR code.

Asia Asset Finance Plc has announced plans to raise Rs. 414 million via a Rights Issue of convertible irredeemable five-year preference shares of Rs. 10 face value at a fixed non-cumulative dividend of 70 cents in any financial year. 
The move is to increase the core capital of the company in terms of Finance Companies (Minimum Core Capital) Direction No. 02 of 2017.
The current stated capital of the company is Rs. 1,791,478,691 represented by 124,195,533 ordinary shares. The basis will be in the ratio of one preference share for every three ordinary shares held, as follows:

Number of preference shares to be issued by way of a rights issue shall be 41,398,511 preference shares at a consideration of Rs. 10 per preference share, which consideration is in the opinion of the Board fair and reasonable to the company and to all existing shareholders of the company of a tenure of five years from the date of issue, 
Carrying a preferential non-cumulative dividend of Rs.0/70 Cts. per preference share per financial year [the payment of the dividend could be reduced or waived off permanently in the event of profit being inadequate to support such payment in part or in full, as stipulated in the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011, under the definition of core capital]
At a convertible price which shall be the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the ordinary shares as published by the Colombo Stock Exchange over the 60 trading days immediately preceding the date of issue of the preference shares, (without the requirement of a payment of an additional consideration), in to such number of fully paid ordinary shares, determined by dividing the applicable original issue price of such preference shares by the aforesaid applicable conversion price, (any fractions arising on such conversion to be ignored and to be dealt with at the discretion of the Board) which is in the opinion of the Board fair and reasonable to the company and to the existing shareholders of the company
the convertible price, shall be adjusted at the discretion of the Board, in the event of an increase or decrease in the total number of ordinary shares in issue (post the issue of the preference shares), for any reason whatsoever, including right issues, issue of shares by capitalisation of reserves, subdivision of shares, consolidation of shares, repurchase of shares, share dividends or other change in the company’s share capital structure so as to prevent the enhancement or dilution of rights of the issued preference shares,
the preference shares to be deemed converted, immediately upon the completion of five years from the date of issue and to be listed subsequently,
carry a right to participate in any winding up or liquidation of the company in priority only to ordinary shares of the company (pari passu amongst the preference shareholders) in the event of winding up or liquidation as the case may be and the right to participate in a repurchase scheme affecting such preference shares and occurring during the tenure of the preference shares. 

The primary purpose of this issue is to enable the company to meet its Central Bank stipulated core capital requirement of Rs. 2.5 billion as set out in the Finance Business Act No 42 of 2011 and consequently, to make use of this opportunity to further enhance its capital base so as to be able to enhance its gold loan portfolio as well as meet other likely commercial requirements.
The Rights Issue is subject to the Colombo Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka, approving (as appropriate) in principle, the issue and listing of the preference shares and the issue and listing of the ordinary shares post conversion of the preference shares, as aforesaid, by way of a private placement, and obtaining shareholder approval by way of a special resolution, at a general meeting.

LONDON (Reuters): When much of the global economy locked down last year, insurers, facing estimated losses of more than $ 100 billion globally, reached straight for their red pens to strike pandemic cover from all new business policies.
Denis Kessler, Chairman and CEO of French reinsurer SCOR, summed it up when he told a recent conference that pandemic risk was like war.
“We exclude war – it’s not insurable,” he said.
But as industries spanning travel and hospitality to construction and manufacturing revert to a new normal, huge demand is causing insurers to figure out how they can put pandemic risk back in policies without making them prohibitively expensive.
One example is the film and television industry.
US company SpottedRisk has devised a model built on years of data on the political and economic environment of film locations in 150 countries, as well as a year’s COVID-19 shutdown data, to come up with a pricing mechanism to cover the risk of production stopping due to the pandemic.
“I had been told by 20-plus industry insiders that it was going to be impossible, but we found a way,” said SpottedRisk chief executive Janet Comenos.
The company, which declined to name its clients, said its insurance policy has enabled 19 independent film and TV productions with budgets of between $ 1 and $ 85 million to film at locations across the globe.
The SpottedRisk policy, which typically costs between $ 50,000 and $ 80,000 for $ 1 million of cover, helps to fill a gap in Hollywood where independent filmmakers have bemoaned the lack of cover, and contrasts with Britain, where a government scheme to enable film and TV production to go ahead has no insurer involvement.
While the film industry’s risks are relatively contained over finite time periods, industries such as airlines have much higher potential losses and may prove harder to insure, with many insurers saying extensive cover can only come back if governments provide the same kind of backstop they offer for floods or terror attacks in some countries.
Remodelling
Insurers do not want to be caught out again, having failed to predict the extent to which economies around the world would lock up in order to suppress the virus and keep juddering health systems afloat.
“Our modelling does capture infections and mortality,” said Robert Muir-Wood, chief research officer at risk modelling firm RMS.
“It didn’t capture all the subtlety of how governments respond, driven by the number of vacant ICU (intensive care unit) beds.” RMS is now factoring those in. Government responses meant that, surprisingly, claims on trade credit, event cancellation and business interruption insurance were higher than for life insurance, industry sources said, because many of those who died may not have held life insurance due to their age. “A year ago, on the non-life side we had essentially no pandemic modelling skills,” said Iwan Stalder, head of accumulation management at insurer Zurich, who has since been engaged in broader scenario modelling for pandemics.
Few have returned to offering pandemic cover for non-life policies, except where events have been scheduled long in advance and insurance bought years ago, such as the Olympics.
Cancellation of the Olympics would result in a “mind-blowingly” large loss of $ 2-3 billion, insurance sources say. Instead, insurers have asked governments for help.
Britain, the European Union and the United States are all looking at arrangements in which cover from commercial insurers would be backed by government reinsurance schemes. Such schemes could be less costly than business bailouts but the process of developing them is slow, as governments grapple with the problems at hand.
Creative solutions 
Some say commercial insurers are capable of doing more.
“The private market has the ability to create solutions,” said Rod Fox, CEO of broker TigerRisk Partners, which helped SpottedRisk find underwriters for its film and TV policy.
Another way to cover COVID-19 could be to repackage pandemic risk as debt through so-called insurance-linked securities (ILS), sharing that risk with investors such as pension funds.
“It became clear to us early in the pandemic that the models which were appropriate prior to COVID were no longer appropriate,” said Scott Mitchell, portfolio manager for life ILS at fund manager Schroders.
“COVID-specific aspects simply weren’t captured...the characteristics of the disease and the response by governments, and political factors that were involved in that.”
Schroders has developed new types of life ILS which take account of factors beyond mortality rates.
Insurers are also working on so-called parametric policies. These automatically pay out a specified amount when a certain trigger is reached, such as a government shutdown. “If you put a boundary around it, you can price the risk,” said Greg Medcraft, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developments director for financial and enterprise affairs.“For low probability, high impact events like climate change, cyber, pandemics – you have to have a new way of thinking.” While pandemics as a whole are hard to cover, some insurers have managed to slice out small parts of the risk, for instance providing travel insurance for short periods, or extra medical insurance for coronavirus patients after they leave hospital.
But policyholders may have to accept more expense in future.
Businesses will likely need to show insurers they are minimising their risks, for instance by requiring a negative COVID-19 test for spectators at live events, said Paula Jarzabkowski, professor of strategic management at City University of London.
And to enable insurers to bring in enough premium to cover pandemic risk, businesses interruption insurance may need to be mandatory, like motor insurance, she added.
“That does ensure that everybody who is prone to the possible risk takes some level of responsibility towards it.”

BOC DGM Retail Banking Range ll B.K. Gurusinghe
 


Offers industry-specific development loans plus SME-focused specialist expertise 
Grants 685,506 SME loans worth Rs. 128.8 b in 2020


Bank of Ceylon (BOC) yesterday said it was boosting the national economy via revival of businesses with industry-specific development loans and SME-focused specialist expertise. Here, BOC’s DGM Retail Banking Range ll B.K. Gurusinghe discusses BOC’s unique position as a leading facilitator of development loans and a key contributor to national GDP therein, plus the bank’s shift in focus from loan recovery to business revival:

BOC’s industry-wide standing as ‘Bankers to the Nation’ renders further importance to development loans as vital credit facilities contributing to national economic development. An integral part of BOC’s banking product mix, development loans allow the bank to continuously impact national GDP through targeting of critical sectors while boosting imports and reducing the import-export deficit. 
The bank’s national development efforts are reinforced by the strong alignment of the associated strategies with the development aims of the Government, with export, tourism, SMEs, youth and women identified as priority sector lending areas, allowing the bank keener focus in disbursing development loans accurately.
While adhering to Government-stipulated regulations in granting such loans, BOC offers the lowest interest rate and maximum repayment period based on income generated, allowing customers an extended grace period. 
Of equal importance in the disbursement of such loans is BOC’s acceptance of relaxed security or collateral, oftentimes based on the project value itself. This allows BOC customers added confidence to overcome the lack of security or collateral and initiate their entrepreneurial projects. A parallel strength of the bank involves the ability to accurately forecast income from projects, as development loans are entirely based on forecasted income, allowing customers to experience steady and consistent growth over time while individually supporting the national economy. 
It is understood that development loans account for a massive 52% of national GDP, and the SME sector comprises over 90% of total entrepreneurs in the non-agriculture sector, in parallel generating 45% of employment country-wide. These numbers singly justify BOC’s keen and continuous emphasis on development lending.
As a bank with a network of 600-plus branches islandwide, BOC displays a massive sense of responsibility in actively leading the country’s development-focused activities while drawing on its physical infrastructure plus specialist expertise in loan schemes across areas such as SMEs, animal husbandry, agriculture, and fisheries. This strengthens the bank’s offering of highly specialised loans for specific tasks including building tanks, acquiring nets, and so on. 
BOC’s strength in the area of development credit can be attributed to the numerous circulars fine-tuned over many years plus the tailor-made staff training programs that have allowed for the development of industry-specific loan expertise in areas ranging from fisheries along the coastal belt to paddy-focused loans in areas such as Anuradhapura.
BOC’s primary objective through the provision of development loans continues to be the gradual breaking of the poverty cycle that affects many across the country. Through the bank’s services and assistance across this sector, production is boosted, consequently improving national GDP. Improved production levels within the country directly correlate to greater per capita income and subsequent breaking of the cycle of poverty.
This bears close resemblance to BOC’s ongoing efforts in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a primary focus on offering loans to customers to keep their businesses afloat and continue operations, in parallel providing highly specific loan concessions as part of the loan moratorium extended to BOC customers.
These include the ‘Moratorium for COVID-19 affected businesses’ loan with an ROI of 7% p.a; a special moratorium for businesses affected by the second wave of the pandemic in October 2020; plus the ‘Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility’ providing an ROI of 4% p.a. for repayment in 24 months along with a grace period of six months.
BOC’s strength as a key national facilitator of loans extends to other areas of lending equally, with personal loans totalling Rs. 414.05 billion with 351,374 loans disbursed; SME loans equalling Rs. 128.8 billion with 685,506 loans granted; leasing amounting to Rs. 30.69 billion with 29,630 leases; housing totalling Rs. 73 billion with 101,722 housing loans given; and pawning equalling Rs. 72.14 billion, with 19,891 loans disbursed.
The conducting of awareness campaigns on critical aspects of loan products complements BOC’s multidimensional loan facilities. Hampered in 2020 and resumed this year, the bank has paid attention across these programs to specialist areas including fisheries sector entrepreneurs, prawn culture societies, and pea sector entrepreneurs. Conducted under the BOC Divi Udana program, these programs targeting the SME sector while in parallel offering development loans have been taken islandwide.
BOC’s approach to loans stands in contrast to that of its competitors, clearly discerned in the specialised clinics hosted across the island, with a shift in focus from loan recovery to business revival. The clinics offer customers from low-income groups an opportunity to negotiate and learn from AGMs and DGMs appointed specifically for one-on-one business consulting, allowing for identification of reasons for business failure and subsequent business rehabilitation. 
As part of this effort, BOC analyses if the customer is still in business, whether they are experiencing growing concerns, and if the business is viable and lucrative, before carrying out funding while appointing a staff member to closely monitor how the additional funds are utilised and how their businesses are operated.
A point stressed on constantly to BOC customers, especially those who are keen to enter the SME industry, is that BOC is committed to supporting all entrepreneurial efforts. What is of primary importance is not the size of the operation, but the planting of an idea and its continuous growth through research across areas ranging from understanding competitors fully, and comprehending their strategies, to identifying pricing methods. 
Importance should be afforded in early entrepreneurship to structuring the project and commencing operations at a small scale to have a foundation when approaching the bank. BOC consistently maintains, banking support is secondary and the idea comes first. Equally, the bank stresses on the need for SME entrepreneurs to inculcate financial discipline and grow capital. Further, during the initial stage, it is important to be involved full-time and devote 100% of one’s attention to the project. 
BOC stands ready to extend its fullest support to entrepreneurs who approach the bank with the right business components for entrepreneurial success. On the part of potential entrepreneurs, necessary elements include a dynamic idea, a firm vision for the business, plus strong belief in the concept. BOC will continue to support individual and business ambitions and strengthen the national economy, while leveraging its unmatched experience and specialist expertise in the areas of SME and development loans.

LONDON (REUTERS): The dollar held at 2-1/2-month lows on Monday as a weak US employment report spurred investors to unwind growing long positions in the greenback, with major rivals, including the British pound and Australian dollar testing key levels.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rivals, stood at 90.13, broadly flat on the day, after dipping as low as 90.128 for the first time since 26 Feb. earlier in the session.
The greenback’s losses in London trading were at odds with the broader markets where equity prices were higher and benchmark US Treasury yields well above Friday’s lows.
“There are plenty of key technical levels now broken on the pound and the Aussie, and without support from a Fed unwilling to taper, let alone raise rates, the dollar could have some hard sessions ahead,” said John Marley, CEO of forexxtra, a London-based FX consultancy.
The United States created a little more than a quarter of the jobs that economists had forecast last month and the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked higher, casting doubt on whether the Fed would consider advancing the timeline for tightening policy in the coming months.
“The more erratic the recovery on the US labour market, the longer the Fed will take to consider rate steps,” Commerzbank Strategists said in a daily note.
Even before the big payrolls miss, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had argued the US labour market is far short of where it needs to be to start talking of tapering asset purchases, and that a near-term spike in inflation will be transitory.
Several Fed officials will have a chance to reinforce that message this week, beginning with Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday.
Pound soars 
The British pound was the biggest gainer among the most-traded currencies, rallying 0.8% above $ 1.41, the highest since 25 Feb. This was despite Scotland’s leader saying that another referendum on independence is inevitable after her party’s resounding election victory.
Such a referendum requires the backing of the UK Government in London and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ruled out holding another vote, saying the country faces more pressing challenges such as economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
The Australian dollar was another beneficiary of the weakening dollar trend, with a surge in commodity prices also supporting the Antipodean currency.
The Aussie dollar traded close to a more-than-two-month high at $ 0.7884, while the US dollar fell to a fresh 3-1/2-year low of $ 1.2111 against its Canadian rival.
The euro rose 0.1% to $ 1.2170, earlier touching the highest since 26 Feb. at $ 1.2177.
“The unexpected slow recovery in the US labour market reinforces the FOMC’s patient approach to monetary policy,” while “the improving global economic outlook is a medium-term weight on the USD,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia Strategist Kim Mundy wrote in a client note, predicting a break above $ 1.22 for the euro.
That view was shared by J.P. Morgan Strategists, who cut their net long dollar positions against a basket of G10 currencies, notably the euro and the Antipodean currencies. Broader positioning data also revealed a similar trend.
In cryptocurrencies, ether ETH=BTSP> extended this month’s record run, surging more than 5% to an unprecedented $ 4,148.88. The second-biggest digital token has rallied 41% so far in May.

Reuters: Gold prices rose on Monday, hovering near a three-month peak, as a miss in the US jobs numbers last week cemented expectations that interest rates will remain low for some time, denting the dollar and boosting non-yielding metal’s appeal.
Spot gold was up 0.4% to $ 1,836.80 per ounce by 10:22 GMT, after hitting its highest since 11 Feb. at $ 1,842.91 on Friday. US gold futures gained 0.4% to $ 1,838.10.
“We are seeing a carry over this morning from Friday’s non-farm payrolls figures which were surprisingly disappointing. Clearly, both the US dollar and yields remain on the back foot, supporting gold,” said independent analyst Ross Norman.
US non-farm payrolls data on Friday showed jobs growth unexpectedly slowed in April, pushing the dollar to a more than two-month trough, making gold less expensive for holders of other currencies.
Lower-than-expected non-farm payrolls numbers came as a speed bump on investor hopes over roaring recovery in the world’s largest economy and tampered down bets over US Federal Reserve tightening policy earlier than expected.
The US Central Bank has pledged to keep interest rates low until inflation and employment pick up. Lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.
“After weeks of snail-like progress, gold has suddenly accelerated higher, driven by a weaker US dollar and ebbing fears of an early Federal Reserve taper,” OANDA Senior Market Analyst Jeffrey Halley said in note.
Elsewhere, palladium rose 1.3% to $ 2,964.85 per ounce after hitting an all-time high last week on supply shortfall worries.
“We expect the (palladium) market to continue tightening over the next three months on auto-restocking and the lingering impact from Norilsk supply disruptions,” Citi analysts said in a note.
UBS expects the palladium market to be undersupplied by about one million ounces in 2021.
Silver climbed 1.1% to $ 27.74 while platinum was up 1.3% to $ 1,265.51.

TOKYO (Reuters): Stocks rose on Monday amid speculation that interest rates will remain low due to receding inflationary pressure, while oil and gas prices jumped after a cyber-attack on a US pipeline operator unnerved markets.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.35%, while US stock futures rose 0.24%.
Australian stocks hit their highest in more than a year, boosted by gains in miners, and shares in China rose 0.46%. Japanese shares gained 0.91%.
US nonfarm payrolls data on Friday showed jobs growth unexpectedly slowed in April, which gave equities a lift but put downward pressure on the dollar and US Treasury yields.
Oil and gasoline futures extended gains after a cyber-attack shut down a US pipeline operator that provides nearly half of the US east coast’s fuel supply.
“It certainly pushes back the timetable for Fed tapering, perhaps to December from the prior expectations of the Jackson Hole Symposium in late August,” Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone in Melbourne, wrote in a memo.
“A softer payrolls is good for the reflation trade; the dollar weakened across the FX spectrum. We’ve also seen a solid bid in equity indices and futures are up.” On Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rose to record closing highs after disappointing data on the US jobs market eased concerns about a spike in consumer prices.
In recent weeks, some investors had been placing bets that a robust US economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic would force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates earlier than the central bank has outlined.
However, the weak nonfarm payrolls report caused a rapid reversal in some of these trades, which rippled through stocks, bonds, and major currencies.
The focus now shifts to US consumer price data due on Wednesday, which will help investors determine whether they need to scale back their inflation expectations even further.
MSCI’s broadest index of global stock markets hit a record high on expectations that low rates will continue to spur lending and economic growth.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies edged up to 90.252 but was still near its weakest since 24 Feb.
The British pound jumped to the highest in more than two months against the greenback, but worries about Scottish independence could curb sterling’s gains, traders said.
China’s onshore spot yuan strengthened past 6.43 per dollar for first time since 10 Feb.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes steadied at 1.5983% in Asia on Monday after having plunged to a two-month low of 1.4690% on Friday.
US crude ticked up 1.17% to $ 65.66 a barrel. Brent crude rose to 1.11% to $ 69.04 per barrel in Asian trading as the disruption to US supplies rattled energy markets.
Gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 2.07% to $ 2.1710 a gallon, near a three-year high.
The White House is working closely with top US fuel pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline on Sunday to help it recover from a ransomware attack that forced the company to shut its main fuel lines.

Weekly auction demand increases; bond activity increases
Foreign holding in Rupee bonds reduces
Money market liquidity dips


By Wealth Trust Securities 

The secondary bond market sentiment turned positive during the week ending 7 May, reversing its bearish sentiment witnessed over the previous week, driven by persistent and continuous buying interest mainly on the very short end of the yield curve. The bullish sentiment was supported by the outcome of the weekly Treasury bill auction, where the total subscription increased to 77.58% while the 364-day bill cut-off rate stood steady at 5.18% for a third consecutive week.
Yields of the most sorted maturities of 2022’s (i.e. 01.10.22, 15.11.22 and 15.12.22) and 2023’s (i.e. 15.07.23, 01.09.23 and 15.11.23) hit weekly lows of 5.65%, 5.67%, 5.73%, 6.20%, 6.22% and 6.32%, respectively, against its previous weeks closing levels of 5.90/00, 5.95/03 each, 6.45/55, 6.45/60 and 6.52/60. 
In addition, maturities of 01.12.24, 01.05.25, early 2026’s (i.e. 15.01.26 and 01.02.26) and 01.08.26 changed hands at the levels of 6.70% to 6.80%, 7.05%, 7.32% to 7.38% and 7.60% to 7.75%, respectively, as well, which led to a downward shift of the yield curve, week on week. 
The foreign holding in Rupee bonds recorded a decrease of Rs. 730.3 million for the week ending 5 May 2021 while the daily secondary market Treasury bond/bill transacted volumes for the first four trading days of the week averaged Rs. 13.73 billion. 
In money markets, the total outstanding liquidity surplus decreased to Rs. 135.17 billion against its previous week’s Rs. 151.31 billion while the CBSL’s holding of Government securities, too, decreased to Rs. 870.37 billion against its previous week’s Rs. 888.70 billion. The weighted average rates on overnight call money and repo remained mostly unchanged to average 4.66% and 4.69%, respectively, for the week.

USD/LKR
In the forex market, USD/LKR rate on spot contracts traded at levels of Rs. 199.85 to Rs. 200.99 during the week while one-month forward contracts saw buying interest at Rs. 199 towards the latter part of the week.
The daily USD/LKR average traded volume for the first four days of the week stood at $ 36.01 million.

BOSTON (Reuters): BlackRock voted against more company directors and backed more shareholder resolutions in the first quarter than a year earlier, as the world’s biggest asset manager looks to push boards to do more on climate and other sustainability issues.
The information from the $ 9 trillion New York-based money manager in a report to be released on Wednesday helps to explain what is shaping up to be a tough shareholder voting season at major corporations this spring.
Just on Tuesday, investors rejected the pay of executives at GE Corp, for instance, and last week gave a record level of support, 81%, to a resolution calling for a report on plastics pollution at Dupont.
Both votes took place after the first-quarter period covered by BlackRock’s report. But in a separate piece posted on its website on Wednesday, BlackRock said it voted against the pay at GE, and against board compensation committee members, “given the misalignment of pay and performance”. 
In addition, BlackRock said it supported a resolution calling for a so-called “say on climate” advisory vote on greenhouse gas emissions at Charter Communications Inc on 27 April. The measure drew support from 39% of votes cast.
Together the material suggested BlackRock taking a more aggressive stance under Sandy Boss, the company’s London-based global head of investment stewardship since 2020.
“We are accelerating the pace of our stewardship activities; resulting in more engagement and more voting, reflecting heightened expectations, which... are just a function of the urgency of some of the issues,” Boss said in an interview.
Boss declined to comment on votes since April or upcoming ones. Activists have urged BlackRock and other influential top investors to push their portfolio companies more after years of fund manager votes that rubber-stamped management wishes.
For instance, BlackRock said on Wednesday it had abstained from voting at Barclays PLC on a resolution calling for the bank to phase out fossil fuel financing shareholders largely opposed. BlackRock said the resolution’s wording was “imprecise and ambiguous.” 
Citing that vote and others yet to come at companies like Duke Energy and ExxonMobil, Sierra Club official Ben Cushing said in a statement that BlackRock is “taking too much credit, too soon”. Among other things, BlackRock said it had backed three-quarters of the environment and social-focused resolutions filed by shareholders during the first quarter, including eight environment-focused votes.
In the same period last year, BlackRock’s support for such resolutions was less than 10%, the report showed, including its opposition to all three environmental resolutions on which it cast ballots.
Of the 2,600 shareholder meetings held in the period, at which BlackRock voted on more than 21,000 proposals, the money manager said it had voted against management on one or more proposals at 35% of meetings, up from 30% a year earlier.
BlackRock said it did not back directors or director-related proposals 12% of the time, up from 9% a year ago. Reasons included a lack of board diversity, misaligned pay and a lack of independence.

With market uncertainty and disruptions across different business verticals christened as the ‘new normal’, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the modern-day has many elements to balance across the business. In such a context, strengthening business resilience is a crucial responsibility that a CFO has on his agenda. But has a CFO’s focus become too narrow, making the company’s short and long-term plans unbalanced?  

What are the true components of business resilience?
A recent study conducted by McKinsey1 analysed more than 1,000 global organisations during the first wave of COVID. Out of these publically traded organisations, McKinsey found out a smaller populace of 10% had performed extremely well during this economic downturn. How did they manage to ensure business resiliency during these challenging times? 
They had three aspects. Firstly, these companies had put strong measures to empower finance as an active function of the business effectively. This means that conversations stemming from the finance function have become more relevant for employees, and these discussions have become immediately actionable across the business. Throughout the organisation, financial professionals have been placed strategically to unlock the value of siloed data to provide fresh perspectives to reimagine the business in challenging times.
Secondly, the finance function would have always been tested against a series of probable scenarios. These scenarios could include historical data analysis (an analysis of past events), assessing future-related disruptions and more. These help the CFO identify and discuss what the risk factors are for the business. Sharing these insights across the business elevated the Finance function as the true guardian of the organisation. 
Finally, the CFO has been able to create values and manage the topline and bottom line of the business perfectly and, at the same time, unravel the full potential of the business. This was a crucial aspect that the finance function had to get right – to progress amidst challenging times, the CFO needed to ensure that the organisation’s cash flow did not get disrupted. “Stay liquid” has been the name of the game in most organisations that were successful during the pandemic.    

Data-driven business visibility empowers business resiliency
We can learn from the McKinsey study that business resilience and clear, actionable insights sync perfectly; they go hand-in-hand. If you look closer, the three aspects of becoming a truly resilient organisation do not only mean that a business continues to operate normally during times like these. It also means shining a guiding light across the whole business to strengthen the finance function further.
In such a context, it would be great if we, the financial professionals, ask ourselves some crucial questions to embed business resilience within every process of our enterprises. Several questions come to mind – how swiftly and consistently can your business react to events like COVID? What can you do to enable your employees to stay attentive and inspired during challenging times?  
Of course, we will not have all the answers at our fingertips. But organisations could go a long way if they have a clear view of the business. A clear vision helps the finance department analyse relevant insights to identify opportunities and challenges to craft long-term goals and plans. This can be particularly useful to support business-wide scenario planning.
Most importantly, an insight-driven approach will help a business tally its business data with human capital insights. This helps the CFO understand how different business units are responding to the test of change. These insights can be embedded into an organisation’s long term strategy where they will be useful when safeguarding business value in varying markets and situations like market diversification. The CFO can play a crucial role by utilising next-gen digital technologies like AI, machine learning and blockchain, together with human innovation, to reimagine their businesses to fit into the new normal. By doing that, they can craft an internal strategy for business resiliency to support the organisation.    

Graduating from cost optimisation to wealth creation
Most people are of the view that CFOs or finance professionals are there to save cost. I believe and continue to believe that cost optimisation is a fundamental yet generic function of any business organisation. Hence, the most important role of a CFO is to create wealth within the organisation, which allows the business to absorb any internal and external shocks while supporting the business model to reach new heights. The value creation within the organisation enables fulfilling the aspirations of all stakeholders, irrespective of the unforeseen risks and tough times the business may have to go through.  
I have seen these aspects enable us at 99x to create sustainable wealth within the organisation, which has allowed us to navigate the stormy seas of the pandemic while enhancing the employee emoluments.

With regards to the recent IPO for Prime Lands Residencies, it can be noted that the company has an overly conservative revenue recognition policy. The company only recognises revenue on the sale of an apartment when over 25% of construction is complete and over 20% of payments are handed in. Even then the company only recognises the lower of these two figures in its books.
Now many would prefer a company to understate than overstate its books but this raises huge questions on cost recognition. We see huge rises in advances paid to contractors from 2018 onwards and it is probably representative of apartments already constructed.
Though the accounting standard and auditor might allow for the recognition of these costs in the year that the apartments are to be sold; management and the investor community must question if this accounting policy gives a true reflection of the company. None of the investor analysis seems to allow for a decrease in the value of apartments which, given the glut in the market and the absence of ex-pat tenants, would be prudent.
Though operationally the company seems to be doing well, the cash flow and balance sheet seem to be raising questions that it would be in the interests of the company to answer. 
The Prince of Kandy
Acuity Partners responds 

Prime Lands Residencies Ltd.’s IPO managers and financial advisors Acuity Partners Ltd. issued the following clarification to the above.
The company (Prime Lands Residencies) has adopted the revenue recognition policy keeping in line with the accounting standards as well as the auditor’s concurrence for the same. This prudent revenue recognition policy has been adopted by the company in order to ensure that the revenue is maintained on a consistent basis by avoiding the possibility of any re-sale adjustments, which is quite a common occurrence in the residential real estate industry. 
In the event a re-sale adjustment is required, it would have an impact on the already-recognised revenue, which reflects an inconsistency and also could be used for financial statement manipulation, which the company is keen to avoid. 
To further elaborate, in the company’s experience, the possibility of a unit resulting in a re-sale after the initial reservation advance is quite high, but once a customer has paid 20% or more of the total amount, then this possibility reduces drastically. The 20% threshold with regard to the customer advances for revenue recognition has been selected on this basis. 
Furthermore, with the advances paid to contractors being illustrated clearly in the financial statements, any discerning investor could carry out a thorough analysis in order to analyse the possibility of the realisation of future profit.
The reason for the significant increase in the advances paid to contractors since 2018 is mainly owing to The Grand project, which is a significantly larger project in value terms and is also a project that takes a longer than average time to complete. On this basis, the large portion of the revenue and the corresponding cost will be recognised only towards the latter stages of the project as evident from the recent financial statements.
The views on the reduction in the apartment values are subjective and would be based on individual viewpoints, however, since the company recognises revenue on units, which are actually sold and the payment plans are in progress, any increases or reductions in apartment values will not have a retrospective effect on the past financials. 
Furthermore, we believe that residential real estate investors are long-term investors with a long-term investment horizon, which means that the current state, which is global, would only have a relatively low short-term impact on the investment decisions. Furthermore, the company is confident of its ability to sell the units developed and is able to withstand any short-term slowdowns.

NEW YORK (Reuters): Global commercial insurance prices rose 18% in the first quarter of 2021 from a year earlier, on average, but the increase was less than in other recent quarters and marks the first slowing in more than three years, insurance broker Marsh McLennan Cos Inc. said on Tuesday.
Marsh's global insurance index registered average annual price increase of 22% and 20% in the fourth quarter and third quarters of 2020, respectively, Marsh said. The decline in the growth rate was the first since the index of rates began rising in the fourth quarter of 2017.
The data, which also showed the rate of increase slowing in all regions of the world, provide an indication that rate rises may be topping out after climbing for 13 consecutive quarters.
“We expect price increases to continue to moderate throughout the rest of the year,” Lucy Clarke, president of Marsh Specialty and Marsh Global Placement, said in a press release announcing the study.
Cyber insurance marked the one exception to slowing price increases: rates rose 35% in the US, up from 17% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and 29% in the UK, up from 26%, Marsh said.
Cyber insurance costs have been climbing as more companies, in sectors from banking to retail, rely on online technology while ransomware attacks are growing in size, frequency and sophistication, insurance experts say.
Prices of property insurance, globally, rose 15% in the first quarter. Prices for casualty insurance rose 6% and the rise was 40% in financial and professional lines, which includes coverage for directors and officers and cyber risk.
Marsh noted its average increases are derived from prices experienced by a variety of different customers and reflect price changes that can be higher or lower than the average.

Bank of Ceylon completed 40 years of service to the community in Maldives on 7 May. As a leading bank, BOC Malé continues to play a significant role as a banking and financial services provider to the Maldives and an important offshore
branch of Sri Lankan origin that is of greater significance to uplifting Sri Lanka’s economic profile.
Marking its global presence, since the inauguration of the London Branch, BOC opened its first branch in Malé in 1981, making it the second foreign branch of the bank. BOC continued to expand its reach with branches in Chennai and Seychelles. 
Having firmly established operations in Male’, Bank of Ceylon went on to open its second Maldivian branch in Hulhumalé in 2019. This initiative was an extension of the bank’s vision to build a strong global presence, with its own branch network, that could generate foreign income flows to Sri Lanka. To date Bank of Ceylon has expanded its overseas operations to London, Maldives (Malé and Hulhumale), Chennai and Seychelles, with five foreign counterparts under the Bank of Ceylon brand.
Since its establishment Bank of Ceylon, Maldives has been a partner in developing the economy of the Republic of Maldives over the last four decades. BOC actively contributed by funding the Hulhumalé Reclamation Project Phase II, which is one of the largest projects ever undertaken in Maldives to date. BOC Maldives has an enviable market share in deposits and advances, while the bank’s considerable contribution in development of the tourism sector is widely acknowledged. Although the Maldives was adversely affected by the Covid-19 Pandemic, BOC, Maldives was able to record a remarkable performance for year 2020.
The bank has also been instrumental in boosting the aviation sector, as well as fisheries projects and housing sector in the Maldives. As a fully-fledged branch, BOC Maldives provides a full gamut of commercial banking services, which includes personal banking, corporate banking, development banking, trade finance, remittance services, foreign currency operations and other financial services, vis-à-vis deposit products to the people of the Maldives, whilst contributing to the socio-economic development of the country.  
Through its operations over the last four decades, the branch has earned the trust and goodwill of the community, the Maldivian Government and the business community of the country. The diverse customer base includes a multitude of individual customers, corporates, and the expatriate community from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, etc.
Always at the forefront of introducing new and emerging technologies throughout, BOC has the honour of being the first bank in the Maldives to introduce ATMs. The bank continues to introduce the latest in technology led products, leading the way through innovation. With the advent of digital banking, BOC Maldives has accelerated its digital drive with products such as B-app, IPG, and Smart Passbook among others. 
“BOC Maldives is a pioneer in the Maldives banking sector, with an unprecedented digital drive to fulfill the evolving aspirations of our valued customers. We continue to develop strategies to strengthen our digital backbone, while enhancing customer service excellence,” said Deputy General Manager International, Treasury and Investments R. M. N. Jeewantha.
In celebration of its 40th milestone, BOC Maldives branch has organised a customer felicitation ceremony, adhering to the prevailing health guidelines, and will launch a branded Debit Card for corporate customers. 
“Our focus in the coming years is to help reinstate the Maldives tourism industry, which is severely affected due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. We will continue to strengthen our relationships and grow our private sector corporate portfolio to achieve a balance as we have so far focused to serve the economy of the Maldives primarily by funding Government and State-Owned Enterprises. Being at the forefront in extending moratorium facilities for COVID-affected businesses and individuals, BOC Maldives has extended a significant amount of moratorium facilities. Building on the success of partnering in syndicated loan facilities, we will pursue further opportunities in syndicated loan facilities, either as the lead bank or as a partner,” said Bank of Ceylon Chairman Kanchana Ratwatte.
Commenting on the milestone, Bank of Ceylon General Manager D. P. K. Gunasekera said: “Managing different regulatory frameworks in several foreign banking landscapes, BOC has proven its resilience in its operations amidst many challenges, while complying with all regulatory requirements. With the achievements of the past paving the way for future aspirations, the bank will continue to serve all its stakeholders locally and offshore with the same commitment and passion.”
The bank currently employs more than 35 Maldivian nationals who have been trained and equipped with the required skills. The challenges of the COVID pandemic last year saw the entire team in the Maldives coming together and contributing immensely, together with the support of the Head Office to ensure uninterrupted services to customers. This unwavering team spirit enabled the bank to overcome the numerous challenges faced.
“Behind the success of the 40-year journey, the significant role of our valued customers, who continue to keep their trust with BOC Malé is remarkable. The sterling support given by the regulatory authorities in both Maldives and Sri Lanka in ensuring the creation and growth of a stable and resilient financial sector giant BOC Malé is immeasurable,” said BOC Malé and Hulhumalé Country Manager S. B. A. M. G. S. Arampath.

Flight sergeant M.R. Devapriya receives medical insurance cover by People’s Insurance Director and People’s Leasing CEO/GM Shamindra Marcellin
 

 

Marks move with most comprehensive cover in SL


In an unprecedented effort to enhance its product offerings to customers across Sri Lanka, People’s Insurance PLC recently announced its plans to diversify into the health insurance space of the country. This strategic move to establish its presence as a health insurance provider builds on the well-established public image of People’s Insurance as the insurer who cares with love.
As the market is already heavily saturated with health insurance products offered by the competition, People’s Insurance had the strategic objective of offering a product to make them stand out from the rest. Following a customer first approach, the insurer has decided to be a step above its competitors by offering a highly comprehensive medical insurance cover available in the country.
Citizens of Sri Lanka and those individuals who currently reside in the country are eligible to obtain a medical insurance cover from People’s Insurance. Individuals can be covered from their fifth birthday onwards. However, infants from the age of three months can also be protected by these covers provided that their parents have a medical cover from People’s Insurance too. 
People’s Insurance PLC Head of Operations Jeevani Kariyawasam commented on this new development, “When People’s Insurance PLC began to contemplate our entry into the health insurance sector, we knew we had to be different. As we are known as the only insurer who cares with love, our health insurance product had to reflect this strongly. Due to this, we decided to position ourselves as an insurance provider with a highly comprehensive product in the health insurance space. With affordable premiums, we have made every effort to ensure that Sri Lankans can enjoy the peace of mind that health insurance brings about.”
Medical schemes will vary from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 2 million and premiums will depend on the sum insured, along with the customer’s age band. It is also noteworthy that the geographical scope of treatment extends beyond Sri Lanka and into India as well. Costs related to ambulance call outs, inpatient proceedings, surgical treatments, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and pre and post hospitalisation expenses are just a few of the areas that this comprehensive product covers. 
As People’s Insurance PLC has a trusted and well-established name in the minds of Sri Lankan customers, it is expected that their entrance into the medical insurance sector will be welcomed by citizens across the island. With the underlying goal of caring for its customers beyond anything else, this new development will allow for more Sri Lankans access to proper healthcare services. This decision truly resonates with a purpose beyond profit initiative.

Acuity Partners Vice President Corporate Finance Amani Ranaweera


Prime Group Chairman Premalal Brahamanage


Prime Group Co-Chairperson Sandamini Rukmal Perera




Prime Lands Residencies signifies strong growth potential with 40% dividend payout envisaged







Prime Grand, Ward Place 

 




Prime Lands Residencies Ltd., the leader in the real estate industry, is heading for a new chapter as it seeks a listing on the Colombo Stock Exchange with its initial public offering (IPO). In this interview Amani Ranaweera, who is Vice President Corporate Finance at Acuity Partners – the firm that will be the managers and financial advisors to the Issue – shares key insights into Prime Lands Residencies as well as the IPO. She said that Prime Lands Residencies signifies strong growth potential with a 40% dividend payout envisaged. The IPO is also attractively priced, she added. Following are excerpts: 
Q: Can you please give us a summary of this IPO?
The IPO of Prime Lands Residencies is an ‘offer for subscription,’ meaning that it is a new issue of shares with the IPO proceeds coming into the company. 100 million new shares will be issued as a price of Rs. 10.40 per share with an option to issue a further 87.5 million shares in the event the first 100 million are oversubscribed.
This results in an IPO which will be a minimum of Rs. 1.04 billion going up to a maximum of Rs. 1.95 billion. If only the first tranche of shares is issued, the post-IPO public holding will amount to 11.74%, and if the option is exercised and 187.5 million shares are issued, the public holding will be 20%.
The IPO will open on 11 May 2021 and we expect to close on the same day. The Board of Directors of Prime Lands Residencies with the assistance of Acuity will decide on whether the option will be exercised.
 
Q: What will the IPO funds be used for?
The company has identified several purposes for which the IPO funds will be used. Firstly, Rs. 333 million will be used to settle the balance amount payable for the land the company acquired in Meegoda. Next, Rs. 150 million will be used to pay 50% of the mobilisation advance for the Gampaha project. Rs. 50 million will go towards the construction cost of the The Beach Front 2 Uswetakeiyawa, which is currently under construction, and Rs. 188 million will be used to settle some import loans that were taken for The Grand project which is falling due shortly. Any remaining amount will be used for the purposes of covering the construction cost of The Grand project. 
 
Q: What is the current status of The Grand Project?
 At present the company has sold 177 units of a total of 331 units, resulting in a sale value of nearly Rs. 14 billion. Despite the current economic conditions, as well as the social issues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has managed to sell nearly Rs. 900 million worth of units during the month of April. Apart from this it also needs to be pointed out that all six penthouses, each worth over Rs. 300 million have been sold, and of this, quite impressively, four were sold after the COVID-19 pandemic started. 
The project is due for completion by June 2022 and at present the super structure is completed with the finishing stage having commenced.
 
Q: What is the company’s future business strategy?
The company’s main focus within the residential real estate sector has always been the ‘Affordable Luxury’ and ‘Luxury’ categories, which are less vulnerable to market shocks. This will remain the main focus in the future as well. In terms of identifying the locations of projects to be launched in future, the company will decide based on the insights they get into the demand in each locality from parent company Prime Lands’ land-sale operations. 
In terms of the five projects that are earmarked for launch in 2021, the company has looked beyond the Colombo district. Of the five projects, the project in Gampaha was officially launched in mid-March and has secured presales for over 53% of the total 480 units by end March. This project is the largest project to be carried out by the company in terms of the number of units to date. 
Apart from that, the company will be launching a project in Kurunegala, just adjacent to the Central Expressway entrance, a project in Negombo and another in Meegoda, Homagama. In addition to this, a 43-luxury villa project will be launched in Ambewela, Nuwara Eliya this year. 

Q: How is the company’s financial performance? And what does the future look like?
From the 2016/17 financial year to the 2019/20 financial year, profit after tax was recorded as Rs. 1 billion, Rs. 715 million, Rs. 258 million and Rs. 138 million. The profitability has been at a low level for the last two financial years mainly down to the fact that the company did not launch any new projects as a result of the unfavourable market dynamics – and due to it also focusing on The Grand project. 
The company is expected to report a profit after tax of Rs. 975 million for the financial year 2020/21 on a revenue of Rs. 7.9 billion. Of this, for the 10 months ended 31 January 2021, the company recorded a profit of Rs. 736 million, which is based on the audited financial statements for the 10 months ended 31 January 2021. The main reason for this growth in revenue as well as profitability in the 2020/21 financial year is the commencement of the recognition of revenue from The Grand project.
Going forward profit is expected to increase to Rs. 1.4 billion, 1.8 billion, 2.4 billion and 2.6 billion over the next four financial years. 
 
Q: What is the revenue recognition policy of the company?
The company adopts a very prudent revenue recognition policy where there are two primary conditions that need to be met prior to the commencement of revenue recognition, that is, 25% of the construction should be completed and 20% of customer advances should be received. Once both these conditions are met revenue recognition will commence, but that too will be on the basis of percentage completion of construction and customer advances received. 
This policy means that the revenue that is recognised is based on actual cash receipts on units sold and relating to the particular level of construction completed.
 
Q: What is the basis of the IPO valuation?
In order to arrive at the IPO valuation, Acuity used three valuation methodologies, namely, discounted cash flow method, trailing Price-Earnings Method and forward Price-Earnings Method. Using the three methods we arrived at a value per share ranging from Rs. 15.82 to Rs. 20.02, with a simple average of Rs. 17.39 per share. The IPO price of Rs. 10.40 per share is at a discount of over 40% on this average value per share. 
The IPO price of Rs. 10.40 per share, translates into a Price-Earnings ratio of eight times, based on the expected earnings for the 2020/21 financial year on the pre-IPO number of shares. This further results in a very attractive Price-Earnings ratio of 6.53 times based on the forecasted earnings for the 2021/22 financial year, based on the post-IPO number of shares, using 187.5 million shares as being the number of shares issued at the IPO.
 
Q: What will be the dividend policy of the company?
 The company has decided on a dividend policy where a minimum of 40% of the profit after tax will be declared as dividends. Apart from this, IPO investors will also be eligible to the dividends that will be declared on the earnings for the 2020/21 financial year.
 
Q: What is the outlook for the residential real estate sector in Sri Lanka?
We have observed several factors that are currently contributing positively towards the growth of the sector. The historically low interest rates together with the regulatory policy changes with regard to the removal of VAT and NBT from condominium sales, as well as the relaxations with regard to foreign nations being allowed to acquire condominium property, has given a significant boost to the market. Apart from this, the depreciation of the rupee has also made local projects more attractive to foreign exchange earners, while the increasing percentage of household income being deployed for housing needs, together with the reducing household size and the resultant increase in the number of households, shows a steady demand for the industry. 
 
Q: How can investors apply for the IPO?
Investors have two options for applying. They can either apply using the manual form, sending the filled application form along with a cheque, bank draft or bank guarantee, or do a RTGS transfer for applications above Rs. 100 million, to either Acuity Partners Ltd., the managers to the Issue, SSP Corporates Services Ltd., Seylan Bank branches or to any stockbroker. 
Resident individual applicants also have the option to apply online either through the company website (https://ipo.primeresidencies.lk/) or through the CSE mobile app. If applying online the payment has to be done through an online transfer.

Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO Thushara Ranasinghe (centre), members of the management and branch staff at the foundation stone laying ceremony 

Ceylinco Life has laid the foundation for a new branch building in Ja-Ela, persisting with the Company’s investments in reducing its carbon footprint while enhancing the customer and employee experience with purpose-designed facilities.
A three-storey, fully solar-powered eco-friendly building will take shape in the months ahead at No 26, Highway Access Road, Ja-Ela, providing 9,870 square-feet of mission-specific office space on company-owned land, significantly strengthening Ceylinco Life’s presence in the area.
The new edifice will be powered entirely by a solar power system that results in zero consumption of electricity from the national grid, will have its own rainwater harvesting facility and a sewerage treatment plant that will recycle waste water for toilet flushing and gardening.
The building is also designed for optimal use of natural light and will be equipped with the latest energy-efficient lighting and air conditioning systems. The construction will minimise the use of timber, the company said. 
For customer and employee convenience, the new building will have an elevator and a dedicated car park with more than 15 slots, a spacious customer lounge and many other facilities for visitors and staff. The building will function as an office for several Ceylinco Life branches in the Ja-Ela area, and will be fifth building built on company-owned land in the Gampaha district, after the branches at Divulapitiya, Kadawatha, Gampaha, and Negombo. The building has been designed for future expansion as the need for more space arises.
Ceylinco Life is in the process of constructing another Green building for its branch in Piliyandala. The Company currently owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena, Mount Lavinia, and Wellawatte, many of which have already been converted to solar energy. New branch buildings purpose-built to the company’s sustainable energy model are those at Horana, Panadura, Wennappuwa, Bandarawela, Chilaw, Kadawatha, Jaffna, Malabe, Divulapitiya, and Negombo.
Ceylinco Life operates the largest network of 272 branches in Sri Lanka’s life insurance industry, giving it a physical presence in 142 cities, towns, and villages in every one of the island’s 25 districts.

DFCC Bank Chief Operating Officer Achintha Hewanayake (fourth from left) exchanging the signed MoU with Department for Registration Commissioner General P.V. Gunathilake flanked by the officials of DFCC Bank and the Department of Registrations
 

In an effort to optimise its overall customer verification process while developing the country through the carefully planned digital road map put forward by the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL), DFCC Bank recently signed a MoU with the Department for Registration of Persons (DRP). 
This MoU allows for DFCC Bank to make use of the online system for authentication plus verification of NIC details launched by the DRP to streamline the bank’s overall customer verification process. The new system will enable DFCC Bank to conduct real-time verification of customer identity through the use of the information contained in the DRP’s online system, provided that the customer provides their consent.
Digitalising this process will enable DFCC Bank to obtain accurate customer identification data in a timely manner. As identity information is an essential component of the banking function, capturing this data accurately is of paramount importance to DFCC Bank.
Once the customer provides consent, this MoU allows for DFCC Bank to view data and images of documents related to the NIC submitted by any customer in order to verify the authenticity of the particulars of the NIC, of the person who intends to obtain DFCC banking services.
For DFCC Bank, this means that their customers will no longer have to visit bank branches and fill physical forms to open accounts or obtain other DFCC Bank services. Instead, the entire onboarding process can now shift to a digital platform which is expected to increase levels of efficiency while improving customer convenience.
Standing tall as one of the most digitally enabled banks in the country, DFCC Bank’s quick adoption of this industry-wide solution developed in accordance with the requirement of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is a testament to this. As the Bank continues down the pathway of relentless digitalization, its customers will certainly welcome the ability to bank with more ease than ever before.

CEO Lakshman Silva




In the backdrop of an extremely challenging environment supporting the efforts by the Government to uplift and stabilise the economy, DFCC Bank said yesterday it continued its committed service to customers across the country providing essential banking services without interruption during these challenging times.
DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva said: “Given the ongoing uncertainties, we will pursue growth. Our focus will be to engage with our customers and ensure that we will be their pillar of strength to help them achieve success during these unprecedented times.” 
“We will also continue to expand our digital footprint to offer ease and convenience to our customers as we have now adopted the best practices in the industry and implemented systems to meet the future challenges that we foresee in the new normal,” he added. 
In a note accompanying interim results, DFCC Bank really swung in to full gear as a full service Commercial Bank marking 65 years of being a pioneer in Sri Lanka’s banking sector. The bank has made great strides recently to capture market share by demonstrating agility to embrace its goal of becoming a customer centric digitally enabled bank. 
The bank introduced several concessionary schemes to its clientele in accordance with the Directions/Guidelines of Central Bank of Sri Lanka extending financial and advisory support to all segments of customers.
DFCC Bank PLC, the largest entity within the Group, reported a profit before tax (PBT) of Rs. 1,915 million and a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs. 1,479 million for the quarter ended 31 March. This compares with a PBT of Rs. 1,295 million and a PAT of Rs. 925 million in the comparative period. The Group recorded a PBT of Rs. 2,036 million and PAT of Rs. 1,583 million for the quarter ended 31 March as compared to Rs. 1,408 million and Rs. 1,014 million respectively in the comparative period of year 2020.
All the member entities of the Group made positive contributions to this performance.
The basic earnings per ordinary share (EPS) of the bank improved to Rs. 4.80 for the quarter ended 31 March from Rs. 3.04 for the comparative period in year 2020 recording an increase of 58%. The bank’s Return on Equity (ROE) improved to 6% during the quarter ended 31 March from 4.93% recorded for the year ended 31 December 2020. The bank’s Return on Assets (ROA) before tax also improved to 0.91% during the quarter ended 31 March compared to 0.78% recorded for the year ended 31 December 2020.

Net Interest Income
The bank recorded a Rs. 2,679 million in net interest income (NII) which is a 10% decline year-on-year primarily due to the drop in AWPLR more than 370 bps over the past 12 months and due to the business implications that arose with the pandemic situation. In line with this trend and due to the time taken to re price the existing deposits to reflect market trends the interest margin also has slightly decreased from 2.53% in December 2020 to 2.35% in March.

Other Operating Income
The economic activities have been operating uninterrupted to a large extent during the current period compared with the comparative period which involved a stringent lockdown situation. The bank was able to use the opportunities created in the market with a concentrated effort to increase non-funded business and the effort was rewarded with an increase of fee and commission income to Rs. 651 million for the quarter ended 31 March from Rs. 548 million in the comparative period.
Other operating income has increased mainly due to increase in Dividend income and gain on sale of fixed income securities during the period ended 31 March.

Impairment Charge on Loans and Other Losses
Impairment provision has decreased to Rs. 356 million for the quarter ended 31 March from Rs. 637 million in the comparable period. While maintaining the same provision level for loans and advances to customers, impairment charge over other financial assets was reduced due to the reduction in loss ratio related to the Government securities denominated in foreign currencies as per a guideline issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
In order to address the potential future impacts of COVID-19 on the lending portfolio, the bank has made adequate impairment provision as at 31 December 2020 by introducing changes to internal models to cover unseen risk factors in the highly uncertain and volatile environment including additional provisions made for the exposures to risk elevated sectors. The same methods and the processes were followed during the quarter ended 31 March as there is no material change to the operating environment. 
The bank reported the NPL ratio of 5.53% in March compared to 5.56% in December 2020. As the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to be felt for some time, the Bank continues to closely monitor its loan portfolio and provisioning levels.

Operating Expenses
During the quarter ended 31 March, operating expenses increased from Rs. 1,751 million to Rs. 2,031 million compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. Staff related provisions for year 2019 which were not utilised were reversed during the period ended 31 March 2020 and if not for such reversal the increase in total operating expenses would have been only 6% during the quarter ended 31 March compared with the comparative period of year 2020. 
During the year the bank created multiple channels for service delivery for customer’s access and provided uninterrupted services during the pandemic situation which resulted in increasing IT related cost and other operating expenses. Close monitoring and effective cost control measures adopted during the period helped to maintain the operating expenses at these levels.

Other Comprehensive Income
Investments in equity securities and treasury bills and bonds (fixed income securities) are classified as financial assets and the change in fair value is recorded through other comprehensive income. Accordingly, fair value gain of Rs. 534 million and a net fair value loss of Rs. 1,131 million were recorded on account of equity and fixed income securities, respectively. 
The increase in the share price of Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC during the period mainly contributed to the reported fair value gain in equity securities, whilst the movement of interest rates of treasury bills and bonds unfavourably resulted in the fair value loss that was recorded during the period.

Business growth
Despite the challenging business environment, the bank continued its growth strategy by increasing both deposit and loan portfolio as at 31 March. The loan portfolio grew by Rs. 12,652 million to record Rs. 314,562 million compared to Rs. 301,909 million as at 31 December 2020 recording an increase of 4%. The bank’s deposit base also experienced a growth of 1% recording an increase of Rs. 2,059 million to Rs. 312,086 million from Rs. 310,027 million as at 31 December 2020.
With the 1% increase in deposits and 4% increase in loans, DFCC Bank reported loan to deposit ratio of 101%. The bank’s CASA ratio, which represents the proportion of low cost deposits in the total deposits of the bank was 30.06% as at 31 March 2021. Funding costs for DFCC Bank were also contained due to access to medium to long-term concessionary credit lines. 
When these concessionary term borrowings are considered, the ratio improved to 35.94% as at 31 March. DFCC Bank continued its approach to tap local and foreign currency related long to medium-term borrowing opportunities. DFCC Bank’s total assets and total liabilities slightly decreased by 1% from December 2020 mainly due to the strategy followed by the Bank for utilising the excess funds to settle high cost short term borrowings.

Equity and compliance with capital requirements
The bank has declared a final dividend of Rs. 3.00 per share in the form of a scrip dividend for the year ended 31 December 2020, balancing the expectations of shareholders with business plans including the credit growth of the bank. In order to support future growth as a full-service retail bank, the bank has consistently maintained a capital ratio above the Basel III minimum capital requirements. 
As at 31 March, the bank has recorded Tier 1 and total capital adequacy ratios of 10.21% and 14.52%, respectively, which is well above the minimum regulatory requirements of 8% and 12% including Capital Conservation buffer of 2%. The bank’s Net Stable Funding Ratio was 117.41%, well above the regulator mandated minimum of 90%. These strong capital adequacy and liquidity levels are clear affirmation of the bank’s stability.
The DFCC Group comprises of DFCC Bank PLC (DFCC), and its subsidiaries – Lanka Industrial Estates Ltd., (LINDEL), DFCC Consulting Ltd., (DCPL) and Synapsys Ltd., (SL), the joint venture company – Acuity Partners Ltd., (APL) and associate company – National Asset Management Ltd., (NAMAL).

Siyapatha Finance PLC, a fully-owned subsidiary of Sampath Bank PLC has introduced a special leasing package for small, medium and large-scale farmers and entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector. The primary objective of this leasing offer is to enable members of the agricultural industry to purchase new equipment or upgrade existing machinery.
Having recognised the importance of the agricultural sector to the Sri Lankan economy, Siyapatha Finance has taken steps towards facilitating a hassle-free approach for farmers and entrepreneurs in the agricultural industry. The special leasing package offers lower instalment payments, flexible repayment facilities on a monthly or seasonal basis, and hassle-free quick approvals with minimal documents. 
These low instalment payments and flexible repayment facilities have been implemented to ease the financial burdens on farmers. By not enforcing stringent repayment conditions, it encourages farmers to make the investment with flexible payment terms. With the added rapidity in issuing approvals, less time is consumed and overall efficiency of the process and convenience to farmers increases. 
Siyapatha Finance Managing Director Ananda Seneviratne commented, “Our country relies heavily on the agricultural sector and many farmers find it difficult to upgrade their machinery or invest in new machinery owing to financial hurdles. We recognised this issue and took steps to enable an easy way for them to proceed with their operations through our special Agri Lease package. At the end of the day, we put the best interests of the Sri Lankan people at the forefront of our minds and in doing so aim to facilitate continuous development and progress.” 
The multiple benefits of this scheme provide an overall easy and convenient application process which makes this leasing scheme, offered by Siyapatha Finance PLC, one of the most promising schemes for those who are in the agricultural sector.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) yesterday launched an Asia Pacific Tax Hub to create an open and inclusive platform to promote strategic policy dialogue, improve knowledge sharing, and strengthen coordination on tax policy and administration among ADB, its members, and development partners.
The hub will maximise regional and international resources to strengthen domestic resource mobilisation (DRM) and international tax cooperation (ITC) in ADB’s developing member countries (DMCs).
“Domestic resource mobilisation has emerged as a major strategic priority for our DMCs at this moment. It will be vital in the effort to address debt sustainability and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,” ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa said in a seminar at ADB’s 54th Annual Meeting. “The lack of a pan-regional tax community has been a unique and significant shortcoming for Asia and the Pacific. To address this, I would like to announce today the official launch of the Asia Pacific Tax Hub.” 
The hub will support DMCs on three main building blocks: preparation of medium-term revenue strategies (MTRS); roadmaps for the automation of tax administration, and proactive participation in international tax initiatives.
The hub aims to play a key role in these agendas by stimulating regional dialogue and knowledge sharing on needed reforms. Through the hub, ADB will:

coordinate closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support DMCs as they formulate country-specific MTRS, with activities such as regional workshops in collaboration with the Platform for Collaboration on Tax and diagnostic tools like the Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool;
conduct needs assessments to prepare roadmaps for the automation of tax administrations in DMCs, and support their implementation in collaboration with development partners and leading countries in this area;
facilitate policy dialogue with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and stimulate proactive participation of DMCs in the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes;

Fitch Ratings said yesterday it has assigned Capital Alliance Investment Grade Fund a National Fund Credit Quality Rating of ‘Af(lka)’ and a National Fund Market Risk Sensitivity Rating of ‘S1(lka)’. The fund is managed by Capital Alliance Investments Ltd. 
The ‘Af(lka)’ National Fund Credit Quality Rating is driven by the high underlying credit quality of the fund’s invested portfolio, as measured on the Sri Lankan national scale, also taking into consideration the fund’s investment guidelines. 
The ‘S1(lka)’ National Fund Market Risk Sensitivity Rating is driven by the fund’s low sensitivity to interest rate and spread risk. 
The ‘Af(lka)’ National Fund Credit Quality Rating considers both the fund’s actual and prospective credit quality. The fund’s weighted-average rating factor (WARF), Fitch’s proprietary measure of fund credit risk, was 0.95 as of end-February 2021. This fell within the ‘AAf(lka) rating range of 0.3-1.0, although the fund’s WARF varied over the six months to end-February between the ‘AAf(lka)’ and ‘Af(lka)’ ranges. The fund’s investment guidelines allow it both to extend duration from current levels and increase exposure to lower-rated, albeit still investment grade issuers. Therefore, Fitch has chosen to assign a rating of ‘Af(lka)’ to reflect the fund’s through-the-cycle credit profile. 
A fund’s WARF is a function of the credit ratings of the securities held in a fund’s portfolio and their remaining term to maturity, weighted by market value. Fitch bases the WARF on Fitch ratings where available but can consider other ratings where appropriate. 
The National Fund Market Risk Sensitivity rating is driven by the fund’s low sensitivity to interest-rate and spread risk. The fund’s Market Risk Factor (MRF) was 0.93 as of end-February, which was well within the ‘S1(lka)’ rating range of 0.0-2.0. The MRF was consistently within this range for the six months ending February and the fund’s investment guidelines provided effective constraint on the ability of the fund to materially increase interest rate or spread duration. 
The fund is an open-end fixed income fund that invests in Government securities and (national scale) investment-grade corporate debt. The fund seeks to obtain a high level of current income, targeting a competitive return consistent with liquidity and preservation of capital. The fund offers daily dealing with T+3 settlement. 
The fund was launched in August 2013 and is domiciled in Sri Lanka (CCC). The fund is authorised and regulated by the Sri Lankan Securities and Exchanges Commission. The fund’s assets are segregated with the trustee, Deutsche Bank AG, Colombo Branch, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG (BBB/Positive/F2). The fund’s total assets under management were Rs. 35 billion at end-March. 
Fitch views Capital Alliance Investments as a suitably qualified, competent and capable investment manager for the fund. The manager was founded in 2011 and is majority owned by Capital Alliance Ltd. with a minority holding by Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. (National Insurer Financial Strength: AA(lka)/Stable). The manager was the second-largest investment manager in Sri Lanka as of end-December 2020, with a market share of about 23%. Capital Alliance Investments had total assets under management of Rs. 73.8 billion as of end-March, of which Rs. 52.5 billion was in unit trust funds. 
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade: 
The National Fund Credit Quality Rating could be upgraded if the fund adjusted its investment guidelines to focus only on higher quality securities. The National Fund Market Risk Sensitivity Rating is already at the highest possible rating level and therefore cannot be upgraded. 
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade: 
The National Fund Credit Quality Rating could be downgraded if the portfolio suffered material negative rating migration or if the fund expanded its investment guidelines to allow it to invest in lower quality securities. The rating could also be sensitive to increased exposure to non-Fitch rated securities where Fitch may have more conservative credit views than other rating agencies. The National Fund Market Risk Sensitivity Rating could be downgraded if the fund’s investment guidelines changed to allow it to assume increased duration risk.

Return on Equity improves from 14.36% to 19.27%
Loans and Advances book reaches Rs. 135 b and Customer Deposits reach Rs. 142 b
Net Non-Performing Advances Ratio improves from 2.34% to 2.18 % due to prudent provisioning


Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC said yesterday reported the best-ever first quarter financial results during the quarter ended 31 March 2021 to report a Pre-Tax Profit of Rs. 986 million and a Post-Tax Profit of Rs. 750 million after recording impressive growth rates of 51% and 81% respectively, demonstrating the resilience amidst challenging macro-economic conditions. 
The bank’s performance was characterised by strength and resilience, despite the heightened uncertainty due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 impact on the Sri Lankan economy, the bank’s Operating Profits before VAT on Financial Services reached Rs. 1,197 million with an increase of 47%, reflecting excellence in core banking performance and the success of cost containment measures evidenced by improvement in all key matrices which now rank among the industry bests. This feat was achieved even after setting aside provisions for probable loan losses amounting to Rs. 638 million. 
The bank increased the provision buffers for probable deterioration in credit quality through management overlays, experience adjustments and adjustments for the exposures in the elevated risk industries during the quarter. As a result, total impairment charges for the quarter increased by 21% on YoY basis.
The bank’s Net Interest Income for the period witnessed an increase of 17% due to significant reduction in financial cost of funds at a rate faster than the drop in interest yields of interest bearing assets. Consequently, the bank’s Net Interest Margin for the quarter improved to 5.07% from 4.41% reported three months ago. 
In the meantime, the bank’s Net Fee and Commission Income recorded a growth of 28% with the rebound in demand for credit due to revival of economic activity amidst the low interest rate regime. The volatility in foreign exchange rates enabled the bank to increase its Foreign Exchange Income substantially as reflected in Other Operating Income.
The bank is committed to revenue maximisation and cost management despite sector vulnerabilities that prevailed since last year. The bank’s Cost-to-Income Ratio improved from 45.66% to 38.08% within a three months period owing to the excellence in core banking performance which is reflected in the noteworthy overall growth in key revenue lines and various strategies and measures taken to contain overhead costs. In fact, the bank managed to bring down its Other Operating Expenses by 9% in 2021 Q1 compared to 2020 Q1. Meanwhile, increased allocations for performance bonuses, development of human capital and staff welfare led to an increase in personnel costs during the reporting period compared to 2020 Q1.
The bank’s Post-Tax Profits for the reporting quarter also gained to an extent due to application of lower corporate income tax rate of 24% for tax provisioning in accordance with the guideline issued by CA Sri Lanka on 23 April 2021.
The bank continues to report solid Key Profitability Indicators which rank among the highest in the industry. The Bank’s Pre-Tax Return on Assets also improved to 2.24% from 1.70%. Further, the bank reported a stunning Return on Equity (ROE) of 19.27% during the quarter under review which stands among the industry best. The ROE is the most important performance indicator to gauge the attractiveness of the banking sector and Pan Asia Bank during its last few years has consistently remained an outlier in the industry. 
The bank’s Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the quarter rose to Rs. 1.70 in 2021 Q1 from Rs. 0.94 in 2020 Q1 driven by the excellent overall performance. Meanwhile, the bank’s Net Asset Value Per Share increased by 5% during the quarter to reach Rs. 36.58 as at 31 March 2021.
The bank’s Total Asset Base stood at Rs. 180.74 b as at 31 March 2021 after reporting a growth of over 2% during the quarter supported mainly by the expansion in the credit book.  The bank’s Gross Loans and Advances Book recorded a growth of over 3% to reach Rs. 135 b. Meanwhile Customer Deposits recorded a modest growth to reach Rs. 142 b as at 31 March 2021. The bank’s CASA Ratio remained at the 25% level as at 31 March 2021. 
The bank’s Gross Non-Performing Loan Ratio marginally slipped from 6.73% to 6.77% during the quarter amidst tough macro-economic conditions. Nevertheless, the bank’s Net Non-Performing Loan Ratio improved from 2.34% to 2.18% during Q1 2021 due to prudent provisioning.
Commenting on the financial performance, the bank’s Managing Director/CEO Nimal Tillekeratne said; “The bank was able to record this excellent performance due to proactive decisions and effective execution of strategies capitalising on the opportunities in the macro economy while managing risks. This stellar performance is a clear testament of the bank’s resiliency, foresight, agility and the growing capability to generate strong financial performance even amidst challenging conditions.” 
“This is the best-ever post-tax profits in a first quarter the bank had in our history of 25+ years. We have achieved this feat while building additional provision buffers to deal with probable deterioration in credit quality due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. This robust performance we recorded in 2021 Q1 with the key contributions from all segments are in line with the set budgets and also gives us the confidence to record even better performance going forward,” Tillekeratne added, while commending his team which made this performance possible.
The bank maintains all its Capital and Liquidity Ratios well above the regulatory minimums. The Bank’s Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Capital Ratio as at 31st March 2021 stood at 12.83% and 15.28% respectively. The bank’s Statutory Liquid Asset Ratios (SLAR) as at 31 March 2021 stood at 28.96% and 50.25% for Domestic Banking Unit and Off-Shore Banking Unit respectively. Meanwhile, the nank’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under BASEL III stood well above the statutory minimums. The bank maintained LCR Ratios of 203.95% and 173.30% for all currencies and LKR respectively.
Pan Asia Bank was crowned the ‘Fastest Growing Commercial Bank in Sri Lanka – 2021’ by International Business Magazine. Having recognised in the recent past by many local and global entities for numerous aspects of excellence in the banking sphere, this award is a great source of pride and honour for Pan Asia Bank. 
Moreover, the bank was recently bestowed with the prestigious ‘Best Bank for Treasury Activities Sri Lanka – 2021’ award by the Global Banking & Finance Awards 2021.

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has announced a significant increase in the interest rate offered to Sri Lankan Personal Foreign Currency (PFC) account holders, via the bank’s ‘FC Plus’ account.
Individuals who open an FC Plus foreign currency account at Commercial Bank will be eligible to receive an interest rate of 4.5% per annum for US Dollar deposits, the bank said.
Interest will be calculated on the daily balance and credited to customers’ accounts monthly, enabling them to earn interest on interest, resulting in their foreign currency savings growing faster than other foreign currency accounts and earning a higher return than overseas deposit rates.
The Bank said the interest rate for FC Plus accounts is linked to the LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate) – the internationally-accepted benchmark for foreign currency interest rates – and is structured so that the higher the balance, the higher the rate of interest earned. The rates are reviewed monthly.
Customers can now deposit foreign currency notes too to this account, after validating the source of funds according to the stipulated criteria, and funds can be withdrawn at any time, the Bank said.
FC Plus accounts can be opened with a minimum deposit of 5,000 in any of four foreign currencies, the US Dollar, Euro, Sterling Pound or Australian Dollar, and progressively higher rates of interest will be paid on account balances that are within the slabs of up to 50,000; 50,001-to 100,000; and above 100,001, the bank disclosed.
Commercial Bank’s FC Plus account holders are saved the hassle of maintaining a passbook, and receive periodic account statements for added flexibility and convenience. They also enjoy fast, and convenient 24x7 unlimited access to their accounts from anywhere in the world through online banking or through millions of ATMs belonging to the Cirrus or Visa networks.
The first Sri Lankan bank to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World and the only Sri Lankan bank to be so listed for 10 years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 268 branches and 932 automated machines in Sri Lanka.
The first and the only bank in Sri Lanka to achieve carbon neutral status, Commercial Bank’s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the bank operates 19 outlets; Myanmar, where it has a Microfinance company in Nay Pyi Taw; and the Maldives, where the bank has a fully-fledged Tier I bank with a majority stake.

Comprehensive package of new measures to safeguard auditor independence in relation to non-assurance services and fees paid by audit clients   

The International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) last week released revisions to the Non-Assurance Services (NAS) and fee-related provisions of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (the Code). 
The revised NAS and fee-related provisions significantly strengthen the guardrails around auditor independence in two important areas that have the potential to create incentives influencing auditor behaviour – non-assurance services provided to audit clients and fees. 
“Independence is fundamental to the role of auditors as corporate guardians and ultimately to public confidence in financial reporting and market integrity,” said IESBA Chairman Dr. Stavros Thomadakis. “With the significant strengthening of the NAS and fees provisions, we have taken bold steps to set an even higher bar for the standards of independence required of auditors globally, especially in relation to public interest entities. We believe these changes represent a major advance in the public interest.” 
The package of new measures includes: 

A far-reaching prohibition on audit firms from providing a NAS that might create a self-review threat to an audit client that is a public interest entity
New provisions to enable and promote more robust engagement between auditors and those charged with governance of public interest entities about independence matters relating to NAS and fees
Strengthened provisions to address undue fee dependency on audit clients
Provisions to stimulate greater public transparency about fees paid by audit clients that are public interest entities to assist stakeholder judgments about auditor independence

Comprehensive guidance to steer auditors’ threat assessments and actions in relation to NAS and fees
“The revised NAS and fee-related provisions reflect current public interest expectations with respect to auditor independence in two important areas,” said IESBA Consultative Advisory Group (CAG) Chair Gaylen Hansen. “The IESBA CAG, with its diverse membership base, has unanimously supported and encouraged the IESBA’s formidable leadership in effecting these changes.” 
The revised NAS and fee-related provisions have been informed by extensive research, global roundtables and other outreach to investors, the corporate governance community, regulators, audit oversight bodies, national standard setters, accounting firms, preparers of financial statements, and others. In addition, the development of the provisions has benefited from close coordination with the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). 
The revised NAS and fee-related provisions become effective for audits of financial statements for periods beginning on or after 15 December 2022. Early adoption is permitted and encouraged. 
In support of global adoption and implementation of the new standards, the IESBA has developed Bases for Conclusions and other resources which are available on the IESBA’s website. Additional support materials and resources will be published in 2021.

Posts first-quarter net income of $ 333 million, driven by strong underlying performance of all businesses

Swiss Re has reported a Group net income of $ 333 million in the first quarter of 2021, as the strong underlying performance of all businesses more than offset losses related to COVID-19 ($ 643 million) and large natural catastrophes ($ 426 million). Excluding COVID-19-related claims and reserves, Swiss Re’s net income was $ 843 million.
Swiss Re’s Group Chief Executive Officer Christian Mumenthaler said: “The start of 2021 has seen record numbers of COVID-19-related deaths in many countries, and our thoughts go out to those who have lost a loved one. The devastating human toll of the pandemic is also reflected in the financial results of Swiss Re as the world’s largest life and health reinsurer. As we continue to support our clients and communities affected by the pandemic, the underlying performance of all our businesses remains very strong and underpins our confidence.”
Swiss Re’s Group Chief Financial Officer John Dacey said: “The return to profitability this quarter in our property and casualty businesses underlines the earnings potential of our diversified business model. We effectively absorbed the heightened mortality impact on our life and health business and maintained a very strong capital position.”
Swiss Re achieved a strong ROI of 3.5% in the first quarter of 2021. The investment result was driven largely by recurring income supplemented by gains from equity valuations. The result reflected an effective balance of active management and preservation of sustainable income.
P&C Re reported a net income of $ 477 million in the first quarter, up significantly from $ 61 million in the same period last year. This is the result of continued price improvements and disciplined underwriting, which also contained the large natural catastrophe losses of $ 316 million, primarily relating to US winter storms. Excluding COVID-19 impacts, P&C Re’s net income was $ 509 million.
P&C Re’s net premiums earned increased by 5.7% to $ 5 billion, driven by strong new business growth in 2020, which continues to earn through in 2021.
The ROE was 21.6% and the combined ratio was 96.5%, despite higher-than-expected natural catastrophe losses as well as COVID-19 impacts. As a result of improving margins, P&C Re is on track to achieve its normalised1 combined ratio estimate of less than 95% in 2021.
In April 2021, P&C Re renewed treaty contracts with $ 2.6 billion in premium volume. This represents a 20% increase in volume compared with the business that was up for renewal, reflecting attractive transaction opportunities and pricing. P&C Re achieved a nominal price increase of 4% in this renewal round, more than offsetting lower interest rates and higher loss assumptions.
L&H Re continued to see significant COVID-19-related losses of $ 570 million, driven by high mortality rates in the US and other countries, and reported a net loss of $ 184 million for the first quarter of 2021.
In the US, the first three months of 2021 saw the highest mortality since the start of the pandemic, with more than 200 000 reported deaths from COVID-19. Since March, the average daily mortality has significantly declined as vaccination efforts progress.
Excluding COVID-19 claims and reserves, L&H Re’s underlying business achieved very strong results, with a net income of $ 270 million and an ROE of 16.8%. This was supported by a strong underwriting performance across all regions and favourable investment results.
Net premiums earned and fee income increased by 13.8% to $ 3.8 billion, primarily driven by longevity transactions in the EMEA region.
For the first quarter of 2021, Corporate Solutions reported a net income of $ 96 million, compared with a net loss of $ 166 million in the prior-year period2, reflecting a continuation of the successful turnaround achieved in 2020 and the diminishing impact of COVID-19-related losses. Excluding the COVID-19-related impacts, net income was $ 112 million.
Net premiums earned remained stable at $ 1.2 billion, as realised rate increases and growth in selected areas offset the impact of previous portfolio pruning measures. The strong pricing momentum experienced in 2020 continued in the first quarter of 2021, with Corporate Solutions achieving risk-adjusted price increases of 13%3.
The ROE amounted to 16.2% and the combined ratio was 96.0%, despite higher-than-expected natural catastrophe losses of $ 110 million. As a result of disciplined underwriting, strict expense management and continued rate increases, the Business Unit is on track to achieve its targeted normalised4 combined ratio of less than 97% in 2021.
iptiQ continued its strong track record of growth in the first quarter of 2021. Compared with the same period last year, gross premiums written for the core business rose by 150% to $ 167 million, as iptiQ expanded its property and casualty business in the EMEA region.
Swiss Re’s Group Chief Executive Officer Christian Mumenthaler said: “We have seen a solid start to 2021 and expect all our businesses to continue delivering a strong underlying performance with diminishing COVID-19 losses. I am particularly encouraged by the improving profitability in our property and casualty businesses, supported by strong renewals year to date in improving market conditions.”

First Capital has recommended the NDB’s Rights Issue, saying it will accelerate the bank’s growth engine. 
NDB is raising Rs. 8 billion-11 billion via a Rights Issue (RI) and a private placement (PP). 
In a research report, First Capital said its previous report in February maintained the NDB share at buy with a fair value of Rs. 115.0 for 2021E, considering the fact that the successful subscription of the Rights Issue (RI) may support the NDB’s lending growth while also addressing its capital concerns.  
It said the Corporate Update assumed a right issue amount of Rs. 8.0 billion. However, with the announcement published by NDB in March, NDB announced a RI and PP potentially raising a maximum of Rs. 11.0 billion.  
With the proposed RI, NDB expects to issue up to 106.8 million of shares in the proportion of 28:61 at a price of Rs. 75.0 per share raising up to Rs. 8.0 billion. Norfund, the Norwegian Investment Fund has expressed interest to subscribe for any undersubscribed shares at a price of Rs. 75.0 and/or subscribe for voting shares at a price of Rs. 82.5 by way of a private placement. 
The maximum shares to be issued under private placement would be 37.7 million shares amounting to a maximum of Rs. 3.1 billion and private placement will only take place in the event Norfund doesn’t secure maximum 9.99% via the RI. The capital raised through the issue will provide sufficient buffer for the NDB with its growth plans while maintaining adequate levels of capital. However, on a conservative basis we have estimated only Rs. 10.0 billion will be raised through the RI and PP. 
First Capital said NDB intends to utilise the entire proceeds of the fund raising to expand its loan book in the ordinary course of business including continued expansion of its micro/SMEs portfolios. Accordingly, as mentioned in the Corporate Update, First Capital expects NDB to record a loan growth of 14% in 2021E and 2022E above the private sector credit growth expectation of 12%. 
Moreover, in the short term NDB expects to invest any unutilised proceeds in either one or a combination of Govt. Securities, deposits in LCBs and Money Market funds generating a minimum return equivalent to the prevailing overnight REPO rate until such funds are utilised for lending. Accordingly, First Capital expects margins to slightly improve in the short-term, thus enhancing the bottom line. 
“We expect successful subscription of the RI to alleviate the capital concerns and enhance the lending growth of NDB. We have slightly increased the earnings target for NDB for 2021E and for 2022E at Rs. 6.9 billion and Rs. 8.4 billion while Fair Value is estimated at Rs. 110.0 due to the dilution of shares with the additional funds that will be raised through the PP. Maintain buy and subscribe for Rights,” First Capital added.

George Steuart Insurance Brokers Ltd. Managing Director Joachim Caspersz in this wide-ranging interview expands on the concept and effectiveness of insurance brokering in Sri Lanka, with an overall outlook on the insurance industry. Caspersz is a seasoned veteran, having spent over 40 years working in and representing the industry while heading several leading insurance brokering companies, alongside being director of a leading corporate in Sri Lanka. Following are excerpts:
 






George Steuart Insurance Brokers Managing Director Joachim Caspersz

 




Q: The insurance industry appears to be doing well, despite the challenging environment. Do you agree?
This is not quite so. The industry is facing multiple challenges, some of them critical. For a number of years, claim ratios of the overall general insurance market have hovered around 65%. That is, for each Rs. 100 that the insurers charge as premium, they pay out Rs. 65 as claims. If you add management overheads and other expenses to this figure, it does not take much to realise that operating margins are thin or non-existent. If you add to this, the low interest rates (which impact investment income) and the lack of growth in the market, you begin to realise the scale of the problem. 
In addition, the reinsurance market has changed dramatically over the last few months. Reinsurance is the mechanism where insurance companies protect themselves against the risks that they accept from customers, by sharing that risk with specialised reinsurance companies. Consequent to COVID-19, the reinsurance market has changed with a reduction in the number of players and those that remain, restricting terms and charging far higher rates than they did before. 
The net result is that rates of premiums will increase significantly, terms will be restricted and there will be a tighter control of claims. In some cases, insurance coverage may not be possible at all. On top of all this, the economic environment is not conducive to growth and the market is facing negative growth. We are witnessing the makings of a perfect storm. 
The insurance industry – insurers, brokers and agents, responded very well to the challenges of doing business in a COVID-19 environment, rapidly adapting to technology to continue to deliver services to clients. However, these measures, as innovative as they are, do not negate the challenges now facing the industry.    

Q:  So what is the role of the insurance broker in this environment? 
 The use of an insurance broker is now more important than ever before. An insurance broker represents the interests of the client (corporate or individual) to the insurer. As a professional in the field of insurance, the insurance broker brings its considerable expertise (on par with those of the insurer) to the disposal of the client. 
To be able to advise a client, you need to understand his/her business, its inner workings and how insurance can help economically transfer risk. The broker does this. Therefore, as a broker, one has a wide spectrum of involvement from an individual’s personal requirement to the complex risks of a corporate entity. Moreover, the broker will also help in the handling and negotiation of claims when they occur, which is an important aspect in the insurance transaction. 
Insurance brokering is an essential link in the insurance transaction. The relationship between the insurer and the person/entity purchasing insurance can be one sided. The insurer knows intimate details of the insurance policy and how the mechanism of insurance works. The purchaser has at best, a rudimentary grasp of insurance. The insurance broker rights this imbalance – at no cost to the purchaser. 
An insurance broker has a team supporting its operations, made up of members who have an intimate and thorough knowledge of the inner workings of the insurance industry. These members have sound relationships with all local insurers and frequently international partnerships as well. All of this is at the disposal of the client. 
Currently, insurance brokers are involved in the General Insurance (non-life) segment of the market and command a market share of about 25%. Many corporates and more than a few individuals use the services of a broker. 
Given the challenges already outlined, clients need the services of an insurance broker now more than ever, to help navigate what is going to be a very choppy environment for insurance. 

Q:  Does the use of an insurance broker add cost to the client?
 It does not. As practiced in Sri Lanka, insurance brokers do not charge fees from their clients. The insurance companies pay the broker based on business placed with them. Even if an insurer deals with a client directly, there is a cost to the insurer in inter-phasing with the client, marketing, servicing, technical support, claims and so on. Most of these aspects are taken over by the broker and therefore the insurer does save a considerable portion of these costs when a broker is involved. 
In fact, one of the key elements in the role of the insurance broker is to save money for the client whilst ensuring as wide coverage as possible. 

Q:  Are the challenges the insurance industry faces in Sri Lanka the same as those faced in developed markets?
 There are similarities as well as differences. Given the current economic climate, the issues of tighter reinsurance, challenging growth rates, falling rates of interest and claim ratios are the same all over the world. Significant differences would include the lack of choice in our market due to a reduction in the number of insurers, lack of capacity (ability to take on large and specialised risks) and the relatively low percentage of customers using brokers. 
If you look at large impact risks which corporates in general face, commonality of risks exists for pandemics, climate change and weather related risks, cyber, terrorism, social issues, and so on. Here in Sri Lanka, we also have issues with economic uncertainty, credit risk, HR and talent management, and regulatory compliance. 

Q:  There was a recent legal judgment regarding the functioning of overseas brokers in Sri Lanka. What is your take on the matter? 
 The legislation in Sri Lanka mandates that any insurer or broker or agent who chooses to operate in Sri Lanka must be registered by the insurance regulator. Additionally, the legislation also says that insurance may only be purchased from an insurer and through a broker or agent registered to operate in our market. The courts have upheld this legislation, as they should. None of us can go to India or the UK and set up office there and start business without a registration process.  
However, insurers have an issue as reinsurance business is handled by overseas based insurance and reinsurance brokers who are not registered in our market. The matter can be resolved if such brokers get themselves locally registered or operate through locally registered brokers. Another possible solution is to strengthen the National Insurance Trust Fund which acts as a reinsurance entity in Sri Lanka so that it is better able to support the local insurers.  
The regulator is currently looking into this matter and I am sure a practical solution will be found to the satisfaction of all concerned. 

Q:  What are the challenges to insurance brokers? 
 The core challenge facing insurance brokers is the rise of informal channels in the market. This includes banks, finance and leasing companies, car dealers, even travel agents (in their heyday). As insurers strive to expand their footprint, these channels are used to reach mass market and expand distribution. The issue is that many of these arrangements operate outside the existing legislation and apart from acting as distribution channels, do not add any value to the purchaser of insurance. 
Insurance brokers by and large are not against these channels. All that is being asked is that they conform to the legislation (to be registered as an agent, a broker, etc.). Additionally, some of these arrangements force the purchase of the insurance policy by the client with choice removed from the transaction. Brokers are requesting that these “forced” sales (which are banned in most developed markets) be removed and choice provided to the purchaser.         
The second issue facing brokers (which is perhaps linked to the first issue) is finding ways and means of broad basing distribution. Here, the challenge is that the commissions paid to the broker are frequently significantly less than what are paid to these informal channels on a direct basis by the insurers. Whilst we wait on regulator involvement in the matter coupled with market consensus, the immediate solution is the use of technology. This calls for heavy investment by the broker but will probably pay off in the medium to long term. 

Q:  What of the future of the insurance industry in Sri Lanka?
 Despite the challenges I’ve outlined, the insurance industry in Sri Lanka is vibrant and innovative and, arguably, coupled with a good regulatory environment, strongly placed to grow in relevance. Try and envision an environment without insurance and you will understand what I mean.  
There will be an increase in use of technology. Digital disruption will be the norm rather than the exception. This has already commenced as a result of the impact of COVID19, with greater adoption of online interaction with clients, the use of apps, sale and purchase of products online, the use of AI, more detailed and focus on analysis and big data, and so on. Claim settlement too will move into the virtual space. The industry will become more effective in the retail segment with a greater engagement and innovation as it seeks to increase its diffusion rate (gross premiums as a percentage of GDP). Expect to see insurance products sold along with your supermarket purchases or when you top up on fuel at your petrol shed. There will be an emphasis on service differentiation rather than product differentiation.    
For the insurance broker this environment is going to be extra challenging. As insurers move into the retail space, they will develop even more informal channels than exist currently. Brokers who oppose, or worse, ignore this fact do so at their peril. Insurance brokers will evolve to be more risk advisors rather than channels.

Q:  Insurance seems to have crisis of negative perception. Your comments?
 This is manifestly true. Recently a friend of mine referred to us as dour, grey-haired men who take life too seriously whilst a venerable senior politician once referred to insurance as a ‘Mahattaya’ type business needing change. The average person’s experience with insurance has been bad in terms of the heaviness of the transaction and the bureaucracy and fine print when a claim occurs. It appears to be as interesting as an egg sandwich – arguably essential because there is no alternative in sight.
I believe this image is changing with the advent of technology and as players (insurers and brokers) try to position insurance and the transaction of it as a 21st century essential service. One hopes though that we do not replace the egg sandwich with the image of a burger.

The exchange rates of Asia-Pacific's largest economies proved resilient against the dollar throughout the coronavirus pandemic crisis and the recent rise in US bond yields and should make further gains in the coming months, says Fitch Ratings in a new report.
The region's currencies have been supported by China's strong economic recovery, particularly the Australian dollar and Korean won, while high commodity prices have provided tailwinds for the Australian dollar and Indonesian rupiah. Lower external imbalances in Indonesia and India have better supported the countries' currencies during the recent episode of market volatility relative to the sell-off in 2013.
Fitch’s empirical analysis – based on estimating ‘fair value’ models for six major Asian currencies against the dollar – also shows that, historically, most Asian currencies have been more sensitive to US short-term interest rates rather that longer-term US bond yields. The rupiah stands out as being the most sensitive to rising US long-term bond yields.
With the Fed likely to keep the short-end of the US yield curve firmly entrenched at its current low level, it thinks that most Asian currencies have scope for small gains in coming months, having already regained some ground in recent weeks, following the February-March sell off.
Downside risks to its currency forecasts include much higher US inflation pressure than it expects, prompting a faster-than-anticipated rise in US yields and a strong broad-based dollar appreciation trend.
Fitch projects exchange rates each quarter for 20 large economies, which are published in its Global Economic Outlook. This report aims at a better understanding of exchange-rate drivers and to inform of its forecasts. Exchange-rate forecasts feed into our broad macro and ratings analysis.

REUTERS: Mastercard Inc. reported a steep drop in overseas spending on its cards due to the pandemic that overshadowed a first-quarter profit beat, sending the payments processor's shares down more than 2%.
Cross-border volume, a key measure that tracks spending on cards beyond the country of issue, tumbled 17% globally for Mastercard from travel curbs and border restrictions to fight the health crisis. That compared to an 11% fall at rival Visa Inc.
“The biggest headwind for Mastercard continues to be cross-border volumes,” Brett Horn, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in a client note.
The fees that MasterCard collects from such transactions declined 23%, with intra-Europe cross-border volumes falling 11%.
The company, however, struck an optimistic tone for domestic travel.
“We expect domestic travel to improve progressively throughout the year in countries with strong vaccination programs,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Miebach said.
Payment companies are set to see an uptick in volumes as speedy vaccine rollouts unleash pent-up demand.
US airline spending doubled over the last four weeks relative to where it was earlier in the quarter, Mastercard Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra said.
Mastercard reported a return to top line growth for the first time in four quarters. Net revenue grew 4% to $ 4.2 billion from last year, also beating estimates of $ 3.99 billion.
The company also processed more transactions in the first three months of the year, spurred by US Government stimulus and vaccinations.
Gross dollar volumes, which represents the dollar value of the transactions processed, rose 8% on a local currency basis from a year earlier.
The company reported an adjusted profit of 1.74 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $ 1.57, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

One in every five rating actions that Fitch Ratings took on global financial institutions (FIs) in 1Q21 led to a rating Outlook revision to Stable from Negative, signalling that near-term ratings risks are easing. However, downside risks remain, including potential further coronavirus waves, weakened sovereign credit profiles and an economic fallout as governments gradually withdraw pandemic-related economic support.
Of the 317 rating actions taken on global FIs between 1 January and 31 March, 66% led to unchanged ratings and Outlooks, while 20% led to Outlook revisions to Stable from Negative. Only 11% of rating actions were negative, evenly split between downgrades and Outlook revisions to Negative.
Banks had the highest proportion of negative rating actions in 1Q21, reflecting sovereign rating actions and weakening standalone credit profiles. Non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) downgrades reflected a mix of downgrades of corporate parents, sovereigns, standalone credit weaknesses and M&A.
The proportion of global FI ratings on Negative Outlook or Watch continues to decline but remains high by historical standards despite the mitigating macroeconomic effects of fiscal and monetary stimulus, with 54% of bank ratings, 33% of NBFI ratings and 24% of insurance ratings on Negative Outlook or Watch at end-1Q21.
“We expect stabilisation trends over the rest of 2021 to vary by region due to contrasting speeds of economic recovery and different degrees of exposure to the sectors most affected by the pandemic,” Fitch said. Several FI ratings are sensitive to the pressure that remains on some sovereign ratings, particularly in emerging markets, and on those corporate sectors and asset classes worst affected by the pandemic, such as leisure and hospitality, it added.

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has won three prestigious awards – the ‘Best Private Bank’ in Sri Lanka in 2021’, the ‘Best Digital Transformation in Banking’ and ‘Best Mobile Banking Application’ –from Business Tabloid Magazine, a leading business magazine of the UK. 
The Commercial Bank was the only bank to win three awards in the Banking category and was honoured alongside contemporaries such as Deutsche Bank in the Philippines, the Emirates Islamic Bank of UAE, the MBSB Bank in Malaysia, and the Gulf Bank in Kuwait. 
This is the third time Commercial Bank has been recognised by Business Tabloid. In 2020, the bank was presented the award for the ‘Most Innovative Banking Services in Sri Lanka’ and in 2019 was adjudged the ‘Most Innovative Commercial Bank in Sri Lanka.’
In the digital sphere, ‘ComBank Digital’ offered through a responsive web application and two native mobile applications, enables access to the bank’s services across all devices such as desktop PCs, laptop computers, tabs, and smartphones. 
It consists of internationally recognised user security features with industry standards and a range of facilities including services such as checking balances of Current Accounts, Savings Accounts, Investments, Loans, and Credit Card accounts and transactional activities such as applying for Fixed Deposits, instant payments across the banking network, and share trading settlements.
Meanwhile, ‘Flash’, Commercial Bank’s fully-fledged digital bank account, enables customers to enjoy a complete suite of financial services and wealth management tools in one seamless application. 
This ground-breaking digital banking app was also recently equipped with a Quick Response Payment module that enables users to scan a LANKAQR code of any merchant to make payments directly from the account to the merchant for goods or services purchased. It also includes the revolutionary ‘Save the Environment’ feature that promotes an understanding of the social carbon footprint of consumption by assessing each transaction a user carries out via the app.

Demand at primary auctions reduces considerably
Money market remains liquid


By Wealth Trust Securities

The overall activity in the secondary bond market moderated once again during the shortened trading week ending 30 April with most market participants opting to be on the sidelines, leading to a bearish sentiment. 
Limited trades were witnessed on the maturities of 15.10.21, 2022’s (i.e. 01.10.22 and 15.12.22), 15.01.23, 15.07.23, 15.10.26, 01.08.26 and 2027’s (i.e. 15.01.27 & 15.10.27) at levels of 5.15% to 5.18%, 5.95% to 6.03%, 6.00%, 6.45% to 6.50%, 7.40% to 7.42% and 7.83% to 7.90% respectively.

Reuters: Standard Chartered PLC is to reduce its global branch network by half to around 400 to cut long-term costs after the British bank reported a stronger than expected first-quarter profit.
The Asia, Africa and Middle East-focused lender, which had as many as 1,200 branches worldwide in 2014, said on Thursday it will shrink the network to a third of that total as it also gives up office space worldwide.
“Those markets that are higher on branch numbers we’ll be looking at more closely,” StanChart’s CFO Andy Halford told reporters, without giving more details, beyond noting branch numbers in the lender’s most profitable market Hong Kong were modest.
The cost-cutting drive came as StanChart posted an 18% increase in first-quarter pre-tax profit, beginning a recovery from the economic hit caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Pre-tax profit for January-March was $1.4 billion, versus $1.2 billion a year earlier, and compared with an average analyst forecast of $1.08 billion compiled by the British bank.
The improvement was driven by StanChart setting aside less cash to cover bad loans than it had done one year ago, as well as strong performance in its wealth management business.

Long-term profitability
The move to cut branches, as well as previously announced plans to trim a third of the bank’s office space worldwide, show how StanChart is looking past short-term improvements in its results to tackle long-standing profitability challenges.
Like those of bigger rival HSBC, StanChart’s results showed how rock-bottom interest rates globally are squeezing banks’ profits, with its cash management division - usually a steady earner - seeing income fall 32%.
StanChart said it expected income to be similar this year to 2020, and to grow more the following year as fee-based businesses offset those being crushed by low interest rates.
One bright spot for StanChart was its often underperforming wealth management business, which had a record quarter with income up 21% on strong sales of foreign exchange and equities-related products.
Halford also confirmed that StanChart would have a look at the businesses rival Citi (has put up for sale, since some were in markets where the bank already had operations, though said it was too early to decide which.
Citi said earlier this month it would withdraw from consumer banking in 13, mostly Asian markets, and Reuters reported, citing sources that StanChart as well as DBS and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group are among the potential bidders.  Standard Chartered shares rose more than 2% in London, among the strongest performers in the benchmark FTSE index and echoing earlier gains in its Hong Kong shares.
Last year, the bank pushed back its long-standing profitability goal of reaching a return on tangible equity of 10%, as it increased charges for bad loans due to the economic damage following the COVID-19 pandemic.
Unlike other British-based lenders such as HSBC and Lloyds that reported earlier this week, StanChart did not release a hefty chunk of the cash it set aside to cover bad loans, instead taking a further $20 million charge in the first quarter.
This, however, was down $354 million from the previous quarter and $936 million from the year-ago period.

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has announced that ComBank Q+ Payment App, the first Quick Response (QR) based payment app to be launched on the LANKAQR platform, is now being used by over 50,000 customers who have embraced the convenience and security of the cashless digital payment solution offered by the bank. 
The app went through a series of upgrades even as the bank stepped up its promotion as part of its support to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s post-lockdown initiative to popularise QR code-based payments via LANKAQR.
ComBank Q+ Payment App was designed as a convenient and hassle-free payment alternative for Credit, Debit and Prepaid Card holders and merchants, taking them to the next dimension of digital payments, the bank said. After the launch of the app that enabled cardholders to pay for purchases via their mobile phones simply and securely by scanning the merchant’s QR code, the app underwent several functionality-enhancing upgrades. 
These included biometric authentication login for both the consumer and merchant applications, an ‘In-App Bill Payments’ feature that allows users connected to the bank’s Debit, Credit or Prepaid cards to pay bills instantly, and the facility to promptly settle Credit Card outstanding and top-up Pre-paid Cards. 
The ‘In-App Payments’ feature enables ComBank Q+ Payment App users to make payments in six categories such as data reloads, prepaid and post-paid mobiles, fixed telephone lines, utilities, water, and electricity (CEB and LECO), and pay-TV bills. 
The pervasive, dynamic and interactive user experience and convenience the app offers are the driving forces behind its popularity, the bank said. By binding their cards to the Q+ app, ComBank cardholders avoid pulling out the card from their wallets which prevents card losses and card theft. This also encourages the use of environment friendly, paperless-banking features such as Digital receipts and in-App alerts. Payments done using Q+ app require authentication using a static PIN which ensures the safety and security of transactions, making the Q+ App more secure than a normal card.
Customers can add their ComBank Visa, Mastercard and UnionPay cards to the ComBank Q+ Payment App, enabling them to perform LankaQR, mVisa, and Mastercard QR transactions. A maximum of five cards can be added to Q+ app. ComBank Q+ Payment App is the only payment app in Sri Lanka that supports LankaQR, mVisa, and Mastercard QR transactions. Moreover, the Q+ App is certified for use at overseas QR merchants through the Visa and MasterCard networks. 
Commercial Bank has continuously supported the Central Bank initiative to promote cashless digital payments via the LANKAQR platform, and in turn, popularised its Q+ application among both customers and merchants when it participated in events in Matale, at Diyatha Uyana in Colombo and in Kandy and Matara.
The first Sri Lankan bank to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World and the only Sri Lankan bank to be so listed for 10 years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 268 branches and 890 ATMs in Sri Lanka.
Commercial Bank’s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the bank operates 19 outlets; Myanmar, where it has a microfinance company in Nay Pyi Taw; and the Maldives, where the bank has a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake.

Sri Lanka’s most customer friendly bank HNB PLC, partnered Micro, Medium and Small (MSME) entrepreneurs across extensive merchant partner network to launch the HNB SOLO Avurudu Pola promoting QR-based payments at eight key locations across the island.

Users can make payments via LANKAQR by scanning the code using SOLO. Upon completion, merchants will receive an instant SMS notification, confirming the receipt of payment. 
The bank has continuously bolstered SOLO’s features and functionality while refining its user interface to make QRbased payments intuitive, easy to use, and versatile. The app can digitally store all payment instruments, including Visa, Master debit and credit cards, and any bank accounts connected to the JustPay payment ecosystem.

Union Bank Chairman Atul Malik


Union Bank Director/CEO Indrajit Wickramasinghe



Union Bank said yesterday it ended the first three months of 2021 with a strong performance, reflecting a steady growth momentum and fuelling favourable expectations. 
In a statement the bank said its core banking performance was propelled by focused efforts on strategically significant product and service propositions. Despite challenges that continued to prevail during the review period, the bank’s re-strategised product and service prioritisation and swift action to capitalise on the positive sentiments in the macro-economic dynamics since the roll-out of the vaccination campaign, paved the way for this growth in the first quarter of 2021. 
Union Bank’s overall revenue for the quarter was Rs. 1,521 m and despite the tough operating environment the overall revenue grew by 1% over the comparative quarter. 
The bank’s Net Interest Income (NII) was Rs. 985 m and declined marginally by 4% over the comparative period ended 31 March 2020, due to the lower AWPLR that prevailed during the review period in comparison to the previous year. Interest rate rebates and rate caps imposed on certain products under CBSL directives along with concessionary lending programs which continued in support of COVID-19 affected customers further contributed to this decline.
While the credit demand had not picked up at the expected pace despite conducive market interest rates and concessions granted to customers, an uptick in economic activity contributed to the overall credit growth. Effective portfolio management strategies contributed towards managing the NII amidst these challenges.   
Profitability was strengthened by improved net fee and commission income and other operating income. The bank’s net fee and commission income stood at Rs. 216 m at the end of Q1 2021, recording an increase of 7% over the comparative period with fee income from business lending, credit cards and trade related transactions being the primary contributors. 
The Treasury which consists of Interbank, Fixed Income and Corporate Sales desks performed well in the first quarter, making significant contributions to the bank’s bottom line especially in terms of capital and exchange gains. Other Operating Income of the bank increased significantly by 73% and was backed by exchange rate fluctuations. 
As a result of continued efforts for enhanced operational efficiency and cost management initiatives, the Operating Expenses of the bank decreased by 9% YoY to Rs. 907 m during the review period. 
Pre-impairment profits of the bank were Rs. 614 m for the period and indicated a significant growth of 23% YoY. 
In line with prevalent macro-economic stresses and the additional lockdowns the bank conservatively provided impairment charges and accordingly, the impairment charges for the quarter increased by 111% YoY to Rs. 196 m.  Due to focused recovery efforts along with an overall improvement of repayments and loan growth, the Gross Non-Performing Loans (NPL) ratio of the bank improved from 6.05% in December 2020 to 5.85% in the quarter under review.  
Results from operating activities for the quarter was Rs. 418 m and it was increased by 3% YoY.
The bank’s post tax profit including its ownership share of subsidiaries for the quarter was Rs. 282 m and recorded a 57% increase YoY. This represents the positive impact from the Bank and the negative impact that came through the deferred tax asset recorded in UB Finance Co. Ltd.’s books as a result of the change in corporate tax rate. 
The total comprehensive income of the bank was Rs. 137 m.
The bank’s Total Assets increased to Rs. 124,796 m by 31 March 2021. Loans and advances grew by 6% to Rs. 71,609 m while the customer deposits reflected a growth of 2% to Rs. 83,829 m within the review period. 
Efforts of sustaining a healthy CASA inflow was further continued through focused acquisition strategies driven by retail, corporate and SME banking segments. As a result, the overall CASA balances increased by 4.2% during the period under review and the CASA ratio stood at 30.5%
Maintaining strong capital ratios continues to be a management priority. Union Bank’s Total Capital Adequacy Ratio as at 31 March 2021 was 15.88% and is well above the regulatory requirements. 
The Group comprising the bank and its two subsidiaries, National Asset Management Ltd. and UB Finance Company Ltd., reported a Profit after Tax of Rs. 301 m for the period and was increased by 54% YoY. 
Total assets of the Group were Rs. 131,305 m of which 95% was represented by the Bank. The Group maintained a healthy Total Capital Ratio of 15.97% as at quarter-end.  

Operational performance 
Ringing an optimistic start to the year, Union Bank was announced the winner of the  prestigious ‘Best Cash Management Bank in Sri Lanka’ title at the Asian Banker Transaction Finance Awards 2020, reaffirming the success of the bank’s state-of-the-art cash management solution Union Bank BizDirect. 
With increased take up on the digital cash management service by Corporate and SME banking customers of the bank, Union Bank BizDirect contributed to the CASA and fee income growth of the bank in the first quarter of 2021.   
The bank’s Corporate Banking portfolio recorded an upward movement in the quarter under review.  The corporate loans portfolio expanded by 13% Year to Date (YTD) and the deposits base of the corporate banking segment increased by 6% YTD. 
The SME Banking portfolio set off on a positive note in the first quarter of 2021 recording a loan growth of 3% supported by a strategic lending approach. The SME business also created a strong pipeline for asset growth while increasing its geographical focus at branch level for the growth of the SME business including the SME CASA base.
Despite the challenging market dynamics that prevailed, the Retail Banking segment of the bank recorded a YTD deposits growth with a strong CASA portfolio expansion of 10% YTD. Despite the low interest environment, the bank’s prioritised approach to new acquisitions propelled this growth. Retail assets portfolio continued to expand aided by the bank’s focused efforts to grow its credit cards portfolio.
The credit card offers included flexible 0% instalment plans for easy repayments, balance transfer options and special Avurudu discounts at over 100 merchant partner outlets with the aim of acquiring new customers while gaining wallet-share of existing customers. Joining the national drive towards attracting foreign worker remittances, the bank introduced a promotional gift offer for Western Union money transfers during the period under review to further encourage remittances by rewarding customers on a tiered gift plan. 
Union Bank, which completed its milestone 25th year of operations during 2020, celebrated its long-serving employees at a special ceremony held during the 1st quarter of 2021, in a bid to value the lasting commitment of employees who have contributed to the bank’s evolution over the years. 
Union Bank’s Annual Report 2020 was presented in February 2021, on the theme ‘Refocus, Readjust, Reinforce,’ which signifies the bank’s commitment to forge ahead amidst challenges with renewed strength, while building on the profound stakeholder relationships and leveraging on its unique strengths. The bank’s AGM was successfully concluded during the review period and was conducted as a virtual meeting to ensure adherence with the health and safety guidelines set by authorities. 
Commenting on the performance of the Bank, Union Bank Director/Chief Executive Officer Indrajit Wickramasinghe stated: “We are off to a positive start in 2021, and the first quarter performance signifies the bank’s capacity to reach the growth targets set for the year. We are continuing to support our customers who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and will be focused to achieve the desired strategic growth across Retail, SME, and Corporate banking segments.

Even with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, deal activity has remained relatively strong in what could be described as predominantly a buyer’s market. A recent research conducted by PwC, termed ‘Creating value beyond the deal’ found

PwC Director – Mergers and Acquisitions 
			Kavinda Weerakoon



that the deal-making machinery has been far from idle. Despite a lack of physical meetings, deals have still gone ahead and 10-hour video conferences have not been unusual. 
PwC Director – Deals Ruvini Fernando said, “This only means one thing – crisis creates business opportunities, and to this end, the economic downturn impact and the need for companies to restructure their balance sheet will pave way for opportunities. It’s clear that the crisis will reshape the world of deals. We believe that M&A activity will lead the way this time and buyers will now be in the driver’s seat as corporations begin to divest from areas of their business that they can no longer justify and focus on their strongest business lines.” 
She further affirmed that PwC believes some sectors will be changed forever, as will the way businesses are conducted, and many of those changes will be a consequence of the completion of upcoming deals. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations will gain ground and ESG investment strategies that benefit investors, communities, and the planet are seen as creating value that goes beyond financial profit. 
“For example, we envisage a time when polluting assets are bought and transformed into low-carbon businesses in ‘buy dirty, sell clean’ transactions as investors start modelling this new ‘impact turnaround approach. This being the case, they can help companies reach a wider audience of stakeholders who are increasingly considering ESG when they make investments,” Fernando added. 
PwC Director – Mergers and Acquisitions Kavinda Weerakoon emphasised, “As businesses emerge from lockdowns and capital markets (both public and private) reopen and thrive with large corporates and state enterprises raising money, the types of deals that are prevalent and the reasons for these are likely to reshape industries, whilst the pressures of the economic downturn and the need for companies to restructure their balance sheet will create opportunities.” 
According to Weerakoon, deals are likely to ramp up once a baseline has been established. “Businesses that have been hit hard, but have solid fundamentals may become acquisition targets. In certain other industries, decisions will be driven more by strategy. Strong businesses may take the opportunity to adapt their business models to this new normal, perhaps acquiring and picking off underperforming competitors,” he explained.
As such, while recognising that a release of pent-up demand is inevitable, PwC expects to witness a wave of deal activity driven by cash-rich funds and corporations with strong balance sheets aided by the imminent availability of debt. 
The findings also echoes anecdotal evidence that investors are increasingly willing to invest in businesses with a long-term strategic growth plan, allowing the companies to pursue their strategy free from the short-term pressures.
Fernando further stated, “It is predicted that deal activity in the next 12 months, as world economies start to reopen and rebuild, may be the most consequential of the next decade. Companies will face critical choices in the way they respond to the pandemic, which will determine whether they remain viable in the long term. Whether and how to operate in the M&A market may end up being a deciding factor.”

Signing of the MoU at the DRP with senior officials of DRP and LB Finance in attendance 

LB Finance, the country’s leading non-banking financier, recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Department for Registration of Persons (DRP) in order to avail the services of DRP’s online platform for verification of customer National Identification Card (NIC) numbers. 
This is another progressive step the company has taken to expedite and strengthen the customer onboarding process to keep pace with Sri Lanka is fast evolving digital landscape.
The new arrangement will enable the company to validate the NIC particulars furnished by the customers both in physical or digital form against the digital records maintained by the DRP and authenticate their accuracy, thus reducing the risk of identity frauds. 
This initiative is facilitated by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as an interim solution for financial institutions to carry out non-face-to-face customer onboarding without compromising the KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements. 
“DRP, which now functions within the Ministry of Technology, under the purview of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has embarked upon the significant national initiative of issuing Unique Digital Identity to Sri Lankan citizens. The department hopes to start re-enrolling citizens to the new digital ID system by mid of next year,” stated DRP Commissioner General Viyani Gunathilaka. 
Allowing identified key financial sector institutions to access DRP’s online platform for NIC verification will act as an interim solution until the digital ID is available to all citizens.
“The development is set to revamp the conventional customer onboarding process involving multiple forms of verification, and allow LB Finance to realise considerable efficiencies at the point of onboarding customers for its innovative digital financial services,” stated LB Finance Deputy General Manager – Strategy and Digital Finance Bimal Perera.

HONG KONG (AFP): HSBC said on Tuesday that first-quarter profits more than doubled, helped by a reversal in credit losses as well as its major restructuring and pivot to Asia.
Adjusted profit-before-tax rose 109% to $ 6.4 billion, although reported revenue slipped 5% on year to $ 13 billion thanks in part to low interest rates.
The results, which beat estimates, are a shot in the arm for the Asia-reliant lender after a tumultuous year that saw its fortunes take a hammering from the coronavirus and simmering geopolitical tensions.
“I am pleased with our revenue and cost performance, but particularly with our significantly lower expected credit losses,” Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn said in a statement.
Quinn struck a cautiously optimistic note for the near future with hopes high that mass vaccinations may start to ease pressure on the global economy, even as infections continue to soar.
“The economic outlook has improved, although uncertainties remain,” he said.
Bright spots included a $ 400 million reversal in credit losses and all regions reporting profits, including the UK, where pre-tax profits were more than $ 1 billion for the quarter.
Like all banking giants, HSBC was battered by the coronavirus last year with a 30% plunge in 2020 profit.
Under Quinn, HSBC has embarked on a dramatic restructuring.
It has rolled out plans to cut its workforce by about 35,000 to drive down costs and to refocus on its most profitable areas – Asia and the Middle East.
HSBC makes 90% of its profit in Asia, with China and Hong Kong the major drivers of growth.

First Capital Holdings Chief Operating Officer Tharusha Ekanayake




Softlogic Finance PLC has successfully raised Rs. 1 billion through the issuance of a Lease Receivables Securitisation, marking one of the major securitisations in the industry to date in Sri Lanka, the company announced recently. 
In a concentrated effort to move towards a prominent position in the market, the funds raised will be employed to aggressively rollout the new business strategy of the company that has been in operation since May last year.
Softlogic Finance Chief Executive Officer Priyantha Wijesekera commented on the initiative: “The success achieved through the securitization reaffirms investors’ confidence towards the growth trajectory mapped out by the company last year, along with an extensive restructuring across the organisation. The company marked a remarkable growth of its asset quality which is reflected in zero Non-Performing Loan (NPL) levels being achieved in the leasing portfolio acquired during the year.”
First Capital, a leading investment institution in the country, acted as the structuring and placement agent to the issue with Hatton National Bank acting as the Trustee. The funds have been raised through a consortium of investors who were optimistic about the company’s ambitious journey in the non-banking financial institutions (NBFI) category.
Director/CEO Dilshan Wirasekara of First Capital Holdings PLC, the lead manager for the issue, said, “The rise in private sector demand for credit, supported by all-time low interest rates, created an opportune moment to broad-base the liability base of Softlogic Finance. As the lead manager for the issue, we find the success of this Lease Receivables Securitisation as a positive indication of market conditions.”
Softlogic Finance PLC is mainly held by Softlogic Capital PLC which is the financial services holding company of the Softlogic Group that has established an impressive presence in the market with a portfolio comprising Softlogic Life Insurance PLC, Softlogic Finance PLC, Softlogic Stockbrokers Ltd. and Softlogic Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd.

LONDON (Reuters): The dollar hovered above multi-week lows versus major peers on Tuesday, weighed by subdued Treasury yields ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy decision this week, while the yen hardly budged after the Bank of Japan kept its policy on hold.
The safe-haven greenback was largely out of favour after world stocks started the week hitting a record high, although a slight pullback in world stock markets on Tuesday helped keep it above the recent lows.
Trading in currencies was largely subdued, ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve two-day meeting ending on Wednesday, where no change to policy is expected. However, the market will pay close attention to comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who is likely to face questions over whether improving conditions warrant a withdrawal of monetary easing. Most analysts, though, expect him to say such talk is premature, which could put downward pressure on Treasury yields and the dollar.
“By keeping nominal and real US Treasury yields subdued the Fed is taking away the edge that the dollar would otherwise have thanks to the superior performance of the US economy,” said Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX research at Credit Agricole.
“This is also allowing investors to focus on dollar-negatives like President Biden’s tax proposals and the US external imbalances and thus levelling the playing field between the dollar and other currencies.” The dollar index, which tracks the US currency against six peers, was flat at 90.889 in the London morning session, after dipping to the lowest since 3 March overnight at 90.679.
The dollar added 0.2% to 108.34 yen, another haven currency, continuing its rise from the seven-week low of 107.48 reached Friday.

First company to be listed on Empower Board of the CSE
Views listing as an opportunity to boost the image of company, win confidence of future clients
Asserts fast growth requires capital in hand to avail of opportunities
Finds satisfaction in contributing towards stock market development enabling society to reap results
Wants to take company on path of good governance, laying foundation for future growth
Hopeful tax rate of 14% for 3-year period will be offered to SMES as done for larger categories
Aims to tread carefully, ensuring long-term sustainability and steady returns for shareholders
Calls on SMEs to be fearless and take the challenge by listing on the CSE


The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has approved an application submitted by Chrissworld Ltd. for the listing of its ordinary voting shares by way of an offer for subscription and the Initial Public Offering (IPO) is due to open today (27 April). This is a distinct IPO as it is the first company to be listed on the Empower Board of the CSE. Following are excerpts of an interview with Chrissworld Ltd.  Chairman Christo Perera:






Chrissworld Chairman Christo Perera

 




Q: Could you tell us about Chrissworld and its role and journey since initiation? 
 Becoming a Public Listed Company was never a consideration when Chrissworld was incorporated in 2013, but we were absolutely confident that focusing our energies to develop the company’s core business of warehousing was going to put us right there with the big boys. Our growth has been primarily centred on our confidence and belief in ourselves, that we can deliver positive results, whatever the challenges. We started off with a 30,000 sq ft warehouse with zero cargo volumes and not a single client commitment. Within a couple of months, we were at maximum capacity and it’s been in growth mode ever since.
Nature almost had us wiped off in 2016 with major flooding in Colombo destroying our entire capacity of 100,000 sq ft resulting in the loss of all our clients, but with our resolve and determination to survive, coupled with a great team effort by our people, we raised ourselves from the depths to develop the company to where it is today, with a strong customer base spread across 500,000 sq ft of warehousing in 13 locations. 

Q:  What were the main reasons behind the decision to list on the CSE? 
Firstly, the opportunity given for SMEs to list was an attraction, whereas previously only large-scale enterprises were considered for listing. Though most SMEs will still shy away from listing, due to various reasons, we thought of taking up the challenge, since it was a super opportunity to create a positive image of the company in the industry. Seeing the tremendous potential in this business, it was important to project ourselves as a stable and professional company to give us an advantage to win the confidence of future clients. 
Secondly, logistics is a capital-intensive business and fast growth requires capital in hand to ensure every opportunity to develop is not missed out. We have had instances where our clients have requested additional warehouses at short notice. It is a request we should not refuse. Divesting a part of the shareholding to the public is an opportunity to raise required capital in the form of equity than borrowing from banks and other financial institutions. 
Thirdly, it gives us satisfaction that we have contributed in at least a small way to increase activity in the stock market and that society could reap results from our success. 
Last but not least, after having understood the control and monitoring mechanisms involved in a listed company, we felt it was necessary for us to take our company on the path of good governance, which would also lay the foundation for us to go for bigger plans in later years. 

Q: Do you believe the tax relaxations provided by the Government were attractive to take the decision to be listed? 
This was not a factor for our decision. However, we appreciate the benefit and accept it with open arms. We are surprised that the newly-listed SMEs are given a 50% tax benefit only in the first year and the current applicable tax rate of 14% is reverted to thereafter, whereas the larger categories are to enjoy a tax rate of 14% for a full three-year period. Therefore, the tax benefit in its current context is not a real attraction which prompted us to list. 
We are hopeful that the capital market regulators and policymakers would correct this situation in the upcoming Budget so that SMEs would also gain the benefit of tax incentives when a listing is obtained in the CSE. 

Q: As the first Empower Board Listing, could you share your experience in the listing process? 
As reiterated before, obtaining a listing on the CSE was never on our agenda until we were approached by Atarah Capital Partners, an approved ‘sponsor’ firm of the Colombo Stock Exchange. They are the Managers to the IPO of the upcoming listing. 
The decision to list was only taken in October 2020, however we commenced engagement with Atarah Capital Partners way back in 2019 and it deserves the credit for offering the right advice on certain restructuring initiatives to strengthen our balance sheet, and also certain measures to improve corporate governance. 
The demands of the listing process were never a hindrance to us since Atarah Capital Partners with its extensive capital market industry and regulatory experience was able to successfully handle the listing application process, obtain regulatory approvals from both SEC and CSE and also prepare a Prospectus and a Research Report for us. 

Q: Who will be the Registers to the Issue? 
 The Registrars to the Issue is Central Depository Systems Ltd., widely known as CDS. It was recommended to us by Atarah Capital Partners and we are confident that CDS would carry out the relevant tasks successfully. 

Q: In line with the listing process, was the company require to make changes to the present organisational structure? 
Yes, there was a slight structural change, but it was limited only to the Board of Directors. We had to bring in two Independent Directors to meet the regulatory requirements as a listed company. We also appointed Suraj Suraweera, who is a part of our pioneering team, as the Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director; he is probably one of the best in the industry. 
Having said that, Chrissworld even as a private company has always been run professionally and with a lot of discipline. Our career beginnings in listed companies have tattooed disciplined management in us and taught us the importance of being fully focused on this. Thus, it is not a major shift in policy or style of management for us. 
However, we will always be cautious in our forward journey. Many private companies have gone bankrupt due to the directors and shareholders amassing individual wealth and extravagant lifestyles, at the expense of the company. Similarly, even listed companies run into disaster due to high-risk initiatives and ill-planned expansion. We wish to tread carefully and ensure long-term sustainability and steady returns for our shareholders. 

Q: What are the company’s plans for growth and expansion in terms of projects and initiations, with the funds that Chrissworld will be attracting from the stock market? 
The prospectus provides in detail on how the IPO funds will be utilised. The main focus would be to upgrade our facilities and services by introducing new racking, new material handling equipment and add a warehouse management system. These measures will bring very positive results in business growth. 
On paper, we are not showing fancy results, since we firmly believe in the principle of ‘under promise and over deliver’. In fact, we are forecasting single digit growth rates over the next couple of years, which is still a good forecast, but we are extremely confident that we will achieve far beyond our targets. 
We will strive to expand our verticals and introduce several new revenue streams in the future, whilst we look at how to make use of technology to support all our plans. Our aim is to take this company to a billion rupee top line as a first step and be acknowledged as a world-class service provider with a distinct style. We are a different company indeed. Our culture, our flexibility, our hands-on involvement and our intense desire to serve our clients well, all this with not much fanfare and publicity, has been our distinct features and has worked well for us thus far. 

Q: What is your message to other Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) anticipating to list on the Sri Lankan stock market? 
Be fearless and take the challenge to make use of this opportunity of listing on the CSE and use the alternative source of raising equity capital for your company via channelling savings of the general public. Debt capital via banks and finance companies should not be the only source of capital for your businesses. 
The thousands of calls and messages we continue to receive from all over the world appreciating our decision is a testimony of how others perceive this move. It is an opportunity to take your brand to a different level and to raise the bar of management. If your current internal controls are disciplined and you have proper financial management in place, this is not a huge challenge whatsoever.

BENGALURU (Reuters): Analysts and traders have slashed their Gold price forecasts, with many believing a return to last year’s record highs is unlikely as economic recovery tarnishes the safe-haven metal’s appeal, a Reuters poll showed yesterday.
Spot Gold has fallen to around $ 1,775 an ounce from an all-time high of $ 2,072.50 last August, when the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies and forced central banks to pump money into markets and cut interest rates.
Returns on Government bonds, an asset class that competes with Gold, plunged last year, but US Treasury yields have rebounded, fuelling talk of sooner-than-expected central bank tightening that would hurt bullion.
The poll of 42 analysts and traders returned a median forecast for Gold of $ 1,784 an ounce for 2021 and $ 1,743 for 2022 – sharp downgrades from projections of $1,925 and $1,908 respectively in a similar poll three months ago. “Most of the drivers (of the rally) are fading,” said Societe Generale analyst Florent Pele. Analysts said, however, that interest in Gold could be rekindled by events such as a weakening of the US dollar, an inflation surge, falling stock markets or a wave of coronavirus infections big enough to derail economic growth.
They also said a revival in Gold demand in Asia from a slump earlier in the pandemic would prevent prices from falling too far.
The poll forecast silver would average $ 25.75 an ounce this year – down from a forecast of $25.86 in the previous survey - and $ 25 for 2022. Most respondents said Silver would outperform Gold this year thanks to robust industrial consumption. Large quantities of Silver are used in industries such as electronics and solar panels.
“Given silver’s use in renewables... longer-term investor interest is likely to remain supportive of prices, particularly as industrial demand firms,” said Standard Chartered analyst Suki Cooper.

SYDNEY (Reuters): Asian stocks climbed to six-week highs on Monday amid signs the world economic recovery was still well on track, though rising COVID-19 cases in the region weighed on sentiment, pushing oil prices lower.
Futures for Eurostoxx 50 were flat as were those for Germany’s DAX while London’s FTSE futures were a shade weaker. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 were barely changed.
The mood was relatively upbeat in Asia where MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reached its highest since 18 March, despite a late sell-off in Chinese shares.
“Markets have priced in the pandemic as a sprint and not a marathon. That premise could come under stress in the weeks to come,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior Asia-Pacific market analyst for OANDA.
Fears surging COVID-19 cases in India will drive down fuel demand in the world’s third-biggest oil importer put pressure on oil prices on Monday after they fell about 1% last week.
China’s blue-chip CSI 300 index fell 0.7% after hitting its highest level since April 6 earlier in the day. Australia’s benchmark share index was off 0.2% with a public holiday in five of the country’s eight states and territories.
South Korea’s KOSPI share index rose 0.7% while New Zealand shares added 0.6% and Japan’s Nikkei reversed early losses to be up 0.4%.
So far, risk assets such as equities have done well, with the MSCI ex-Japan index on track for a third straight year of positive returns. Since April 2020, the index has offered positive returns in all but three months.
Recent data pointing to a solid global economic recovery had bolstered confidence in risk assets.
Early April manufacturing activity indicators out last week pointed to a robust start to the second-quarter with data hitting record highs in the United States and signalling an end to Europe’s double-dip recession. First-quarter US gross domestic product data due later in the week is likely to show activity probably returned to pre-pandemic levels, analysts said.
“We estimate that the economy will close the output gap and rise above potential in the second half of this year,” ANZ economists wrote in a morning note, suggesting more upside for shares.
Europe “cannot match this, but as 2021 progresses into 2022, the growth differential to the U.S. will narrow.” That said, some economists say the market could hit a soft patch in coming months reflecting concerns ranging from rising COVID-19 cases and worries that most of the benefits from massive fiscal stimulus have already been priced in.
“Stated differently, this may be the last quarter where companies can avoid being penalized for not seeing revenue recover quickly and/or not giving guidance,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note.
Strong recent data meant bonds were sold off, though 10-year U.S. Treasury yields were not far from a recent six-week low on expectations the US Federal Reserve will stay accommodative at its meeting this week.
In currencies, Turkey’s lira edged lower adding to a recent slide and nearing an all-time low as a chill settled on relations with the United States and after the new central bank chief signalled that rate hikes would harm the economy.
The US dollar’s index slipped to 90.679 against a basket of major currencies, a level not seen since 3 March. The greenback was a shade weaker on the safe-haven Japanese yen at 107.80. The euro rose 0.1% to $1.2105. The risk sensitive Australian dollar stayed trapped in a narrow band to be last at $0.7766.
In commodities, US crude fell 73 cents to $61.41 per barrel and Brent eased 78 cents to $65.33.
Gold climbed 0.1% to $1,779.19 an ounce.

People’s Merchant Finance PLC continues achieving strategic milestones in its transformational journey. The latest being the oversubscribed rights issue aimed at strengthening its core capital requirements to fully meet CBSL compliance requirements by 31 March.
People’s Merchant Finance PLC (PMF) incorporated in 1983, is a licensed finance company operating within the Sri Lankan leasing industry for the past 36 years. Post the rights issue, 78.55% shares of the Company are held by Sterling Capital Investments Ltd. (SCIPL), its major investor. The balance shares are held by People’s Bank (10.36%), People’s Leasing and Finance PLC (7.65%), and the public (3.44%). 
The Company announced its renewal, revitalisation, and repositioning plan in mid-2019 when SCIPL became its primary investor and its foremost supporter for sustained future prosperity. Efforts were made to consolidate all aspects of business operations to enable the achievement of strategic priorities to emerge as a leading player in the financial industry of Sri Lanka. 
The Company recording Rs. 22.3 million as profit after taxation in the second quarter of the FY2020/21 after an extended 10-year period of losses followed by a second profitable and successful quarter ended 31 December 2020 which recorded Rs. 31 million as profits after taxation showcases the Company’s resilience and true grit. Following the chartered course of its planned transformation journey, PMF proceeded with, and successfully concluded, a rights issue in March 2021 as a measure to meet the minimum core capital requirements of Rs. 2 billion as stipulated by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) under the Finance Business Act Direction No. 02 of 2017 issued on 23 February 2017.
The rights issue which was delayed due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was announced earlier this year and raised Rs. 811.87 million in funds with the issue of 115 million shares for Rs. 7.00 per share at its conclusion. It also successfully improved the Company’s governance and compliance frameworks thereby safeguarding the interests of all the stakeholders. The rights issue, which was mainly pursued to satisfy the CBSL core capital requirements, also improved the Company’s internal funds position. This influx of funds will be utilised to follow through with its ambitious business expansion and product diversification plans while enabling further operational enhancements. 
The Company expects it can further fast pace its new journey as these new funds will support PMF’s efforts to innovate products and services, increase adoption of technology, and continue to improve regulatory compliance factors within the Company’s business reach. The new funds will also create value for PMF’s stakeholders in the long term while enabling the Company to offer new in-demand products to the market and support the Sri Lankan Government’s Economic Development Agenda.
“PMF’s rights issue was oversubscribed,” says Chandula Abeywickrema, the Company’s Chairman. “For us, this was a fundamental insight to how stakeholders perceive our Company and the changes we have made to date,” he continued. According to Abeywickrema, the rights issue oversubscription also points towards the improving financial stability and reliability of PMF as well as the Company’s ability to move steadily forward with its five-year transformational strategic plan. 
The Chairman continues to attribute the Company’s recent success to the strength and stability brought to PMF by SCIPL, the professionalism of the new Board of Directors together with their extensive expertise and experience, and the dedicated efforts of the management team lead by a capable CEO in executing key initiatives and engagements at the right time in the right way. 
The success of the Company’s recent rights issue is expected to build the future confidence of existing and prospective stakeholders. There is also no doubt that PMF’s journey of success will not be gain stayed. Profitability amidst the unprecedented challenges encountered by the Company and its stakeholders due to COVID-19 is a fundamental premise for PMF’s belief. As PMF Chief Executive Officer Nalin Wijekoon reiterated, “We are on a steady and stable path of growth and prosperity. The Company made profits for the first time in a year where many organisations were negatively impacted. It gives me great pleasure to lead a team of dedicated professionals who have given their all even as they faced personal challenges. We [PMF] are on a path of achievements, and the support of all our shareholders and other stakeholders is duly noted and well-appreciated.”
The future of PMF remains unchartered with myriad emerging opportunities and possibilities for evolution within a changing business landscape. The Company will stay its course of change and continue to serve a wide cross-section of the nation’s people by offering them financial products that suit and meet their needs. PMF also aims to increase the financial inclusion of rural communities, women, and youth by supporting and empowering them to achieve financial independence and prosper to become economically viable individuals. The support given and shown by all stakeholders is the motivating factor for the Company to continue this journey despite challenges and obstacles, pursuing a path which fosters national economic growth, sustained business development, value creation for the PMF’s stakeholders.

Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) Chairman Viraj Dayaratne PC in this interview with the Daily FT takes stock of recent developments in the capital market, including key milestones and efforts taken to address issues. He also deals with the bull runs at the Colombo stock market in December 2020 and January 2021 and the subsequent fall and how the SEC is dealing with regulation as well as market development and the new SEC Act. Here are excerpts:

By Nisthar Cassim






SEC Chairman Viraj Dayaratne PC




Q: How do you view the Colombo stock market’s performance, especially since the all-time high level in January 2021?
Volatility by way of ups and downs is normal in any market. It is the very nature of markets though every regulator will want to and will take action to avoid too much volatility. Yes we saw in January the market rose unprecedentedly high and all were aware that that level could not be sustained though investor behaviour was influenced by an uptick in sentiments. 
It is good to have bullish runs but at the same time it is a fact that such a phenomenon isn’t permanent since there will be profit taking naturally. We weren’t overly alarmed because since mid-2020 the Colombo stock market has been on the up in a well measured way on sentiments and future earnings outlook despite challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. In that context the spike in December 2020 and January 2021 wasn’t a surprise and the correction thereafter is linked to normal profit taking as seen in any market. 
One also must take into account that interest rates declined since mid-last year, prompting high net worth individuals to enhance their exposure to equities and retailers to get active. Due to import restrictions, those in the vehicle trade also shifted their funds to the stock market. More importantly we saw a host of new investors entering the market as evidenced by 20,000 new accounts opened, which is partly due to digitalisation initiatives as well. Around 90% of the new accounts opened were via online.
We also stepped up investor education especially through popular social media channels, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc. so the newcomers make their decisions based on recommendations from Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) than relying on various individual social media posts. We have uploaded a list of RIAs on our website.
As a departure from the traditional role of the regulator, we went out of the way and encouraged people to invest in listed equities given their medium- to long-term upside for the benefit of people. We did so with a caution that in any market, all must be mindful of the famous saying ‘buyer beware’. 
By encouraging digital initiatives, we improved ease of entry, trading as well as information dissemination especially via social media platforms. There have been over 50,000 downloads of the new CSE app and this is very encouraging. 

Q: How is the new administration at SEC addressing the core function of regulating the market?
With the revival of the stock market the SEC has been responsible for how it conducts itself. We did proactive smart surveillance which ensured timely and preventive measures to instil discipline and prudence on the part of brokers. During the bull run we were paying attention to our regulatory role and we are continuing to do the same. We are on the ball. Where necessary and whatever enforcement action needed we have taken to stop, warn or punish misconduct, though we haven’t gone public. 
There is a fine line between what is permitted and what is prohibited, and based on this a comprehensive manual has been prepared to educate and guide capital market participants. The approach of early and timely intervention has helped improve regulation and reduced incidents of misconduct. Regulating the market is a fine balance and a tightrope. We should neither ruin the market nor prop it. 

Q: What is on offer next in the digitalisation roll out?
We will roll out the second phase of the digitalisation initiative which enables resident and non-resident Sri Lankans abroad and foreign and local companies to open accounts online subject to meeting the conditions. Consultative meetings have been held in developing a suitable framework with the relevant stakeholders. 
One of the items under the second phase will be the CDS eConnect. Its main functionalities will include viewing of CDS account information, viewing of balances, transaction history, facility to request reports, sending information requests to CDS/stockbroker, ability to give instructions to change CDS account details of the logged in user accounts, intra account transfer requests, access for brokers online trading apps (an integrated solution), corporate action alerts such as dividends/rights and other corporate actions and access to research reports, etc. User categories will be individual CDS accountholders, issuers, CDS participants, institutional users, etc. Some of the other offerings under the second phase are eIPOs, eWallet, chat bot, My CSE, My Portfolio, voice clips to help in accounting, etc. 

Q: What measures has the SEC championed to ensure there is wider public participation in the stock market?
 Partly due to the revival of the market and initiatives by the SEC and CSE, there has been a surge in new investors, especially the young. We are taking stock market and investor education to provinces via our initiative titled ‘Kotas Welendapola Nagarayen Nagarayata’ (stock market city to city) with four workshops in Sinhala planned between May and June in cities of Colombo, Kurunegala, Kandy, Matara and Jaffna (in Tamil). The CSE’s mobile app as well as SEC website will be made trilingual. 
Giving proactive leadership the SEC has also supported endeavours to increase listings on the CSE. Engagement with chief financial officers as well as nearly 70 family companies were made. The misunderstanding that listing is cumbersome and costly was dispelled via these engagements and SEC and CSE also highlighted a host of measures to simplify listing rules as well as operationalise alternatives such as the Empower Board targeting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The first IPO by Chrissworld Ltd. is available for subscription. We are keen to encourage more services sector companies including startups to list since services account for over 50% of the country’s GDP.
I must emphasise that the WindForce IPO was processed and approved within three weeks so as to encourage those who are keen to rely on the capital market. The Rs. 3.2 billion IPO which was the biggest in 11 years turned out to be a major success with eight times oversubscription.
The new Government has announced tax incentives to those who list before 31 December 2021. Listing is also beneficial as it ensures collateral free capital as well as improved corporate governance, professionalism and sustainability of enterprises. We are proactively supporting more listings as the conditions are right apart from the incentives offered. The SEC is also encouraging Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACS) with the framework has been approved. A sponsor (reputed individual or company) lists a shell company with an IPO. Funds raised (from accredited investors initially) will be utilised to acquire willing unlisted companies. CSE has been tasked to come with the rule/guidelines.
We are also promoting ‘over the counter’ trading of paper gold products and the framework has already been approved in principle.
Another focus is the revival of debt listing and in April we saw the Ceylon Electricity Board becoming the second State-Owned Entity to issue listed debentures worth Rs. 20 billion, a record at CSE. This issue too was a success and we will facilitate more listed debt issues by SOEs.  We also launched the Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) option and are confident of activity in the near term after a few issues are resolved since there is strong interest.
From the perspective of further capital market awareness, it will be introduced as a subject in the school curricula from Grade 6 onwards as opposed to Grade 10 at present. We are working with the Ministry of Education and the National Institute of Education (NIE) on that. The proposed curricular has already been submitted to the NIE. We are planning to include this in the 2023 syllabus change. 

Q: What is the status of the new SEC Act?
 After the Attorney General clears it, the Cabinet will have to approve it once again and then the Bill can be presented in Parliament. We are hopeful that it will happen soon. The new Act will ensure best practices in regulation ensuring consistency, predictability and effectiveness. It gives more teeth or overarching powers to the SEC to deal with breaches of the law and the rules.
Under the new Act there is provision for issuing ‘Freezing Orders’ for a limited period of seven days similar to that in the Finance Business Act. The SEC has to go to Court if it wants to extend such Orders and the accused party will be heard before the Court decides whether such order should be extended. There is also provision for the imposition of Administrative Sanctions which can only be imposed after a fair hearing. 
These provisions enable the SEC to impose sanctions which are commensurate with the breach committed. Although additional powers have been conferred on the SEC in order to ensure deterrence, there are checks and balances to ensure that there will be no arbitrariness in their application. We are keen to ensure that there is predictability and consistency in the way we act in order to ensure fair play in the process of regulation.
In addition there are several other salutary features which will help develop the market and bring more clarity to its functions. A lot of stakeholder input has gone into the new Act and Parliament is able to make further changes if necessary after the Bill is taken up in Parliament and prior to its approval. 

Q: DVP and Demutualisation too have taken very long. What is the progress?
Delivery versus Payment (DVP) is on course for implementation in the second quarter with test runs already concluded. Efforts on demutualisation of the CSE are also progressing whilst there is a likelihood of a strategic investor like many other global exchanges coming on board. 
Good corporate governance rules proposed have been after due consultation and inputs from multiple stakeholders and not entirely an act of the SEC. The draft is open for public scrutiny and suggestions for further considerations to ensure best practices are welcome.

Q: What is your assessment of the future of the capital market?
The capital market, consisting of listed equities, debt and other instruments, has an important role to play in a country’s development. There is immense potential for the same in Sri Lanka provided we develop it carefully and consistently with stakeholder engagement and inputs. We also need to attract more foreign institutional investors and efforts will be made once external conditions are favourable to conduct roadshows, etc. 
The SEC with the Foreign Ministry and the CSE is currently conducting online forums for the staff of Sri Lankan Embassies abroad in order to educate them on the attractive market valuations, the growth potential of the market and latest developments. The next step will be to organise forums for foreign investors, fund managers and Sri Lankan diaspora.
As opposed to what and how some may negatively portray the prospects, one of the world’s biggest fund managers Blackstone buying the Piramal Glass stake and Norwegian fund Norfund agreeing to take a 10% stake in NDB are among positive signs for investors to take strength from and be optimistic.
With an improved outlook for the economy and judging by record quarterly corporate earnings despite the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a host of measures already taken and those planned both by the SEC and the CSE and the Government, the capital market is bound to grow further with resilience.
On our part we have strengthened the investor protection aspects as well as best practices on the part of brokers, who must be commended for readily agreeing. My advice to investors, both old and new, is don’t be wary of the market but be informed and professionally advised and make your decisions accordingly.

MUMBAI, (Reuters): The Reserve Bank of India said on Monday that chief executive officers and managing directors at Indian private-sector banks will be eligible to hold these posts for up to 15 years, as it unveiled a series of rules on term limits.
Analysts welcomed the new rules and said they may be extended to the shadow banking sector as well.
“These are some learnings from the banking crisis that unfolded last year from the Yes Bank case, so the RBI is putting these steps in place to ensure that such kind of issues do not arise in future,” said Asutosh K. Mishra, analyst at a domestic brokerage house, Ashika Stock Broking.
In March 2020, the central bank rescued Yes Bank, then the country’s fifth-largest private lender, as it reeled under a mountain of bad loans due to its exposure to shadow lenders and real estate companies.
The central bank also said on Monday that a CEO, MD or whole-time director (WTD) who is a promoter or major shareholder of a bank as well will not be eligible to hold these posts for more than 12 years, with an extension of up to 15 years permitted at its sole discretion.
Bank chiefs who are not promoters will be eligible for a second term, even after the 15-year period.
“Thereafter, the individual will be eligible for re-appointment as MD and CEO or WTD in the same bank, if considered necessary and desirable by the board, after a minimum gap of three years,” it added.
During this three-year gap, the individual shall not be appointed or associated with the bank or its group entities in any capacity, directly or indirectly, it added.
RBI also said the chairman of the board must be an independent director.
It also listed some other guidelines on the pay of non-executive directors, age limits and setting up of audits, remuneration and risk-management committees. The RBI has given banks until 1 October to comply with the rules.
However, the chairpersons, MDs, CEOs who have already completed 12 or 15 years will be allowed to complete their current term as already approved by the RBI, it said.
Mishra said lenders like Kotak Mahindra Bank may be affected though the impact will not be felt immediately as RBI has allowed CEOs to complete their current tenure.
Promoter Uday Kotak, who has been at the helm of the bank for over 12 years, had been re-appointed for a term of three years starting January 2021.
“The central bank may extend these rules even to the shadow banking sector, which will be a step in the right direction,” said India Ratings and Research Head of Financial Institutions Prakash Agarwal.

One of many solar panel installations at Commercial Bank branches
 

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has become the first Sri Lankan bank to achieve carbon neutrality for the entirety of its operations, encompassing all 268 branches and its head office – a monumental milestone in the bank’s commitment to the environment.
Becoming a net-zero carbon company was one of Commercial Bank’s Green Goals, to be achieved by the close of its centenary year in 2020. 
The bank’s carbon neutral status has been affirmed by Climate Smart Initiatives Ltd., which executed the quantification of the Bank’s carbon footprint in accordance with the ISO 14064‐1‐2018 standard. A total of 13 emission sources covering both direct and indirect emission sources of the bank were considered for this analysis. Additionally, the Sri Lanka Climate Fund operating under the Ministry of Environment performed an independent third-party verification in accordance with the ISO 14064-3-2018 guidelines and awarded the prestigious ISO 14064 certificate to the bank.
Commenting on this achievement, Commercial Bank Managing Director S. Renganathan said: “This is what success looks like to us; working towards the enhancement of shareholder returns without compromising the bank’s responsibility to society and the environment. We are delighted to have achieved ‘carbon-neutral’ status – no small feat for the largest private bank in the country. The bank believes that sustainable success is a balancing act – between continuity and change, stability and disruption, being conservative and bold. Our sustainable banking practices have been designed with this in mind.”
The bank began the process of measuring its carbon footprint in 2017 as its first step to reducing its environmentally harmful emissions. Mitigation actions such as the instalment of solar PV systems, efficient AC systems, LED lighting and such were introduced even before the carbon footprint measuring process began. Currently, 49 branches of the bank are powered partially or entirely by solar energy.
Subsequent to the environment-friendly adjustments, the bank managed to reduce emissions attributed to the consumption of grid-connected electricity from 8,172 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in 2017 to 7,649 tCO2e in 2019. This 5.88% decrease in grid-connected electricity consumption led to the reduction of total Green House Gas (GHG) emissions of the Bank from 13,055 tCO2e to 12,121 tCO2e, which is more than a 7% decline over the two years.
The bank’s multifaceted green initiatives that contributed to its carbon neutrality status and achieving its Green Goals include lending to support eco-friendly operations, migrating customers to paperless banking, reducing consumption of non-renewable energy, water, and other resources in its own operations, and support to community initiatives that help conserve habitats and the environment.
Commercial Bank financed the first commercially viable wind power project and the first commercial-scale solar power project developed in Sri Lanka. It also continues to support projects that focus on renewable energy, energy and water efficiency, waste management, emission reductions, drip irrigation, and rainwater harvesting.

The KPMG Sri Lanka Academy presents the 17th virtual session of the ‘Friday Mid-Afternoon Chat’ series. This week’s webinar will be on ‘101s of Discounted Cash Flow Valuations’ conducted by KPMG in Sri Lanka Principal, Advisory Ajantha Weerasekara.
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method is one of the most commonly applied absolute valuation techniques, which has a solid theoretical support in terms of time value of money, opportunity cost of capital, capital structure and value of firms, etc. DCF method is also quite popular as it can be customised well to match different business models, industries and scenarios, while other valuation techniques may not offer that much flexibility. 
However, these benefits come with inherent risks associated with the methodology, where the practitioners will have to come up with a number of assumptions and inputs, on which DCF method relies heavily. The output in terms of the valuation given by the DCF method will be as good as the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs employed by the users. 
Given these complexities, it is important to understand the basics of the DCF method in order to understand when and how to apply the technique for whatever the purpose that we have, which will be covered on this Friday Mid Afternoon Chat. This will be the first of a series of webinars on DCF methodology, which we are planning to bring to you through our Friday Midafternoon Chat series. 
The session is scheduled for 23 April (Friday) from 3 p.m. onwards.

LONDON (Reuters): Insurers want to put more money into private equity this year while scaling back on hedge funds, a survey by Goldman Sachs Asset Management showed on Wednesday.
Private equity was the most-favoured asset class for insurers seeking to increase investment returns, followed by middle market corporate loans and infrastructure debt, the survey said.
Private equity returns in the past 10 years “have been strong and have outperformed other asset classes,” Michael Siegel, global head of insurance asset management at GSA, told a media briefing, which he said helped explain consistent insurer interest in the asset class in recent years.
Thirty-eight percent of respondents plan to increase their allocation to private equity and 23% to maintain existing positions, with only 1% planning to reduce. The remainder of respondents don’t invest in private equity.
But only 5% plan to up allocations to hedge funds, and 6% aim to cut.
Hedge fund returns have been “modest” in the last decade, Siegel said, adding they were expensive for insurers to hold in terms of capital requirements in some jurisdictions.
Risk appetite overall was stronger than average, according to the survey, which is in its 10th year. Insurers have become optimistic that the United States will avoid a recession in the next three years, with 62% of respondents taking that view.
Concern over environmental, social and governance issues has grown, with 83% of global insurers taking such risks into consideration in the 2021 survey, compared with 32% in 2017.
But the global pandemic remained the top geopolitical risk for insurers over the next 12 months, ahead of the US-China trade conflict and US politics.
The global survey of insurance chief investment and financial officers had 286 respondents representing $ 13 trillion in assets under management.

Initiative to meet rising demand for convenient and secure transactions

 
Mastercard is strengthening its global Digital First program across Asia Pacific with a range of innovative partners to deliver even more seamless and secure digital payment options than consumers expect as they shop and bank online more than ever before.
Mastercard’s Digital First program maximises the safety, security and convenience of e-commerce, online banking and contactless transactions by providing the guidelines for payment processors, fintechs, issuing banks and other partners to create end-to-end digital payment options at scale. 
Backed by the speed and security of Mastercard’s global network – including the Mastercard Processing platform to enable instant issuance – the Digital First program offers consumers the ease of applying online, rapid access to begin making purchases, flexibility and peace-of-mind while shopping. It gives consumers the choice of making payments with digital cards or directly from bank accounts by using smartphones, smartwatches or any other digital device. It also provides innovative new ways to receive payments including Mastercard’s QR on Card, which places a QR code on a consumer’s payment card to allow senders to scan and transfer funds securely and easily to their account of choice. 
With consumers making a rapid and lasting shift to a ‘digital by default’ mindset, Mastercard research shows that 30% of people in Australia, 49% in India, 55% in China and 34% in Japan plan to make more purchases online. A large majority – 71% in Australia, 77% in India, 73% in China and 62% in Japan – believe the shift to contactless payments is here to stay.
With this greater demand for digital experiences, Mastercard is enabling its customers to innovate faster by providing a network of partners that support each step of the consumer digital journey – from acquisition and usage to management. 
“Mastercard has been leading the drive into inclusive digital commerce for many years by delivering frictionless and secure payment experiences for the billions of people shopping and managing their finances at their fingertips around the clock and around the world,” said Mastercard Executive Vice President, Products and Innovation, Asia Pacific Sandeep Malhotra. 
“Combined with the strengths of Mastercard’s partners, the Digital First program offers the convenience of fast, transparent payments and maximises consumer choice with everything from digital cards in e-wallets, to QR on Card, to the Pay by Account solution that lets people make payments from a bank account using their financial service provider’s app. For merchants, the benefits include access to a wider consumer base and faster availability of funds.” 
In Asia Pacific, Mastercard’s Digital First products are becoming the standard in many markets with customers including HSBC, Mox by Standard Chartered and WeLab Bank in Hong Kong SAR, Singapore’s GrabPay, Atlantis in Singapore and India, RBL Bank, Yes Bank and BOB Financial Solutions Ltd., also in India, VIB in Vietnam, Sumitomo Mitsui Card Co. Ltd and Credit Saison in Japan, as well as a number of financial institutions in Australia such as Bankwest and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank.  
Just today, Mastercard and BOB Financial Solutions Ltd. (BFSL) announced that they will jointly offer Mastercard’s QR on Card service for small and micro-merchants in India, enabling these businesses to accept cashless payments. This service, the first-of-its kind in the world, empowers merchants to spend and earn on the same card, making it easier for them to receive digital payments flexibly and quickly while making deliveries or serving customers in-store.
The strengthening of Mastercard’s Digital First program in the region mirrors its expansion in North America to deliver unique value for cardholders and account holders with the best-in-class banking and payments experience in today’s rapidly evolving digital economy. 
For the Digital First program in Asia Pacific, Mastercard offers the benefits of its own Mastercard Processing platform and partners with payment processors and fintechs including Euronet Worldwide, Tutuka, HPS, Global Processing Services (GPS) and Episode Six, along with digital platform providers such as Thales, Verestro (uPaid), Nuclei and Infosys.
Together with these partners, Mastercard’s Digital First program focuses on: 
1.Online application: Enables people to apply online and receive card information almost immediately upon issuer approval.
2.Near-instant issuance: Gives cardholders access to their card information almost immediately so that they may begin making purchases online, within apps and in stores through digital wallet offerings. An optional physical card is also available.
3.Quick access to details: Credentials can be accessed swiftly and securely via the digital environment, eliminating the need for names and numbers to be displayed on the physical card.
4.Simple and easy management: Allows people to manage their payment credentials digitally, including access to transaction history and balance information, alerts and card benefits.
5.Choice of payment and receiving instrument: Offers consumers the option of both paying and receiving funds with a bank account or a card, enabling them to transact anywhere and anytime, while leveraging Mastercard’s global acceptance.
6.Safety and security: The Digital First program provides the highest standards of security to ensure consumers continue to be protected for all online and offline transactions.

Standard Chartered Sri Lanka’s National Long-Term Rating has once again been affirmed at ‘AAA(lka)’ by Fitch Ratings Lanka with a Stable Outlook. According to a statement by Fitch Ratings, the Bank’s support-driven credit profile is among the strongest in the country’s rated entities, and as a result, the rating is at the highest end of the National Rating scale for Sri Lanka. Standard Chartered Sri Lanka’s rating is underpinned by Fitch’s expectation of a high probability of support from the head office of Standard Chartered Bank in the UK.
The Bank’s financial profile is expected to remain better than local peers in the medium term, reflecting the Bank’s healthy underwriting standards and risk controls. Fitch Ratings Lanka also notes that Standard Chartered Sri Lanka’s non-performing loans ratio increased to 2.7% by end-3Q20 – better than the sector average, driven mostly by retail loans, and that its common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 16.8% at end-3Q20 was higher than the sector’s 13%. Fitch believes that the Bank’s funding and liquidity profile will remain steady in the medium term, underpinned by a healthy share of customer deposits and the availability of inter-group funding.
“Standard Chartered Sri Lanka welcomes the AAA(lka) rating by Fitch Ratings Lanka with a Stable Outlook, reaffirming the Bank’s standing in the country. We have been able to leverage on our international network to provide vital facilities for the local market reeling from dual disasters in the form of the Easter Sunday attack followed by the global pandemic. The Bank will continue to provide stable financing for our clients in Sri Lanka and support their growth and recovery in the post pandemic world,” commented Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Bingumal Thewarathanthri.
Standard Chartered Sri Lanka facilitated the financing for several local organisations to enhance their manufacturing capacity of essential personal protective equipment (PPE) for the global fight against COVID-19 as part of the Bank’s global $ 1 billion not-for-profit financing commitment for pandemic recovery. To date, the Bank has provided more than $ 45 million in lending and working capital to companies in Sri Lanka under this program.
In Sri Lanka, the Bank manages over 40% of the correspondent banking volume of the country, with a strong MNC base and is also a significant player in the country’s infrastructure projects and export-related businesses. Standard Chartered Sri Lanka has also supported many local clients go global using its unique global footprint in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
Standard Chartered Bank recently published its first annual Sustainable Finance Impact Report highlighting the Bank’s unique contribution to tackling climate change, and financing dedicated to achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 91% of Standard Chartered’s total sustainable finance assets are located in emerging markets, and 86% of it is in some of the world’s least developed nations. To this effect, the Sri Lanka branch is well-positioned to work with its clients to tap the opportunities in this space.

HNB SOLO team with a merchant at the launch of the “Rata Purama LANKAQR’ campaign in Kandy 
 

HNB PLC once again joined the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to promote the ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ campaign to raise awareness and encourage the public in the Kandy District towards a cashless payment ecosystem. 
HNB, together with other financial institutions and telecommunication partners, participated in the day-long event held at the Kandy City Centre. The bank raised awareness regarding its LANKAQR integrated HNB SOLO payment app while onboarding merchants during the promotional campaign. 
“During the early stages of the pandemic we witnessed many of our customers and members of the public seamlessly adopt our cashless and contactless payment app HNB SOLO. With COVID and the subsequent launch of the ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ campaign the number of users of these types of systems have increased exponentially. 
“Given that the mutual vision of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and HNB is for a financially and technologically empowered Sri Lanka, HNB is proud to serve as an enthusiastic partner to roll out LANKAQR island-wide. The fact that we now have merchants in the cultural capital of Sri Lanka making this shift is another major milestone in this digitalisation journey,” HNB Deputy General Manager – Retail and SME Banking Sanjay Wijemanne said. 
During the campaign, HNB also raised awareness regarding SOLO’s many facilities, including zero physical contact and increased efficiency on all transactions. Since its launch in 2019, SOLO has witnessed a consistently growing customer base. HNB continuously works to improve the app’s features and functionality by refining its user interface, enabling customers to experience intuitive, easy-to-use and versatile QR-based payments.
Officially launched in Matale last year, the ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ campaign has held promotional events in Colombo and Galle. The QR- based system allows banks, financial institutions and telecommunication service providers to facilitate fast, secure and affordable digital payments to any merchant or service provider through their digital payment app or platform.

There will be five overall winners whose prize money will be over Rs. 1 million and each category winner will get Rs. 100,000. Ten randomly picked voters too will receive handsome cash awards,” said Ceylinco General Insurance Chairman/CEO Patrick Alwis.  
The guidelines and the criteria of the competition were announced recently through a dedicated website and other social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube as well as LinkedIn. Contestants can perform under five categories, namely, singing, dancing, instrumental performances, fashion modelling and funny videos/standup comedy. 
Individuals over 18 years could perform under the individual category whilst the group category will have no age limit. Under the group category either families or a group of friends could take part. Each entry will have to be specially recorded for this competition. Prior to recording the performance, they should download the image of the logo and have it displayed prominently in the background. Performances could be recorded using a smart phone or a video cam.  
Also, a special website has been hosted for this purpose where interested contestants can view all details relating to the guidelines, criteria and regulations of the competition in all three languages. This website, www.ceylincovipcybertharu.com, will be the official site on which the contestants should upload video clips of their performances. Contestants will be given a 20-day period starting from 20 April to 10 May to record and upload their performances to the website.  
Once the video clips are received, they will be sent to an eminent panel of judges comprising industry professionals such as Bhathiya & Santhush, Pooja Umashankar and Ramod Malaka who will scrutinise them carefully and select the best 20% from each category. 
The uniqueness of the competition is that the selected performances will be sent back to the participants for them to post them on their individual social media platforms. Thereafter, they can encourage their friends and followers to vote for them through the website. 
Contestants who receive the highest number of votes will be selected as winners. Each category will have a winner whilst an overall winner too will be selected together with four runner-ups.

Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Citibank N.A. – Colombo Branch's (CitiSL) National Long-Term Rating at 'AAA(lka)'. The Outlook is Stable. 
CitiSL's rating reflects Fitch's expectation of continued timely support for CitiSL from the US-based head office, if required, subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting funds into Sri Lanka. 
The Fitch assessment captures CitiSL's status as a branch of Citibank, N.A. (A+/Negative/a), which means it is part of the same legal entity. The high probability of support also stems from the alignment of CitiSL's objectives and strong operational integration with Citigroup. The small size of the branch, at less than 1% of Citibank, N.A.'s total assets, implies that support would not be material to the head office. 
Citibank, N.A.'s rating and CitiSL's relative credit worthiness are higher compared to the vast majority of Sri Lanka's rated universe of issuers, including the sovereign (CCC); as a result, CitiSL's rating is at the highest end of the National Rating scale for Sri Lanka. 
CitiSL's record of a zero non-performing level for asset quality has remained intact since 2009 despite the challenging operating environment. This reflects CitiSL's stringent underwriting standards that focus mainly on selective lending to top-tier local and multinational corporates and financial institutions. Profitability remained under pressure, albeit better than local peers, with narrower interest margins amid the low interest environment. 
The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 24.5% - higher than local peers – at endSeptember 2020 and the ability to access funding from Citigroup, if required, makes CitiSL's financial profile better than that of local peers. Moreover, any weaker financial performance at CitiSL will not have any bearing on support prospects from head office. 
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade: 
There is no rating upside for the National Long-Term Rating, as it is already at the highest point on the scale. 
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade: 
CitiSL's rating is most likely to be downgraded on significant changes to Fitch's expectation of support from Citibank, N.A., such as a change in the branch's legal status or the branch being divested. Downward rating pressure could also result should Citibank, N.A.'s Long-Term IDR fall below 'BB-', although Fitch sees that as highly unlikely in the near to medium term. 
Significant change in National Rating relativities in Sri Lanka's rating universe could also lead to a downgrade of CitiSL's National Rating.

Pomelo Pay CEO and Co-Founder Vincent Choi said: “Due to its incredibly prosperous hospitality and tourism sectors, the Maldives has been hit particularly hard by COVID-19 which has limited occasions for travel and social interaction. Through our partnership with the Bank of Maldives, we are hoping to breathe fresh life into these crucial industries.
“By expanding our product offering, the 99% of the country’s merchant base which our services cover will be able to access a suite of new features which help make the process of taking payments easier. From globally recognised brands such as Radisson Blu and Conrad Hotels and Resorts through to smaller, independent owned business, we help keep our partners ahead of the competition by constantly innovating.”
Bank of Maldives CEO and Managing Director Tim Sawyer said: “In the burgeoning e-commerce industry, our customers’ payment experience needs to be simple, secure and cost-efficient. Our partnership with Pomelo Pay has enabled to us to offer businesses with solutions for seamless payment integration to fuel their growth, and comes at a critical time as the Maldives is well on its way to recovery post-COVID.”
In November, Pomelo Pay secured a £2.1million investment in a seed funding round led by Force Over Mass. The investment will be used to expand Pomelo Pay’s rapidly growing team and build on its international reach – which includes offices in London and Singapore – with an expanded presence in countries across Europe and Asia. The business was also recently selected to join Tech Nation’s Fintech 3.0, a growth program for the best and brightest UK fintechs.

Access to capital and the existence of a financial safety net are vital components for any socio-economic group that finds itself wedged in the perilous no-man’s land between the boundaries of poverty and a lower-middle class lifestyle – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara
 

Access to financial products is a fundamental necessity for any society that seeks to foster and develop a thriving middle class. Such access complements the fulfilment of basic socio-economic needs, such as access to health care, education and the guarantee of property rights. 
Considering current socio-economic trends in Sri Lanka, a thriving middle class can emerge only through the development of an entrepreneurial class – one that is independent, dynamic and untethered to any dependence on the State for its welfare.
Access to capital and the existence of a financial safety net are vital components for any socio-economic group that finds itself wedged in the perilous no-man’s land between the boundaries of poverty and a lower-middle class lifestyle. It is not easy for this group to rise above its current economic predicament through sheer entrepreneurial effort. In this respect, access to micro-insurance can be a deciding factor in alleviating poverty and providing a financial safety net for this aspirational middle class. 
Micro-insurance refers to any financial product that provides some risk-mitigating function on the same basis as conventional insurance products. It can be distinguished from conventional insurance by the category and the (comparatively) low-value of what is insured, and the relatively small sums paid as premium. 
Owing to the fact that it is relatively cheaper, and potentially easier to access, a sound micro-insurance industry can provide middle-class entrepreneurs a viable avenue to managing their risks. Therefore, micro-insurance can provide an impetus for entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka.
While conventional insurance in Sri Lanka is regulated under the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act, no comparative legislation has been enacted to regulate micro-insurance. As such, products that may fall under the definition of micro-insurance are currently only offered by conventional insurance companies and regulated under this Act. 
The sale of micro-insurance products by traditional insurance companies is often constrained by supply side dynamics, such as low financial incentives for offering products that only generate low premiums, and a traditional distribution mechanism that allows little leeway for the mass distribution of such products. 
In a regulatory landscape that imposes stringent, and often necessary, capital requirements and compliance requirements on registered insurers, the profit incentive to develop such products is often constrained, and can only be mitigated by up-scaling the product distribution methodology. However, current laws also regulate the distribution process, as insurance brokers are also required to maintain adequate capital reserves, and to follow regulatory compliance requirements, including compliance with maximum commission rates payable on sales. 
In order to succeed, it is imperative that the sale of micro-insurance is undertaken by the private sector, as it is unrealistic to expect the State to take a lead in such a process. Private insurers must then be permitted to offer such products in ways that minimises the costs involved in developing such products and in bringing such products to market. 
Countries that have managed to develop a regulatory framework for micro-insurance have seen the private sector take the lead in marketing and distributing such products – often in dynamic and unconventional ways. 
In countries such as Thailand, for instance, micro-insurance products are often available in most convenience stores, such as a local seven-eleven. The wide availability of such products, using distribution channels outside the conventional distribution mechanisms available in Sri Lanka, has resulted in a wider penetration of insurance within society. 
A counter argument to the wide-scale promotion of insurance products is that it offers consumers little insight into the terms and conditions of the products on offer. In such a context, the risk of mis-selling such products can emerge. This is a valid concern, and also something that insurance regulators, including the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL), have grappled with.
The IRCSL, tasked by statute with both developing the insurance sector in Sri Lanka, and ensuring the safety of all policyholders, has had to tread carefully in this regard. It has aimed to ensure that any proposal to increase the penetration levels of insurance in Sri Lanka, through the development of micro-insurance regulations, does not have a harmful effect on the financial security of the policyholders who may purchase such products.
Concerns with regard to micro-insurance, though valid, should not act as a barrier to the exploration of various regulatory mechanisms that would cover micro-insurance. No regulatory mechanism, in any industry, is fool-proof, and the threat of misuse will never cease to exist. Therefore, a visionary and open-minded approach to the development of this sector is needed. 
Some leeway must be given for private entities that may not be currently regulated to develop micro-insurance products, and for the authorisation of a distribution mechanism that is not constrained by current regulations. Ultimately, such an approach can lead to the development of a sound micro-insurance industry, which will no doubt help the advancement of an entrepreneurial class in 
Sri Lanka.

Lists 11 countries including Singapore, India, Malaysia, Japan and China as warranting placement on its “Monitoring List” that merit close attention to their currency practices

WASHINGTON (Reuters): The US Treasury Department on Friday said Vietnam, Switzerland and Taiwan tripped its thresholds for possible currency manipulation under a 2015 US trade law, but refrained from formally branding them as manipulators.
In the first semi-annual foreign exchange report issued by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the Treasury said it will commence “enhanced engagement” with Taiwan and continue such talks with Vietnam and Switzerland after the Trump administration labeled the latter two as currency manipulators in December.
The Treasury said Taiwan, Vietnam and Switzerland exceeded 2015 currency thresholds during 2020 – a more than $ 20 billion bilateral trade surplus with the United States, foreign currency intervention exceeding 2% of gross domestic product and a global current account surplus exceeding 2% of GDP.
Despite the finding, it found insufficient evidence under an earlier 1988 law to conclude that Vietnam, Switzerland or Taiwan are manipulating exchange rates to gain a trade advantage or prevent balance of payments adjustments.
“For calendar year 2020, we have not made a finding regarding the manipulation designation,” a Treasury official told reporters, adding: “We don’t view this as a mixed message.” The move takes some pressure off Switzerland and Vietnam by lifting the manipulator designation for at least six months.
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) denied it manipulates the franc and said the report will not alter its monetary policy. “In view of the economic situation and the ongoing high value of the Swiss franc, the SNB remains ready to intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary,” it said.
An official at Taiwan’s central bank said the US decision against applying the manipulator label showed continued good communication between Taipei and Washington on the issue and that US authorities understood Taiwan’s “special situation.” Taiwan’s tech-focused exports to the United States, including laptops and semiconductors, soared in 2020 due to the work-from-home boom sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.
In a statement on Saturday, the State Bank of Vietnam said it will continue to pursue a flexible exchange rate policy that is managed in a way to contain inflation, ensure macro-economic stability and not to create an unfair trade advantage.
Vietnam’s foreign ministry said in a later statement it welcomed the Treasury’s decision, adding: “Vietnam will maintain dialogues and consultancy with the US over this issue.” A Treasury official said it was possible for countries to meet the tests under the “mechanical” 2015 law and not be manipulating their currency to boost exports.
He said the report’s findings took into account the massive trade and capital flow distortions of the pandemic and the fiscal and monetary policy choices governments took in response.
Without the pandemic, the results would have likely been quite a bit different, including for the three economies that hit the engagement triggers, the official added.
The Treasury report also said the COVID-19 crisis was likely to continue to affect current account positions over the next year as recoveries accelerated in some economies and lagged in others, adding that these changes were cause for concern.
“Treasury is working tirelessly to address efforts by foreign economies to artificially manipulate their currency values that put American workers at an unfair disadvantage,” Yellen said in a statement.
The enhanced engagement includes formal talks to urge Vietnam, Switzerland and Taiwan to develop plans with specific actions to address underlying causes of currency undervaluation and external imbalances, the Treasury said.
The talks will also help the Treasury determine the reasons for the three trading partners to make substantial currency market interventions.
For Taiwan, it said it would initiate enhanced engagement in line with the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. It expects those talks to help determine if Taiwan manipulated its currency under the 1988 law.
The Treasury said no other major US trading partner met the relevant 1988 or 2015 legislative criteria for currency manipulation or enhanced analysis during the review period.
It urged China to improve transparency regarding its foreign exchange intervention activities, the policy objectives of its exchange rate management regime, the relationship between the central bank and foreign exchange activities of the State-owned banks, and its activities in the offshore yuan market.
It also said it found 11 economies warrant placement on its “Monitoring List” of major trading partners that merit close attention to their currency practices: China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Ireland, Italy, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Mexico. All except Ireland and Mexico were included in the December 2020 report to Congress.
Reaction in the foreign exchange market was muted, with the Swiss franc modestly stronger and the Mexican peso only slightly weaker.
Thailand’s central bank said it did not see an impact on business flows or its ability to implement macroeconomic policies to safeguard domestic stability after remaining on the US monitoring list.
The Bank of Thailand maintains the country has never used the exchange rate as a tool to gain an unfair trade advantage, Assistant Governor Chantavarn Sucharitakul said in a statement.
Thierry Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Group, said: “This strikes me as a political decision, not a rules-based decision,” adding the Treasury appeared to be trying to determine the intent of foreign exchange policies.
“It sounds like the administration is trying not to offend allies here... those allies that are going to be most important in containing China,” Wizman said.

Supports Central Bank’s ‘Matarata QR’ event, promoting cashless transactions through ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’


BOC conducted a specialised LANKAQR program on 3 April, supporting the Matara-leg of CBSL’s ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ campaign which was kicked off with an event on the same day. 
A country-wide promotion campaign commenced last year with the intent of introducing LANKAQR as the norm for mobile phone and digital payments, CBSL’s ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ initiative has made steady progress in furthering the cause of a cashless, digital-based society alongside improved financial inclusion in Sri Lanka.
Hosted at St. Mary’s Convent, Matara, BOC’s ‘Matara QR’ event drew the participation of representatives from leading financial institutions associated with the LANKAQR initiative, together with BOC officials including DGM Sales and Channel Management Priyal Silva, AGM Southern Province Ajith Karunarathne, and AGM Digital Products Promotion K.P. Mallika. 
The BOC’s ‘Matara QR’ effort, as with previous ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ support initiatives held by BOC in Colombo, Galle, and Kandy, focused on progressing the CBSL program’s vision of introducing and promoting digital transactions as the new standard countrywide.
Developed by CBSL, LANKAQR is a common Quick Response (QR) code standard, and widely adopted by the country’s leading banks and financial institutions following the CBSL-issued national directive last year, it will allow them to offer their customers quick, safe and low-cost digital payments to merchants and service providers, using digital payment apps and platforms. 
The improved payment conveniences facilitated through QR-based digital payments will enable a range of benefits to individual customers and businesses as well. While providing customers anytime, anywhere payment capabilities, the system also offers real-time transaction conveniences to merchants including SMEs, which will assist in developing a richer economic space in towns country-wide. 
BOC’s ‘Matara QR’ program held in line with CBSL’s wider ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ initiative, helped create greater awareness on what QR payments involve and the numerous benefits they offer both individual customers and small businesses, allowing for improved digital adoption and inclusion in the Matara locale. BOC has become the largest acquirer and issuer of QR transactions in Sri Lanka recording Rs. 112 m transactions during the first two months in year 2021.

Continues to sustain and boost critical SME sector








SDB Bank Chairman Lakshman Abeysekera


 





SDB Bank CEO Thilak Piyadigama




The year 2020 proved to be one of unprecedented economic change across the globe and in Sri Lanka, presenting significant challenges in all industries, particularly impacting the banking and financial services sector. 
Alongside the Government and Central Bank-led economic revival measures mandated industry-wide on account of COVID-19, including credit moratoriums and policy rate reductions, SDB Bank maintained a strong focus on digital transformation which helped them overcome the pandemic’s negative impact rapidly. The bank placed equal emphasis on non-performing advances management and streamlining processes to enhance efficiencies.
Identified by the bank as essential parameters in resuscitating the nationally critical SME sector, as it single-handedly accounts for 52% of total GDP, the bank transformed rapidly and went on to record a profit of Rs. 835 million in 2020, amounting to a massive 229% increase in annual profit from 2019. 
Their strong performance was impacted heavily by numerous SDB Bank-led initiatives in SME and co-operative development, including the partnership with The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) to provide free, one-on-one expert mentorship and technical knowledge to SMEs through a team of fully-qualified accountants, with SDB performing the key role of funding partner. The bank’s partnerships with MILCO in supporting dairy farmers and DIMO to extend support to agri-farmers through leasing promotions to secure agricultural equipment and machinery, represent programs of equal importance as part of their SME focus.
Active financial support of this nature offered to SMEs in far-flung areas, in addition to strengthening their entrepreneurial efforts plus helping them overcome the economic challenges experienced in 2020, assisted the bank in maintaining a Gross Non-Performing Advances Ratio of 4.54% in 2020, considerably lower than the industry figures for the period. This positive impact on financial performance has helped them maintain their SME-focused initiatives, thereby boosting the national economy considerably.
The bank similarly realised Net Interest Income of Rs. 6.1 billion, displaying an 8% growth from the previous year despite the prevailing lower lending rates and the associated reduction in customer deposits rates. Of equal significance, the bank displayed a Net Interest Margin of 5.89% even with slowing down of borrowing and the extended loan moratoriums granted.
Parallelly, the bank’s revamped digital efforts were aided by its successful completion of the first-ever digital rights issue by a Colombo Stock Exchange-listed entity — officially recognised as the first digital share subscription to be oversubscribed — allowing them to raise a substantial volume of funds and provide low-cost funding to key customer segments. 
The lower cost structure realised has allowed for a lower cost per customer and improved profitability, reflected in the 229% rise in profit from the previous year, also influenced by the bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio of 13.38%, which is well above the statutory Capital requirement indicating the bank’s high perceived safety. 
Parallelly, the bank’s strong relationships with international finance partners such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Dutch development bank FMO, and Japan-based finance services institution SBI Holdings, have afforded assistance in the bank’s governing framework through the prevailing economic climate. Together with the bank’s independent growth initiatives, these partnerships contributed to the achieving of Total Assets of Rs. 129 billion and Total Equity of Rs. 9.9 billion in 2020, amounting to a 20% balance sheet growth from 2019. SDB bank’s consistent growth and resulting reduction in overall finance cost has allowed the bank to offer a higher quality of banking services to its significant out-of-city client base, reinforcing its mission of providing contemporary banking solutions for the masses. 
The bank has realised a position of strength to drive considerable value for all its stakeholders amidst the crisis, achieving an ROA of 1.19% representing a significant rise from 2019, indicative of the bank’s enterprising use of resources to generate greater income. The bank also realised an ROE of 9.49%, considerably higher than the previous year, displaying the bank’s generation of value through the investments made. Their healthy performance also draws from a 55% impairment reduction from 2019, improving their asset value considerably. 
SDB Bank’s strong showing in 2020 across all key performance indicators, on the back of its digital transformation efforts which helped mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19, while improving the bank’s profitability and sustaining the SME sector despite the challenges experienced, further strengthens their position as the apex banking entity in the SME space and a key partner of national development.

How other countries can catch up with the US
The analysis explains why the United States is a dominant force in the stock exchange market while rivals economies are still trailing. According to the research report: “Based on the US dominance of the stock market, it is evident that no country is posing a real challenge. For other markets to catch up, they need to be innovative and provide a conducive environment that will attract high valuation foreign companies. At the same time, they need an environment that retains local companies.” The report also highlights that the New York Stock Exchange is the largest exchange globally with a market cap of $ 25.62 trillion, followed by Nasdaq-US at $ 19.51 trillion, while Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing ranks third at $ 6.76 trillion. The Shanghai Stock Exchange ranks fourth with a market cap of $ 6.55 trillion, while Japan Stock Exchange caps the top five categories at $ 6.55 trillion.
Other top stock exchanges globally include Euronext ($ 5.07 trillion), Shenzhen Stock Exchange ($ 4.83 trillion), London Stock Exchange ($ 3.83 trillion), TMX Group ($ 2.62 trillion), and National Stock Exchange of India ($ 2.55 trillion).
From the list of top exchanges, the US also dominates thanks to the country’s ability to attract foreign players. The reports state that: “Overall, trading on US-based exchanges eliminates some investor concerns. Before listing, foreign companies must comply with Securities and Exchanges Commission guidelines offering a more transparent process. Unlike regions like China, most companies tend to be sceptical due to uncertainty and control from the state.” At the moment it is evident the US will not lose its position anytime soon.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Prof. W.D. Lakshman, Deputy Governor T.M.J.Y.P. Fernando, Assistant Governor J.P.R. Karunaratne, SNBFI Dept. Addl. Director R.M.C.H.K. Jayasinghe, SNBFI Dept. Additional Director A.P. Liyanapatabendi at the handing over event of ‘Code of Conduct of Licensed Finance Companies Sri Lanka’ by FHA Council members at the Central Bank headquarters on 18 March


Introduces sustainability mandate as well to contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goals


The Finance Houses Association of Sri Lanka (FHA) the apex body of all registered finance companies has announced the introduction of its revised Self-Regulation Code which has been voluntarily practiced by member companies over a long period of time, but has to be adapted to changing times.
The timely revisions to the Code were effected with a view to maintain the highest standards on strategic and business operations in Sri Lanka’s Non-Banking Financial and Leasing Institutions (NBFI) sector. 
The FHA collective of 39 Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs) is the driver of financial inclusion of Sri Lanka’s MSME sector which has a large footprint in the Bottom of the Pyramid segment of the country. The MSME sector is no less than the backbone of Sri Lankan economy involving over 70% of businesses in Sri Lanka, providing employment for 45% of the labour force and generating 52% of GDP.
Titled ‘Code of Conduct of Licensed Finance Companies Sri Lanka’ the updated instrument was handed over to the Governor of Central Bank of Sri Lanka Prof. W.D. Lakshman and Bank’s officials by FHA Council members on 18 March at the Central Bank premises.
FHA Chairman Niroshan Udage elaborated: “FHA’s time tested gentlemen’s agreement that was codified some time ago needed revisions and updates as per the requirements of today’s changing times. 
The overall objectives of updating the Code were to comply with all current regulatory and legal requirements while adhering to industry best practices. We take humble pride in the fact that the Code was not imposed on our sector by any authority but was self-introduced by all FHA members on their own will, which demonstrates the members’ strong commitment to sectoral integrity and their social responsibility.”
On 18 March members of FHA also handed over their Sustainability Mandate to the Governor of Central Bank Prof. W.D. Lakshman and top officials of the Bank. 
“The purpose of the Sustainability Mandate is to serve as the guideline for the LFCs to integrate sustainability principles holistically into their businesses, enabling sustainable value creation through their own financing approaches, in line with defined sustainability guidelines that would ultimately contribute towards national sustainability agenda and UN Sustainable Development Goals,” said Chairman Niroshan Udage. “As a growing number of financial institutions in the world are adopting policies, systems, and lending practices that reduce the environmental impact of their operational footprint, it is time Sri Lankan LFCs actively follow suit. We are making sure that financing practices for economic development shall not come at the cost of our ecosystems and our future generations,” added Chairman Niroshan Udage.
Romani de Silva, speaking on behalf of the FHA sub-committee that overlooks sustainability said: “Adopting the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) would be significant to every finance company operating in Sri Lanka’s NBFI sector. 
The good news is that many members of FHA already subscribe to at least three SDG guidelines by default; the SDGs are ‘No Poverty’, ‘Zero Hunger’ and ‘Good Health and Well Being’  through their activities in serving customers at the base of the pyramid. 
Therefore, Sri Lanka FHA has ‘already arrived’ towards SDGs to some extent. Such facts as our member companies already serving the MSMEs and the Bottom of the Pyramid market and some even investing in Sri Lanka’s Social Enterprises also testifies to FHA members’ active engagement with Sustainability. I further believe that espousing global sustainable value creation initiatives by our member companies would be a viable way to adopt best practices in this regard.”

Qatar (The Peninsula): Doha Bank recently hosted a meeting with a Sri Lankan delegation which was headed by Sri Lanka’s State Minister of Money, Capital Market, and State Enterprise Reforms Ajith Nivard Cabraal and the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka N.W.G.R.D. Nanayakkara. 
During the meeting, Doha Bank CEO Dr. R. Seetharaman highlighted the key developments in Qatar which includes the country’s recent LNG expansion plans.
He said: “Qatar Petroleum’s (QP) North Field East Project (NFE) is expected to start production in the fourth quarter of 2025. The NFE project represents the first phase of LNG expansion in Qatar, while the second phase is referred to as the North Field South Project (NFS).
With an expected production start date in 2027, the NFS project involves the construction of two additional mega LNG trains and associated offshore and onshore facilities. According to IMF April 2021, Qatar’s economy is expected to grow by 2.4% in 2021,” Seetharaman said.
He also gave insights on Sri Lankan economy. Citing the IMF April 2021 report, he said that the Sri Lankan economy is expected to grow by 4% in 2021. Sri Lanka’s recent monetary policy has maintained low interest rates and the policy rate at which money is injected overnight at 5.5%, and the rate at which excess money is deposited at 4.5%. The country’s fiscal policy for 2021 has a deficit of 8.9% of GDP.
He added that Sri Lanka’s Vision 2025 has given thrust on FDI and exports, and to improve per-capita income. Seetharaman went on to reiterate the growing bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Qatar.
“Sri Lanka has enjoyed close ties with Qatar, with over 120,000 Sri Lankans. There are more than 200 Sri Lankan companies established in partnership with the Qatari side. Doha Bank entered into agreements with the four biggest Sri Lankan banks to facilitate the remittances from Qatar to Sri Lanka.
“Doha Bank also plays an important role in facilitating trade finance opportunities between Qatar and Sri Lanka and has seen substantial growth in the past few months.
“Qatari businessmen should explore the huge investment opportunities in Sri Lanka and establish business partnerships and alliances with their Sri Lankan counterparts. Many Sri Lankan companies are looking to take part in Qatari projects and establish joint ventures in all sectors.
“Qatar Airways and Sri Lankan Airlines had also previously announced a significant codeshare expansion in December 2019.” 
Also speaking during the event, Cabraal gave an insight on investment opportunities in Sri Lanka.
He said: “Construction of new terminals, supporting logistic establishments, ship building and repairing industries, developing minor ports and connectivity, expanding related leisure activities and marine support industries are some of the areas which offer potential.” Nanayakkara added that the delegation had a fruitful tour in Qatar which has opened several avenues for Sri Lanka. Meeting with Seetharaman was also very useful, he added.

The Pathfinder Foundation (PF) together with Visa Inc. are conducting a series of discussions on promoting digitalisation and financial inclusion in Sri Lanka. 
The PF, a non-partisan research and advocacy think tank is known to play a catalytic role in research and analysis aimed at contributing to economic policy reforms in Sri Lanka. In this endeavour, over the years, the Foundation has established a wide and effective network of academics, experts, senior government officials and policymakers to promote economic reform in the country. 
Visa Inc., along with its partners, have been working towards promoting digitalisation and financial inclusion in the country. Their objective is to work towards introducing new technologies like contactless payments in Sri Lanka. However, the current pandemic has brought to the fore some key issues as well as opportunities and Visa would like to utilise this to create awareness and support digitalisation in sectors, which are still heavily reliant on cash. Visa believes that areas such as MSME, transit and tourism will play a critical role in determining the recovery of Sri Lankan economy. 
This initiative is spearheaded by Pathfinder Foundation Senior Visiting Fellow and renowned banker Rajendra Theagarajah, who, with his 36 years of experience in banking, both locally and internationally, is a veteran in the financial services sector. 
Together the Pathfinder Foundation and VISA will conduct discussions with key stakeholders from industry, government, regulatory and think tanks in areas such as Micro, Small, Medium Enterprises and Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME and SMEs); AgriTech and FinTech and Tourism. The workshops would investigate opportunities for Lankan businesses to develop themselves into strong sustainable enterprises playing their intended role in contributing to real economic growth in Sri Lanka. 
The final output of the discussion series will be a roadmap summarising the problems facing the sector, possible solutions, role of the policy makers and role for private sector and MSME/SMEs, AgriTech and FinTech and tourism. 
The roadmap will be presented to key Government officials. The findings unlike many forums will not lament on subsidies and need for more protection but will examine the real ‘pain points’, highlight past successes stories that have overcome hurdles even during extreme domestic downturns so that a positive message of ‘can do’ rather than ‘why cannot do’ will be presented.

The largest financial institution in the country with over 80 years of sustainable growth together with the Sri Lankan community, the Bank of Ceylon has always borne the interest of enhancing socio-economic wellbeing of all its stakeholders. 
The bank recognises this award with honour, as an accreditation to this commitment. Organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce to empower corporate citizens who sustain industry best practices with emphasis on aspects of People, Planet and Profit for corporate sustainability, this event is one of the leading corporate award ceremonies in the country.

The main award came along with one triple bottom line award and two other category awards: Triple Bottom Line Award for Economic Sustainability (Profit) and Category Winner for Employee Relations, and Category Winner of Financial Performance. 
During the year 2019, the bank has reported 8% YoY growth in its income and 10% YoY growth in its net profit. The bank has reported an 11% YoY reduction in its Profit Before Tax (PBT), mainly showcasing the impact to the financial industry stemming from the badly hit economy resulted from the unexpected Easter Sunday Attacks. 
The bank was able to retain stable and focus on helping out badly hit tourism and related sector businesses via loan restructuring, rescheduling and administrating the CBSL introduced moratorium. Even with low margins, the bank showed a growth in its business volumes during the year and reported YoY increase in assets, deposits and loans by 6%, 13% and 8% respectively.
Growing its business continuously with significant YoY improvements and reporting a growth in baseline profit especially in a highly-volatile environment with many unexpected challenges, showcase the adoptability and the soundness of strategies incorporated.
The bank has always been vigilant in distribution of its value creation to entire country with special attention to socio-economically disadvantaged areas. In terms of resource allocation, the Bank of Ceylon has a most widespread branch network consisting of 646 branches and 1,361 ATM/CDM/CRM digital contact points, 159 branches and 412 contact points are in economically disadvantaged areas.
Altogether the bank has the strength of over 2,000 physical customer touch points spread across the country. Apart from physical branches BOC also has established a strong digital channel presence and played a pivotal role in bridging fin-tech gap between urban and rural communities. Benefits of modernisation of branches and the technology upgrades such as software, network, etc. are mostly aimed at rural and marginal communities. The bank’s roots are strongly bonded to every corner of the national economy ranging from rural sector to blue chip conglomerates and the State sector. Hence, its contribution to the national economy is substantial and vital. Bank of Ceylon is one of the largest contributors to the national coffers in terms of tax and dividends. Bonding with the Sri Lankan community with a set of common values being a good corporate citizen is woven to the core since inception. Observing United Nations’ commitment to sustainable development, urging its member states to comply with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Bank of Ceylon has considered incorporating these objectives when formulating its business strategies. This approach has allowed the bank to achieve better performance in People, Planet and Profit (3Ps) of sustainability. 
With this consideration, the bank was able to comprehensively address almost all aspects of corporate sustainability in its own way. The bank has been able to achieve more measurable/productive results by implementing these initiatives and at each step, BOC has been creating value for Economic Sustainability, Social Sustainability and Environment Sustainability for itself and all stakeholders involved.

Avurudu is a time of culture and tradition and among the many traditional activities that take place, ‘Avurudu ganu denu’ holds a special place in the hearts of many. Individuals would often take part in ‘ganu denu’, exchanging money at an auspicious time, with the belief that their entire year would then become prosperous. 
Since 2020, the Avurudu traditions were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, where the daily lives were disrupted on a global scale. The pandemic hit the small and medium scale businesses and locals in Sri Lanka as well. As the global economy is on a slow but steady recovery from the effects of the pandemic, the SMEs play a critical role.
Understanding this, NDB Bank tied up with the National Craft Council in order to celebrate our local craftsmen by providing a lending hand. Hence, this Avurudu season NDB ‘Kohetath Kalin Kohatath Kalin’ returns, with a ‘Prosperity Clay Pot’ as this year’s gift for the loyal customers who perform ganu denu with NDB Bank. This Prosperity Clay Pot was crafted and wrapped by the skilful hands of our local handicraftsmen. 
Banks and other financing institutions have a tremendous responsibility in supporting and empowering SMEs, propelling them towards sustained growth. With this in mind, NDB has thus taken steps to bear the cost of the gift to provide a lending hand in this endeavour.
NDB has made considerable strides in the support of SMEs and upcoming entrepreneurs, both male and female. NDB’s Jayagamu Sri Lanka initiative and Sri Lanka Vanithaabhimana played a crucial role in this. The Bank considers this one of the initial steppingstones in the journey of uplifting our own people who try to take our traditional crafts to the next level.
NDB was crowned as Sri Lanka’s Best Bank 2021 by the prestigious Global Finance Magazine of USA, fresh on the heels of being recognised as The Bank of the Year Sri Lanka, by The Banker Magazine UK. NDB Bank is the fourth largest listed bank in Sri Lanka and the parent company of the NDB Group.

Sarvodaya Development Finance (SDF), has won global recognition as the fastest growing development finance company in Sri Lanka, at the UK-based, Global Banking and Finance Review Awards 2021. SDF is the financial services arm of the Sarvodaya Movement.
The international award, which is valued throughout the global banking and financial community, recognises companies in the financial sector that specialise and excel in their chosen field. Nominations are reviewed for suitability and the judging panel, comprising a research team, an editor and a publisher, select a winner. The high level of global competitiveness in applications and independent judging process makes the Global Banking and Finance Review Awards a globally prestigious vote of recognition. 
This international recognition of SDF as the fastest growing development finance company in Sri Lanka, reflects SDF’s contributions towards its customer segments over the years, and in particular during 2020, when SDF extended extensive support for Sri Lanka’s SMEs. While continuing to serve all customer segments during the unexpected emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, by facilitating uninterrupted availability of financial solutions for enterprises, entrepreneurs, individuals and their families, SDF was quick to respond to the urgent needs of SMEs during this time. 
Sri Lanka’s SMEs were the most vulnerable to market shocks, including the sudden and total loss of orders and supplies, and experienced a real threat to their survival during the prolonged periods of national and global lockdowns. Instead of forsaking the struggling SMEs during these dark months, SDF has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with its entrepreneurs and supported them both psychologically as well as financially, by immediately allowing them to benefit from the repayment moratorium, while also assisting them to develop recovery plans.  
SDF’s customer welfare approach, has encouraged many customers to return for financial services, which has resulted in an unprecedented growth in company assets and profits. As a financial services provider, SDF has created value in all aspects of its services, and in particular in developing the businesses and wellbeing of customers, while safeguarding envisaged cash inflows and outflows. Therefore, SDF firmly believes this approach has made SDF stand out from other financial services providers, to become the fastest growing development finance company in Sri Lanka. 
As a member of the Sarvodaya family, SDF has traditionally adopted a customer centric approach in its service delivery, while emphasising financial support for sustainable businesses that do not have adverse social and environmental impacts. In its role as a financial services provider, SDF also values entrepreneurship, particularly rural entrepreneurship, as essential for the growth and prosperity of Sri Lanka’s economy. 
Therefore, SDF has developed and delivered many value-added services in tandem with its specialised financial products, to assist SMEs develop markets and business opportunities, including technical training programs and special market development events. These additional services, coupled with competitively priced financial services, have supported the gradual growth of many rural business ventures from micro level, to small, and then, medium status. 
The linkages with Sarvodaya Sharmadana Societies, together with the strategic investments in modern ICTs, made it possible for SDF to reach out to grassroots rural entrepreneurs in this time of need. 
Looking beyond COVID-19, SDF is ready to enhance its financial services by reaching deeper into the Sri Lankan rural economies to encourage a faster overall economic recovery. SDF’s business policy is to fuel economic growth by channelling credit, and other support services, for environmentally friendly, sustainable business models across the country that contribute towards environmental conservation, while also facilitating quality of life improvements for communities as a whole. SDF’s highly trained and motivated workforce, backed by modern digital technologies, is poised to drive this development drive towards its objective.

REUTERS: Elevated domestic prices and renewed coronavirus restrictions due to a surge in infections dulled physical gold purchases in India, while China stepped up bullion imports as demand gradually rebooted.
“Retail demand has been falling in many regions due to restrictions on the movement of people,” said Ashok Jain, Proprietor of Mumbai-based gold wholesaler Chenaji Narsinghji.
On Friday, local gold futures were trading around INR 47,000 per 10 grams after rising to INR 47,279 on Thursday, the highest since mid-February.
Many states such as Maharashtra, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have imposed local curbs to arrest the spread of the coronavirus.
Dealers were charging a premium of up to $4 an ounce this week over official domestic prices, inclusive of 10.75% import and 3% sales levies, up from the last week’s $3.
Jewellers were making moderate purchases despite weak retail demand, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a bullion importing bank.
In China, the world’s biggest gold consumer, premiums of $7-$9 an ounce were charged over benchmark spot gold prices, compared with $7-$10 an ounce last week.
“I think what’s keeping the premiums in check is the recent news about onshore banks being allowed to import more gold by the People’s Bank of China,” said StoneX Group analyst Yingtao Jin.
China has given commercial banks permission to import large amounts of gold into the country, five sources familiar with the matter said.
Premiums of around $1.8 an ounce were being charged in Singapore, said Arihant Jewellers Managing Director Raghu Kedia, adding domestic demand remained slow, although more gold was flowing into China via Hong Kong and even Dubai.
In Hong Kong, premiums charged were $0.50-$2 an ounce versus $0.50-$1.80 last week.
In Japan, gold was sold between flat to a premium of $0.50, compared with premiums of $0.5-$1 last week.

As part of its digital transformation roadmap, NDB’s NEOS is regularly updated to reflect customer demand for personalisation and ease of use. 
The launch of NEOS was the fore runner which enabled the bank to launch the NDB NEOS Online Banking platform in April 2020, during the peak of Sri Lanka’s COVID-19 crisis. The NDB NEOS Online Banking has garnered popularity nation-wide as a state-of-the-art digital banking platform, with absolute connectivity to all of NDB’s banking services especially during the lockdown period. 
Meanwhile, during such a time where minimum contact with others is in the best interests of every individual, NDB introduced NEOS Pay, a QR payment method in which customers can make payments to merchants, pay bills and make a host of other transactions via the same platform. The NEOS Phygital Branches, Cash Recycle Machines and Bank2U propositions together with the NEOS App and Online Banking make the totality of the NDB digital offering.

Bank also offers microfinance loans to develop selected businesses

Standard Chartered Sri Lanka announced the completion of a two-year multi-stakeholder community project undertaken jointly with Chrysalis to provide financial literacy training and micro finance loans to women and youth residents in the country’s tea estates. The project saw the completion of a long-term financial literacy training of 129 women and youth, and loans provided to 33 business ventures of estate residents.
Conceptualised as a project to build capabilities and enhance financial management skills, Standard Chartered Sri Lanka worked closely with Chrysalis on identifying the beneficiaries from Hatton and the Uva region. Tea plantation women and youth were given training in financial skills and business management, in addition to allowing access to microfinance loans so that they could embark on business ventures for additional income and gain greater control over their household income and decision making. 
Standard Chartered also engaged Hatton National Bank (HNB) as its local banking partner to accommodate loans for qualified recipients by evaluating all individual entrepreneurs. As a partner, HNB performed necessary field visits and disbursed and followed up on loan recoveries in 9 estates in Hatton and the Uva region.
Speaking on the completion of the initiative, Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Bingumal Thewarathanthri said, “The financial education and entrepreneurship project we embarked on with Chrysalis was aimed at increasing the financial knowledge of the women and youth of the overlooked estate sector, enabling them to create business ventures, providing them with additional income and greater autonomy. As a business, Standard Chartered seeks to ensure that the financing provided by us goes towards supporting the economy and creating social development, and it is a matter of pride that our investment in communities go above and beyond the financial factor.”
Chrysalis is a Sri Lankan organisation working to empower women and youth by fostering inclusive growth. Working in tea estates through community development forums, Chrysalis identified recipient communities, spread awareness of the project, mobilised target audiences and maintained relationships with the grassroots communities.
“Women and youth in the estate sector are a valuable yet an extremely vulnerable part of our society, in whose case financial illiteracy and lack of income opportunities serve as severe limiting factors. Our work, in partnership with Standard Chartered Bank, has indirectly benefited close to 15,000 people as a result of women and youth increasing their financial literacy and actively engaging in community development. This is in addition to those who started up businesses that now employ others and foster entrepreneurship within the community,” stated Chrysalis Chief Executive Officer Ashika Gunasena, commenting on the project and its far-reaching impact.

If one were to go back in time and take a look at how the culture of communities in Sri Lanka used to function, you will surely stumble upon an interesting tale. This tale is one that is woven securely together with the qualities of care, concern and of coming together to better the lives of each other. 
Regardless of the individual challenges that these people had to face, they had one noble objective. Supporting and helping their neighbours to overcome challenges without expecting anything in return was of paramount importance to their societal function.
This humble concept called ‘Aththama’ still exists within the DNA of all Sri Lankans, no matter the background. Symbolising unity and emotional bonds that reach far beyond family, the concept of Aththama was present in almost every societal function.
Rather interestingly, Aththama and its ideals were also of key importance to ensuring that communal events and functions succeeded within our local communities. One such example of this is when a marriage takes place.
Even back in the day, Sri Lankan people would want to dress their best for such celebrations. Donning silver jewellery (this was long before gold saw any use in our economy) was viewed as the ideal way to mark a special occasion.
However, many did not have the financial means to own jewellery of their own. This is where the importance of one individual comes to light. Every community had one individual who would have numerous silver items at their disposal.
Referred to as ‘heneh mamas’ or ‘ridhi nandas’, most of the silver contained within a community was concentrated among these people. So, when a special occasion came around, people who needed silver jewellery would pay them a visit.
After choosing the items that they would like to wear, the ridhi nanda or heneh mama would happily allow the person to borrow them with only the promise of its return with no extra cost. However, as a courtesy, the items would be returned with a small gift known as a ‘hilawwa’. This system of borrowing is known as a ‘Ridhi Aththama’.
These age-old traditions have now eroded away by the changing sands of time. Soon after the introduction of currency, this process was looked at as a mere economic function and out went the traditional binding values.
The concept of Aththama was once the foundation of how Sri Lankan people trusted and did everything as a collective. Life was ideal and harmonious as the entire community came together as an extended family to help each other in times of need.
With this concept in mind, Pan Asia Bank, the truly Sri Lankan bank has decided to enrich and renew our society by bringing back these long forgotten values via a unique borrowing proposition centred on the concept of Aththama.
Pan Asia Bank has understood that now more than ever, the people of this country need to be reminded of this truly Sri Lankan value of helping each other. We have grown as a society because of this warm and generous tradition of helping each other, so why not try and revive it among ourselves?

“We are delighted that as a brand new entrant to the Unit Trust Mutual Fund business, the Softlogic Money Market Fund received an exceptional rating of ICRA SL A. When managing external funds we felt that showing return against risk is imperative to prospective investors as pure-play yield comparison is simply not informative enough to our investor base. We are keen on educating our investors on the value, transparency and significance of this external rating by ICRA through all our client communications,” stated Softlogic Invest Chief Executive Officer and Director Niloo Jayatilake.
Launched in July 2020, Softlogic Money Market Fund is an open-ended Unit Trust Fund approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC). 
The fund invests in government treasury bills, bonds and other government securities, investment grade corporate debt securities such as debentures, commercial papers, securitisation papers and repurchase agreements with maturities of less than one year which can be readily convertible to cash.  The overall objective of the Fund is to earn a return of interest income while preserving investor capital and liquidity.
Commenting on the significance of the rating, Softlogic Invest Portfolio Manager Daham Hettiarachchi opined, 
“This outstanding rating signifies our attempt to deliver optimum returns given the current low-rate environment and COVID challenges. We adopt a more conservative strategy when allocating funds whilst ensuring that our unit holders are able to access attractive returns. With this approach, we are currently delivering a return well above traditional non-bank fixed deposit rates and savings rates. Therefore, our investors enjoy optimum yield compared to traditional NBFI fixed deposit rates whilst enjoying the flexibility of withdrawal at any time they want without any charges. We believe that customer convenience and access to funds is paramount to grow Industry volumes.”
ICRA Lanka’s mutual fund rating methodology is based on evaluating the inherent credit quality of the fund’s portfolio. Schemes with this rating are considered to have adequate degree of safety regarding timely receipt of payments from the investments that they have made.
 The credit risk ratings incorporate ICRA Lanka’s assessment of a debt fund’s published investment objectives and policies, its management characteristics, and the creditworthiness of its investment portfolio.
 The organisation reviews relevant fund information on an ongoing basis to support its published rating opinions.

Ernst and Young Financial Accounting Advisory Services Partner Rajith Perera




Ernst and Young in Sri Lanka (EY), successfully carried out an informative half-day training session for all Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) and Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs) on Integrated Stress Testing during pandemic and Pillar II Risk Measurement. 
The event was attended by many participants from banks including Chief Risk Officers, Finance Managers, Risk Managers, Compliance Managers and other individuals involved in Internal Capital Assessment Adequacy Process (ICAAP) from Finance and Risk teams. Timely response of EY team to a pertinent matter impacting LCBs and LSBs was highly commended by the participants. The discussion included the importance of integrated approach to stress testing incorporating pandemic impact and Pillar II Risk assessment and measurement.
Ernst and Young, Sri Lanka Financial Accounting Advisory Services Partner Rajith Perera facilitated the workshop. He shared his insights on challenges confronted by financial services sector when assessing regulatory capital post-pandemic era for ICAAP submission. The session also covered areas such as assessment and measurement of Pillar ii risks such as Liquidity Risk, Cybersecurity Risk and Reputational Risk including future developments which could carry a substantial impact to the financial services sector.
During his opening remarks for the session, Rajith stated, “Even though the larger exposure to stress on capital is due to Pillar I risks (minimum regulatory capital for credit and market and operational risk) financial institutions cannot underestimate the effects of the Pillar II risks (such as Liquidity Risk, Reputational Risk, Cyber Risk, etc.) which could intensify due to the adverse impacts of the pandemic. As a result, banks may not be able to rely on traditional stress testing and risk measurement techniques (locally and globally) resulting from economic slowdowns and pressures.” This led to the discussion of the importance of having a scientific approach to stress testing and sound risk management framework for Pillar II Risks. 
Discussion highlighted the common weaknesses seen in current practices of financial services such as stressing risks in isolation, limiting stress testing to sensitivity analysis, not considering the impact of macro-economic variables, lack of rationale for application of stress testing methodologies. To make stress testing relevant in current context, it was recommended to use unprecedented conditions resulting from COVID-19 pandemic scenario into Stress Testing. Further, it was emphasised that Modelling methodologies adopted by Banks should capture behaviour of macroeconomic variables along with hypothetical scenario definition and selection of macroeconomic factors based on balance sheet structure and risk profile of a bank. Rajith reiterated, “Stress testing should be dynamic and forward looking – i.e. factor-in business growth plans, structural shifts in funding profile, and capital strategies”. Conceptual Model for Market Risk and Scientific Methodology for Operational Risk Stress Testing was demonstrated to participants.
Further during the session, he covered how Banks could integrate Value at Risk (VaR) models to measure market risk exposures, He went on to elaborate that institutions owning VaR Systems have failed to integrate the output to ICAAP. Rajith was specific on the validation requirements of the VaR models prior to deployment as it can result in generating inconsistent loss exposures. Further during the session Rajith demonstrated how an institution could develop Parametric/Non-Parametric VaR models and demonstrated the VaR, a tool developed by the Financial Services Risk Management team of EY in Sri Lanka which has the capability to measure VaR exposures to equity instruments, fixed income instruments and derivative instruments to aid measurement of market risk.
Towards the latter part of the session Rajith turned the attention of the participants to identification, measurement and assessment of Pillar ii risks. He stated, “Risk management best practices are at the heart of Pillar II; Quantification of risks has become a more significant aspect of Pillar ii especially during the post pandemic and banks must undertake an ICAAP that looks at all risks to which the bank is exposed.” This led to a lively discussion on understanding risks such as Cybersecurity Risk and Reputational Risk. Here the benefits financial institutions can get by moving into a scoring-based approach to assess internal capital requirements was brought to light.

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in collaboration with Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) are hosting an exclusive session on ‘Why organisations worldwide and in Sri Lanka are adopting sustainability reporting using GRI Standards and how it benefits them’. This is an online session on 9 April starting at 10:00 a.m.
The GRI is an independent international standard-setting organisation that helps businesses and Governments worldwide understand and communicate their impact on critical sustainability issues such as climate change, human rights, governance and social well-being. 
The practice of disclosing sustainability information inspires accountability, helps identify and manage risks, and enables organisations to seize new opportunities. Reporting with the GRI Standards supports companies, public and private, large and small, to protect the environment and improve society, while at the same time thriving economically by improving governance and stakeholder relations, enhancing reputations and building trust. The GRI Standards help companies disclose relevant ESG information that support decisions in the best interest of investors and society at large. 
The 2020 KPMG Survey of Sustainability Reporting shows a record number of companies, spanning sectors and geographic regions, which are voluntarily choosing to disclose their sustainability impacts – with the GRI Standards the most widely used for reporting. Across all companies surveyed, the GRI Standards is the only sustainability reporting framework that can demonstrate widespread global adoption. Around three-quarters (73%) of the G250 and two-thirds (67%) of the N100 now use GRI. As per a research done by GRI – South Asia, 29% of the public listed companies (83 companies) are currently reporting using the GRI Standards in Sri Lanka.
GRI’s publication ‘Carrots & Sticks (C&S 2020)’ provides an analysis of the latest trends in reporting provisions. It reveals 614 reporting requirements and resources across over 80 countries, including Sri Lanka. In 2019, CSE published the ESG guidance document titled ‘Communicating Sustainability Version 02.’ 
As sustainability reporting becomes more widespread, regulators, investors as well as stock exchanges and industry bodies have started to encourage and even demand sustainability data from companies. This is free-of-charge and the registration link can be obtained by sending an email to chanuka@cse.lk

The merged entity will continue as AMF


Two of Sri Lanka’s oldest and most respected financial companies, Associated Motor Finance Company PLC (AMF) and Arpico Finance Company PLC (AFC) joined strengths officially at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) on 1 April. Months-long process for this landmark merger was officially completed in full compliance with the protocols. The merged entity will forge ahead as AMF, with the combined strengths of the two companies and a clear vision to rise high in Sri Lanka’s financial services industry. 
Speaking of this groundbreaking merger AMF Director/CEO T.M.A. Sallay had this to say: “We mark this historic occasion with great pride. The merger of capabilities, strengths and expertise of two esteemed finance institutes into one as AMF, gives us tremendous potential for the future. This also marks the opening of a new grand chapter for the valued stakeholders of both organisations whose best interest is always at our heart. Together, working as one passionate and dedicated team, we intend to revolutionise the finance industry through a progressive mix of products and services that always puts the interest of the customer first.” 
Both AMF and Arpico Finance being amongst the few oldest financial institutions in the country, each organisation brings a unique portfolio of strengths, expertise and professionals to the table, allowing the new entity to shape a truly diverse organisation. “This gives AMF an edge over the competition and places the company in an advantageous position with a wider product portfolio, serving to a wider clientele,” Sallay further stated. 
Established in 1951, Arpico Finance Company PLC boasts of a long and impressive track record, operating ten branches and offering a wide range of finance solutions including finance leasing, mortgage loans, personal loans, and acceptance of time and savings deposits. Associated Motor Finance Company PLC (AMF) was established in 1962 and operated through a branchless model, primarily catering to the two-wheeler leasing market. The new AMF plans to diversify into three and four-wheel leasing categories by leveraging on Arpico Finance’s expertise and geographic spread with 12 strategically located branches. This will enhance value through consolidating and administrating the operational infrastructures more efficiently while adding more value to all stakeholders. 
With a clear vision and definite plans, AMF has also invested in advanced IT systems amongst other things to empower the field force and to infuse greater efficiency. The company has made a concerted effort to partner fin-tech companies and technologies that design disruptive and path-breaking technologies that truly enhance convenience of customers. With everything in place, AMF is now ready to emerge as the new force in the finance sector of Sri Lanka. 
On another note, the importance of this merger cannot be overstated as it will greatly strengthen the local financial sector, especially in a time of global crisis. It will also usher in a new standard of transparency and accountability, thereby bringing stability to the market and giving investors better prospects for the future.

Conducted by Gary Cokins, expert on cost management and performance improvement in USA








Gary Cokins, CPIM



The Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA) will conduct a webinar on ‘Predictive Accounting: Driver-Based Budgeting and Rolling Financial Forecasts’ on Wednesday, 7 April
from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. via online Zoom platform. 
CMA Sri Lanka was established in 1999 with the technical support of CMA Canada (now CPA Canada) and the financial assistance of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) by its Founder Prof. Lakshman R. Watawala. The Institute of Certified Management Accountants (CMA) of Sri Lanka was thereafter incorporated in April 2009 as the National Professional Management Accounting Institution in Sri Lanka by Act of Parliament No. 23 of 2009 under the Ministry of Internal Trade and Cooperatives and then Industry and Commerce and now under Ministry of Finance. 
CMA Sri Lanka is member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) the global body for the accounting profession, South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA) the regional body for the South Asian Region and the Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants (CAPA) the accounting body for the Asian and Pacific region
The webinar will be conducted by Gary Cokins, who is an internationally recognised expert, speaker, and author in advanced cost management and performance improvement systems. He is the founder of Analytics-Based Performance Management, an advisory firm located in Cary, North Carolina at www.garycokins.com. Gary received a BS degree with honours in Industrial Engineering/Operations Research from Cornell University in 1971. He received his MBA from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management in 1974.
Gary Cokins’ presentation involves the shift from historical reporting to predictive costing such as capacity-sensitive driver-based rolling financial forecasts, what-if analysis, and marginal cost analysis (e.g., pricing). The annual budgeting process is being criticised as obsolete soon after it is published, prone to gamesmanship, cumbersome to consolidate cost centre spreadsheets, not being volume sensitive, and disconnected from the strategy. The challenge is how to resolve these deficiencies. It can be done through driver based expense projections also useful for decision analysis.
Cokins will deliberate on ‘How understand the deficiencies with the traditional annual budget’, ‘How to apply unit-level consumption rates with forecasts to project operational expenses’, ‘How to include strategic and risk mitigation projects in expense projections’, ‘How to apply “predictive accounting” for capacity-sensitive driver-based rolling financial forecasts, what-if analysis, and outsourcing decisions’ and ‘How to shift from bottom-up cost centre consolidations to top down modelling’.
The webinar will conclude with a question and answer session where participants will also have an opportunity to discuss practical applications and obtain clarifications via chat option. 
Those who wish to attend are requested to send an e-mail to: registrations@cma-srilanka.org.

Strong economic data from China and the US has helped propel world stocks to record highs. Credit: AAP 
 

LONDON (Reuters): World stocks hit record highs yesterday, supported by strong economic data from China and the US, while currency and bond markets paused for breath after a month of rapid gains in the dollar and Treasury yields.
Equities as measured by the 49-country spanning MSCI All Country World Index hit an all-time high as European stocks played catch-up with gains in Asia and Wall Street overnight in their first trading session since the Easter holiday.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index hit a record high after the open in Europe.
Profit-taking pushed Japan’s Nikkei down 1% and dragged on the Shanghai Composite.
The S&P 500 closed Monday at a record peak and futures dipped 0.2% yesterday.
On the heels of a bumper US jobs report last Friday, March data showed services activity hit a record high. China’s service sector has also gathered steam with the sharpest increase in sales in three months.
“We think investors should not fear entering the market at all-time highs,” said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer, UBS Global Wealth Management.
“We recommend continuing to position for the reflation trade as the economic recovery gathers pace - data released Friday showed US nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 in March, the biggest gain since August. “
The yield on benchmark 10-year US Treasuries fell to 1.7093%, while the dollar has mostly missed out on a big bounce from the strong data and held at $ 1.1819 per euro a day after posting its steepest drop since mid-March.
Elsewhere, Swiss lender Credit Suisse sought to draw a line under its exposure to the implosion of hedge fund Archegos Capital, announcing the debacle would cost it about $ 4.7 billion and two senior executives their jobs.
The steadying Treasury yields and dollar follow a charge higher over the first quarter, with an 83 basis point rise in 10-year yields, the biggest quarterly gain in a dozen years, and a 3.6% rise in the dollar index – the sharpest since 2018.
“Bonds have settled down now,” said Omkar Joshi, portfolio manager at Opal Capital Management in Sydney, after a hard and fast selloff. “I think markets can keep powering on from here.”
Minutes from the March meeting of the US Federal Reserve, due today, are the next focus for bond markets, although they will not address the most recent data surprises and markets have run far ahead of Fed projections for years of low rates.
Fed funds futures have priced in a hike next year while euro/dollar markets have it priced by December. “What needs to be tested is how the Fed reinforces and reassures on its flexible average inflation target policy,” said Vishnu Varathan, head economist at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.
“The dollar’s past few weeks of movement reflect markets moving ahead despite what the Fed has said.” Currencies were fairly quiet through the Asia session, and hung on to small gains on the dollar. The Australian dollar traded at $ 0.7647 after the Central Bank held policy settings steady, as expected.
The yen was a fraction softer at 110.21 per dollar, while sterling touched a two-and-a-half week high of $ 1.3919.
The dollar’s wobble helped oil prices recoup some losses suffered on Monday on worries a new wave of COVID-19 infections in Europe and India could curtail energy demand.
Brent crude futures rose 1.4% to $ 62.98 a barrel while US crude climbed 1.5% to $ 59.56 a barrel. Gold tacked on 0.2% to $ 1,732 an ounce.

Royce Delpechithra (left) receives solar panel policy from People’s Insurance Director and People’s Bank CEO/GM Ranjith Kodithuwakku (third from left). Also present are People’s Insurance Director and People’s Leasing CEO/GM Shamindra Marcellin 
(second from left), People’s Insurance CEO Deepal Abeysekera (second from right) and Head of Operations Jeewani Kariyawasam (right) 

In an effort to support the ongoing national-level initiatives of fostering sustainable and environmentally friendly energy production methods, Sri Lanka’s foremost non-life insurance firm, People’s Insurance PLC, has announced the launch of a special insurance coverage for solar panels mounted in homes, offices and solar parks across the country. 
As the number of solar panels installed in buildings and solar products in the country have seen a trend of exponential growth, year on year, the timely introduction of this insurance coverage seeks to mitigate the risk factor associated with roof mounted solar panels and solar products, as they are of high value investments. This cover seeks to give customers peace of mind, knowing that their investments in green energy generation are protected by one of the leading insurers in the country. 
The Basic Cover provides protection against fire, lightning, storms, cyclones, floods, earthquakes and accidental damage, inclusive of electrical extra covers. 
Much to the customer’s benefit, the insurer has also pledged more additional covers at no extra charge. These include the labour costs of debris removal if panels are damaged by an insured peril, the cost of removing and repositioning the solar panel system if the building or structure is damaged and the cost of transporting damaged panels to the service agent’s workshop. 
Known for its efforts in being an insurer that always goes the extra mile by keeping the customer’s best interests in mind, People’s Insurance will also cover the damages caused to panels by malicious acts of other individuals. Additionally, if a customer loses income due to perils mentioned above, that loss of revenue will also be covered by this special insurance scheme.  For those customers who wish to have their losses covered in case of an untimely theft of panels involving forced entry, riots, terrorist activities or electrical extras without visible burn marks can do so by paying a minimal premium.
Speaking at the launch of this cover, Manager – Fire and Miscellaneous Uvindu Pathirana had this to say: “Many Sri Lankans are looking towards producing and using energy in a sustainable manner. While Solar Panels are the ideal choice for this, people often hesitate because of the high cost and risks such as damage associated with solar panel usage. This is where we have stepped in to ensure that a customer’s investment in solar energy will be protected from perils via a cover developed specifically for this.”
This product goes hand in hand with the solar schemes offered by bank and financial institutions. Through these lone schemes individuals who seek to purchase solar panels can avail concessionary interest rates and people’s insurance supplements this effort.
As a socially responsible insurer, this special scheme is expected to fulfill the hopes of an environmentally and energy efficient Sri Lanka. In line with its values of serving customers with passion and sharing risks, this scheme will give many Sri Lankans the confidence to begin their soon to thrive journey in 
sustainability.
Many representatives from the People’s Group were present at the launch of the Solar Insurance product.

The 13th SLIBFI Conference organised by UTO EduConsult is scheduled to be held on 6 April from 3 to 6 p.m., once again on a virtual platform. 
Whilst online events may lack the ambience that a physical event provides, it nevertheless enables the inclusion of speakers from across the world. In fact, while the 12th Annual SLIBFI 2020 had a fair share of speakers from the US, Europe and other parts of Asia, SLIBFI 2021 is also expected to continue in the same vein, with not just speakers but also delegates from various countries expected to attend. 
Local delegates would form the core group of speakers and the esteemed list of speakers and panellists encompass a wide cross section of industries either directly involved with or working with some of the key stakeholders in the industry. 
The 13th SLIBFI Conference is being held with a renewed sense of optimism. The stock market performance, especially in the early part of the New Year, and the launch of a very successful IPO in March, may be an indication of what seems to be a rebound in the economy in 2021. 
With interest rates at levels not experienced for many years, there is also the emergence of new opportunities; the Asset Classes the market would focus on in order to generate a decent return; the continued impact of the ban on imports of various products, for instance motor vehicles; the Impact of AI, Robotics and Big Data on the banking sector and how digitisation is almost changing the face of banking at a much more rapid pace than originally envisaged. 
In fact, the pandemic triggered a chain of events and acted as a catalyst to increase the pace of digitisation across so many fronts. There is also the critical issue of how the IBF industry could assist in the development of the overall infrastructure of the country, especially to complement the current market for ISBs. These are all issues that are expected to be addressed at SLIBFI 2021, held for the 13th consecutive year on a virtual platform and on a free-to-attend basis, albeit by prior registration.

As Sri Lanka’s premier commercial bank with national duty at its core, People’s Bank this year celebrates 60 years of yeoman service of providing financial stability, growth, profitability and leading the way in empowering the lives and livelihoods of Sri Lankan citizens. 
Being a State-owned bank, People’s Bank, as its name depicts, is a people-centric financial institution that sets goals to be an exemplary corporate citizen. Despite challenging operating conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was a watershed year for People’s Bank as the bank turned a new chapter in its six-decade old history, passing the Rs. 2.2 trillion mark in assets and achieving a loan book of Rs. 1.6 trillion, as the bank’s loans and advances grew over Rs. 300 billion in 2020.
While growing its profile and financial strength as aforementioned, People’s Bank played and is continuing to play a special role in assisting the national economy, the Government and the people to overcome the challenges brought in by the pandemic. Aptly displaying that national duty precedes everything else, People’s Bank was in the forefront of the efforts to assist the people and businesses beset by the pandemic, while duly extending its assistance to the Government as a major State-owned bank.
In fact, the exceptional services of People’s Bank’s Director Board, senior management and the staff to the nation building process during the COVID-19 pandemic was acknowledged and appreciated by Secretary to the President Dr. P.B. Jayasundera during the Colombo Development Symposium held recently.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to soften the impact on the overall economy, the bank swiftly implemented a range of relief packages including moratoriums mandated by the Government and provided relief to over 480,000 customers, which is the highest number provided by a bank in Sri Lanka.  Also, the bank offered Rs. 13.7 billion worth of loans under the Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility, while offering over Rs. 10 billion in direct and indirect loans to the country’s agriculture sector, realising the importance of food security during a global pandemic. 
Further, the bank provided Rs. 14.2 billion worth of financial assistance to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) and Rs. 286 million in loans to women entrepreneurs during 2020. People’s Bank is currently in negotiation with the China-led Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB) for a $ 75 million to $ 100 million loan to be on-lent to COVID-19 hit local SMEs. 
Understanding its wider societal role, the bank also assisted teachers, actors, musicians and other artistes by giving loans worth over Rs. 330 million while assisting university students lending over Rs. 170 million to continue with their education, which included loans to purchase laptops. Further, as the bank of the people, People’s Bank extended over Rs. 6.1 billion in loans to retired/disabled officers of armed forces as at 31 December 2020. The bank has over one million senior citizen account holders, to whom a preferential rate of interest is being paid.
Meanwhile, People’s Bank extend Rs. 240 billion in local currency and further Rs. 80 billion in foreign currency to the Government of Sri Lanka to manage liquidity shortfalls during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also the Bank purchased Rs. 358 billion worth of Treasury Bills and Bonds from the primary auction in 2020, enabling the National Treasury and the Central Bank to maintain the rupee interest rates at the desired levels. As one of the largest contributors to the revenue of the exchequer, the bank also remitted Rs. 14.4 billion in taxes/dividends to the Government of Sri Lanka in the last financial year.  
“The year 2020 brought in unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19 pandemic, but People’ Bank was able to wade through them largely unscathed thanks to the commitment and the dedication of the bank’s senior management and each and every member of the staff. They all understood their national duty and were completely up for the task at hand. While being at the forefront of the government’s financial relief programme to support COVID-19 affected individuals and businesses by way of providing moratoria and low interest loans, we provided unhindered services to our customers keeping over 70% of our branches open even during the height of the lockdowns, and through our advanced digital platform,” People’s Bank Chairman Sujeewa Rajapakse said.
“At the get go, we realised that top and bottom lines wouldn't define the year 2020. A lot more was asked from us by the people, the Government and our customers, and I believe we were able to deliver that successfully to all our stakeholders. It was heartening to see People’s Bank’s efforts being publicly recognised by Dr. P.B. Jayasundera at the recently-concluded Colombo Development Symposium,” Rajapakse added.
Commenting on the bank’s performance in 2020 financial year and the challenges ahead, People’s Bank CEO/General Manager Ranjith Kodituwakku said: “Despite the extraordinary challenges we had to face, the key financial indicators of the bank remained in-tact during 2020, bearing testament to its robustness, prudent risk management, astute asset and liability management and most importantly the timely decisions taken by the management with nation’s best interest at heart.”
“However, the challenges are in no way over and the road ahead for banks this year could be choppier. But with its innate ability to overcome challenges, innovate and adapt will help People’s Bank to ride the post-pandemic era and emerge triumphant,” Kodituwakku added.
While satisfying the banking needs of its 14 million-customer base, and delivering its national duty diligently, People’s Bank continues to be at the receiving end of number of prestigious national awards and international accolades. 
People’s Bank was bestowed with the accolades of being recognized among the Top 1,000 Banks by the Banker Magazine, UK; The Best Digitised Bank in Sri Lanka 2020 at the Asia Money Best Bank Awards Sri Lanka; Best Consumer Digital Bank in Sri Lanka 2020 by World Finance Digital Banking Awards; Best Mobile Banking App by World Finance Digital Banking App and Best Digital Bank Awards in Sri Lanka by International Business Magazine Awards 2020.

People’s Bank, with a brand value of Rs. 44.75 billion, is also recognised as one of the country’s top three brands by world acclaimed Brand Finance in 2020.

Ceylinco Life representatives led by Director Devaan Cooray (centre) at the 2021 SLIM Peoples Awards ceremony
 


Continues reign as only life insurer to be voted ‘SLIM Peoples Life Insurance Service Provider of the Year’ every year since award’s inception


Sri Lankans have voted Ceylinco Life the ‘Peoples Life Insurance Service Provider of the Year’ for the 15th consecutive year, making the country’s life insurance leader the only company in its sector to win the coveted SLIM Peoples Award every year since the inception of the awards program.
This emphatic reaffirmation of popularity at the 2021 edition of these awards has only been outdone in longevity by Ceylinco Life’s performance, coming as it did a month after the Company’s financial results showed that it had retained market leadership in Sri Lanka’s life insurance industry for the 17th successive year.
Considered the hallmark awards event of the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), the SLIM Peoples Awards honours the country’s top brands across multiple sectors each year. The selection of winners is based on a nationwide quantitative face-to-face survey covering males and females between the ages of 15 to 60, over a period of five months using a structured questionnaire. Respondents are asked to mention their favourite brands and personalities across various categories, with those receiving the highest nominations being declared as the winners.
“Ceylinco Life has been helping Sri Lankans de-risk their future for more than three decades through the safety net of life insurance, as well as the many additional benefits the Company extends to its policyholders,” the Company’s General Manager – Marketing Samitha Hemachandra said. “The SLIM Peoples Award reflects the strong and enduring bonds Ceylinco Life has built not only with policyholders, but with the larger populace through its many engagements and community initiatives.”
The 2021 SLIM Peoples Awards presentation was the fifth year that the Peoples Insurance Service Provider of the Year was awarded separately to Life and General Insurance companies, following the segregation of these segments of insurance by law in 2015. In the 10 years that preceded the segregation, Ceylinco Insurance PLC comprising of Ceylinco Life and Ceylinco General Insurance, won the award every year.
Ceylinco Life ended 2020 with assets of Rs. 150 billion, total income of Rs. 36.9 billion, premium income of Rs. 22.1 billion, a Life Fund of Rs. 106.7 billion, an investment portfolio with a value in excess of Rs. 133.7 billion and pre-tax profit of Rs. 8.7 billion.
Sri Lanka’s leading life insurer for more than half of the 33 years it has been in existence, and certified as a ‘Great Workplace’ in Sri Lanka by Great Place to Work, Ceylinco Life was ranked the ‘Most Valuable Life Insurance Brand’ in Sri Lanka by Brand Finance in 2020, named the ‘Best Life Insurer in Sri Lanka’ for the seventh consecutive year by World Finance, also in 2020, and accorded an ‘Honourable Mention’ as one of the ‘Most Admired Companies in Sri Lanka’ in 2019-20 by the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL) in collaboration with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), UK.
Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies and is acknowledged as a benchmark in the local insurance sector for innovation, product research and development, customer service, professional development, sustainability and corporate social responsibility.

HNB Head of Trade and Financial Institutions Rozanne De Almeida 



Sri Lanka’s leading private sector bank, HNB PLC, continued to showcase its market leadership in international trade services after being declared as the ‘Best Service in Trade Finance’ for the third consecutive year by the Euromoney and Asiamoney Magazines and also as the ‘Market Leader (Asian Banks) – Sri Lanka’ for the third consecutive year by the Asiamoney Magazine.    
Rounding out the bank’s outstanding performance at this year’s awards, HNB was also declared ‘Market Leader in Trade Finance’ for 2019 and 2020 by Euromoney Magazine, demonstrating its unmatched superiority in consistent service excellence.  
“Especially at a time of historic uncertainty that we witnessed over the past two years, our team was able to deliver best-in-class trade finance services to clients, which in turn provided critical support to the national economy. Particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, these services became absolutely essential.   
“We therefore express our gratitude to the entire Trade Finance team for the remarkable commitment they have continuously displayed in successfully navigating this unprecedented complexity to drive value-creating partnerships,” HNB Managing Director and CEO Jonathan Alles stated.   
Euromoney Magazine is widely recognized by the world’s leading corporates, bankers, brokers, investors, regulators and policy makers as being among the most prestigious and globally influential financial publications, and serves as a leading authority on finance, banking, investment, and treasury.   
The Euromoney Trade Finance Survey recognises the leading providers of trade finance products and services on a global, regional and country level based on an annual survey of over 25,000 corporates, cash managers, treasurers and finance officers worldwide.  
The survey is designed to give participants valuable information on the global trade finance market and the opportunity to rank trade finance providers across a selection of categories and an overall global ranking of providers as rated by their clients.   
These awards are a testimony to HNB’s resilience and robust solutions to its valued clients which are complemented by a dedicated team of Relationship Managers, qualified trade practitioners and frontline staff who understands customer requirements.    
Certified as ISO 9001 2015, HNB Trade is a one-stop-shop trade services provider with a fully-fledged International Trade Services arm under the bank’s Wholesale Banking Group (WBG) vertical.   
HNB adopts a unique model to service its clients through a three-pronged approach where customer facing, centralised assessment of credit/compliance and centralised processing are seamlessly integrated to provide an unparalleled customer experience. The bank’s extensive island-wide brick and mortar branch network serves as the first point of contact for trade customers. These operations are supplemented by a multitude of alternate channels such as online trade, internet banking and secure communication providing both customer convenience and expeditious transaction processing.    
In order to provide the utmost in convenience to customers seeking to complete import or export documentation within the shortest possible time-frame, HNB’s Centralised International Trade Services Department is located at Janadhipathi Mawatha in close proximity to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the Import and Export Control Department, Sri Lanka Customs, Shipping and Logistics providers and other regulatory and statutory authorities.   
A key ingredient in HNB’s advanced capabilities is its team of highly experienced and qualified professionals that drive its International Trade Services department. HNB has the largest pool of Certified Documentary Credit Specialists among banks in Sri Lanka.  These highly skilled individuals combine innovative technology with unmatched technical expertise in order to provide simple, user-friendly solutions even for complex transactions, risk mitigation and trade finance, encapsulating the end-to-end process of a trade transaction, leading to greater confidence amongst the bank’s trade customers.    
The segregation of customers under Corporate Banking, Emerging Corporates, Small and Medium Enterprises and Retail Banking enables customised services to each of these segments according to their unique needs.    
“HNB offers some of the most advanced, streamlined and reliable Trade Finance services in Sri Lanka – from complete structuring of Trade Financing facilities, issuing of Letters of Credit and Negotiation of Export documents to issuing of Shipping Guarantees and the facilitation of Entrepôt trade business. While this is an extensive array, we always seek new ways to add value to our customers’ entire supply chain.  
Our uniqueness further extends to our ability to provide solutions through our deep insights to customer requirements. This is underpinned by our reputation among leading global banks who collaborate with us to provide tailored solutions to all stakeholders in the value chain. Our 900+ correspondent banking network that includes all top tier banks in the world gives us the dynamism to be a true partner in progress in all our customers’ international trade requirements,” HNB Deputy General Manager – Wholesale Banking Group Damith Pallewatte stated.  
 He noted that these capabilities have resulted in HNB being consistently selected as the preferred bank for guarantee re-issuances by foreign counterpart banks when their customers carry out projects in Sri Lanka.   
Similarly, Sri Lankan conglomerates who carry out overseas projects choose HNB as the preferred guarantee issuance bank, further reinforcing HNB’s position as the leading provider of Trade services of highest standard.  
Among the bank’s more recent milestone projects was Sri Lanka’s first Waste-to-Energy power plant which was recently commissioned at Kerawalapitiya for which HNB served as the lead bank of the syndicate arrangement.      With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the declaration of banking as an essential service, HNB immediately resumed services at all trade counters under stringent new health guidelines. As a result, the bank was able to ensure that clients were still able to clear consignments of essential cargo, pharmaceuticals and perishables.   
During this period the Bank also partnered with the Export Development Board and other external parties to conduct customer awareness programs by educating exporters on industry best practices, risk mitigation methods, and financial solutions.    
“We look to the future with a great deal of optimism as trade is poised to grow post the pandemic. The downgrading of the country’s sovereign rating has had many ramifications to the banking industry especially international trade transactions and its ripple effects are felt by almost all industries in Sri Lanka.  
 “However, HNB remains fully geared to capitalise on post pandemic opportunities through its transformative approach that focuses on four critical elements; people, technology, processes and data. The pandemic has fast tracked and forced technology adoption at all levels, and HNB having foreseen the importance of digitalization started investing in technology years ahead of competition. This is why we are able to thrive on digital channels,” HNB Head of Trade and Financial Institutions Rozanne De Almeida stated.   
Moving forward in its strategic expansions HNB will also be establishing dedicated ‘Trade Desks’ at selected strategic locations considering the need to support economic growth and opportunities post the pandemic. These strategic desks will be established to provide customer convenience, especially to those who are located at Special Economic Zones.

LOLC General Insurance recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with KIA Motors, the sole agent for Kia in Sri Lanka for vehicle repairs. 
The MOU was signed by LOLC General Insurance Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Kithsiri Gunawardana and KIA Motors (Lanka) Ltd. Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer Andrew Perera. Senior management officials of both organisations were present during the occasion.
As a result of this partnership, LOLC General Insurance customers who are owners of Kia motor vehicles are now able to enjoy a variety of benefits. For instance, the vehicle owner’s contribution will not apply for the vehicle body parts up to a period of ten years from the vehicle manufactured year. Furthermore, following the completion of the vehicle repair, the customer is able to collect the vehicle through a payment confirmation letter of LOLC General Insurance.
LOLC General Insurance, a fully-owned subsidiary of the LOLC Group recently became Sri Lanka’s first general insurance company to achieve Rs. 6 billion Gross Written Premium (GWP) in less than 10 years. The company reached the Rs. 6 billion mark in December 2020, becoming the fastest general insurance company to achieve this milestone in the industry.

As a part of DFCC Bank’s ongoing effort to enhance its digital service offerings via the bank’s dedicated website, the bank for everyone recently introduced a new income tax calculator tool. The debut of this tool complements the existing gamut of interactive services and tools made available to customers through their industry leading website.
This dynamic income tax calculator tool can be optimised according to the customer’s inputs. Values in LKR can be entered according to various forms of income which include employment, investment and business income. Additional fields such as other income and qualifying payments are also available for input, making the entire experience customer specific. 
The collapsible fields also allow for customers to segregate each form of income. As a bank that understands the uniqueness of each customer’s income, the collapsible fields enable inputs to be made in sub categories such as rent, dividends and consultation income among many other options. 
Customers are also given the preference to input the income as a monthly or annual figure. If the form of income is input as a monthly figure, the tool automatically converts the amount as an annual figure for the computation process. Any queries can be directly addressed via the tips options, which elaborates more on the process and how values should be input. 
Upon a successful calculation, the tabulated result can be printed or downloaded in a PDF format for the reference of the customer. 
Voicing his thoughts on the reason behind the addition of this tool, DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva had this to say, “The addition of this income tax calculator tool to our state-of-the-art website all comes down to customer convenience. In order to create a seamless digital experience for customers through our website, this tool is expected to be a method of value addition that complements our holistic digital approach, and leads us well on our way to becoming the most customer-centric and digitally enabled bank by the year 2025.”
The convenient tax calculator tool will be well received by many of the bank’s high income and affluent customers who earn above Rs. 250,000, thus falling into specific tax brackets. 
A significant proportion of these individuals tend to be DFCC Pinnacle, DFCC Prestige customers and Infinite and Signature cardholders together with existing and potential home loan customers with a loan value of over Rs. 5 million.

A strategic deal on Piramal Ceylon Glass Plc boosted turnover at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) but it failed to shine on investor sentiment as both indices dipped.
The All Share Price Index (ASPI) shed over 12 points or 0.18% and the S&PSL20 was down marginally by two points. Turnover was Rs. 7.44 billion.
First Capital said the CSE reverted the direction back to negative territory, posting a near two-month high turnover on the back of GLAS. 
“The index experienced a spike within the first few minutes of trading, reaching its intraday high of 7,155. Thereafter market witnessed a bumpy downtrend followed by a sideways movement within the final hour of trading and closed at 7,115, losing 13 points,” First Capital said. 
It said the Materials sector dominated the Rs. 7 billion plus turnover with a contribution of 89% aided by GLAS. Parcel trades in GLAS, HAYL and KHC boosted turnover for the session amounting to 84%. 
NDB Equities said the ASPI closed in red as a result of price losses in counters such as Browns Investments, Expolanka Holdings and Brown & Company.
Crossings were witnessed in Piramal Glass, accounting for 84.2% of the turnover.

Speaking during the event, Kumarathunga said: “In terms of digital payments and transactions, Sri Lanka is far behind many of its neighbouring countries and there is much more to do in order to develop the country’s payments and settlements system. Several committees have been appointed to steer these areas. I must state that the initiatives of iPay and LOLC Finance in digitalisation and automation is truly admirable and many other institutions can learn from this proven model.”
Dias said: “iPay is the number one payments platform now in terms of the number of transactions and customer acquisitions and iPay has been maintaining this position month on month continuously.

The Sampath Bank Head Office

 
Sampath Bank PLC joined hands with LankaClear to become one of the first banks in the country to facilitate real-time online payments to the Inland Revenue Department (IRD).
Sampath Bank customers will now be able to make payments to the Inland Revenue Department, 24x7x365, directly from their savings or current accounts using the Sampath Vishwa internet banking portal or the Sampath Vishwa app. 
Powered by LankaClear’s LankaPay Online Payment Platform, the payments will be credited to the Inland Revenue Department’s bank account almost instantaneously, unlike cheque deposits and customers will receive a digital proof of payment as soon as they complete the transaction. These payment receipts can be viewed on Sampath Vishwa and downloaded as and when needed.
Moving away from the traditional, cumbersome process of having to draw cheques, visit the IRD, and wait in queues, customers can make these payments confidentially from the safety and convenience of their homes and offices on their own, without having to step out during the current global pandemic.
This also eliminates the possibility of sensitive tax related information being accessed by others, thereby protecting the customer’s privacy.
“We are witnessing a steady rise in the adoption of digital payments across Sri Lanka, with individuals and businesses choosing to move more of their transactions online. As a bank that remains committed to leveraging the power of technology to deliver greater value to the nation, we are actively working with all stakeholders to drive this forward. In line with this, we are delighted to join hands with Lanka Clear and the Inland Revenue Department to simplify the process of paying taxes. We invite our customers to avail themselves of the convenience and security of making real-time online tax payments through their trusted online banking portal, Sampath Vishwa,” said Sampath Bank PLC Senior DGM – Operations/Group Chief Marketing Officer Tharaka Ranwala.
Furthermore, Sampath Bank is offering one of the highest payment limits amongst the partnering banks for these transactions and is actively working on enhancing these limits in the near future.
Sampath Bank’s efforts to take tax payments online together with LankaClear bodes well for the Inland Revenue Department and the Government too. It allows them to account for and access the taxes paid faster without waiting for cheques to realise. The move also makes the Inland Revenue Department more accessible to taxpayers around the island. Sampath Bank offers similar real-time, online payment services to the Sri Lanka Customs and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, enabling customers to make a wide range of payments to these institutes via Sampath Vishwa.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), the driving force of the country’s financial sector, has declared the year 2020 as the Year of Digital Transactions and often strives to come out with digital solutions for financial transactions in compliance with the international standards and incorporate new technology in to the same in a timely manner.  
National Savings Bank (NSB), which stands tall among the giants of the financial sector with 20.9 m accounts, an asset base surpassing Rs. 1 trillion and a deposit base exceeding Rs. 1 trillion, keeps new technology at the forefront and provides safe internet banking services as per global standards and guidelines of the Central Bank. Accordingly, its core banking system will go live in near future and a smart application will also be introduced. 
NSB has joined hands with the national program of promoting QR in urban as well as rural areas. The promotional programs held under this in several districts has clearly contributed to popularise QR among the people. The number of customers who get registered with the QR system and the number of transactions carried out through the QR System is on the increase daily.  Further, it is promising to note that the small and medium scale business persons who transact through current accounts are directing their income to their savings accounts through QR Codes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, using QR Codes became essential more than ever as a measure of minimising usage of notes and coins, where the virus can remain for hours. Therefore, persuading people to use QR can be identified as a corporate as well as a national responsibility.       
However, encouraging a people who have used physical money for a long time to get used to new technological aspects is challenging. Similarly, there are many difficulties when using physical money. Not having change is at the top of the list. As a solution to all such problems of using cash ‘Cash Wade’ (Hassle of Cash) program was implemented by the QR community and considering the positive responses received by NSB branches, the bank has taken the initiative in organising the Kandy District QR promotional program, ‘QR to Kandy’ (‘Nuwarata QR’), held recently in the city of Kandy, a world-famous tourist destination in the island. In parallel to this program, best customers of the bank in the Kandy region were felicitated.
While the new inventions of the financial sector and new technological applications are popular among urban and young segments of the society, further assistance and guidance of the Ministry of Finance and CBSL is required to popularise them among rural segments as well. As per the Department of Census and Statistics, Sri Lanka has been able to achieve an economic growth of 1.5% during the third quarter of 2020 in comparison to the previous year. 
Central Bank Governor Prof. W.D. Lakshman has projected that the economic growth of the country will increase from 5% to 6% during the year 2021 and accordingly, NSB strictly believes that all of us should ensure our maximum contribution to revitalise the agricultural and service production process during 2021 and the development of QR as the national digital payment solution would support this course immensely.

Standing from left: Seylan Bank Manager - Digital Commerce Manoj Wijewardane, Seylan Bank Head of Digital Banking Channels Chaminda Senewiratne, Mintpay Chief Executive Officer/Co-Founder Urmila Chandrasekeram and Mintpay Chief Technology Officer/Co-Founder Kukaraj Tharmasegaram

 
The beginning of a revolutionary partnership was marked on 1 March between Seylan Bank and Mintpay, a platform that is the first to offer customers the option to buy now, pay later for any product or service offered by merchants powered by Mintpay’s AI-driven payment platform. 
While the market is used to instalment based payments through many financial service providers, where they’re expected to go to the merchant location and ask that their transaction be converted to an instalment based plan or call their financial service provider to request for the transaction to be converted to an instalment plan. Mintypay is a bank agnostic and will eventually also be a merchant agnostic payment platform that will manage this process automatically. 
This partnership opens up a host of opportunities for online shoppers in Sri Lanka through the proprietary technology developed by Algoredge Ltd., providing both merchants and consumers across the island with a novel online shopping experience. 
Customers will be able to use the Mintpay payment platform with any of their merchant partners to split their shopping cost into three interest-free payments over a payback period of two months. The solution typically allows the customer to check out at any online shop that is registered with Mintpay (https://mintpay.lk/) and use their credentials to log in and make the payment which automatically converts their payment to an instalment plan. 
Sharing his thoughts on the partnership, Mintpay Chief Technology Officer Kukaraj Tharmasegaram said: “The start-up was inspired by the thought of hundreds of eager customers not being able to purchase goods due to the unavailability of credit at a time of need, hence not being able to use their debit cards. There are far more debit cards in the market when compared to credit cards and typically a debit card is linked into a bank account which may, or may not have the funds required for purchase at any given time. Thereby Mintpay enables a customer to pay for a certain transaction in instalments rather than having to pay the full amount at once. Apart from the above, the machine learning and data analysis based approach enables the Mintpay operational platform together with the decisioning engine to make predictive judgements to ensure that all stakeholders are secured. The platform will also provide customers with information about their purchases for future online purchases.”
The registration process to Mintpay is easy and hassle-free. One could consider this service as a cash advance service for the customer while enabling the merchants to receive the entire purchase value at the time of purchase itself. These attributes will minimise payment collection issues and avoid having to wait for three months to collect funds for already purchased 
products.  
An initial test-launch was coordinated in September 2020, the Mintpay team has been able to confirm the viability of their service and iterate further to develop an end-to-end seamless user experience. This will help minimise transactional losses, assist in maintaining competitive pricing while providing merchants with plenty of data that can be used as the foundation for future strategic growth.  
An essential step forward for the e-commerce platform was made possible through this partnership. Merchants are quickly realising the value of increased conversion rates that come with providing customers with a buy now, pay later payment method.
“The solution is revolutionary; as it’s the first homegrown payment platform of this nature that has been launched in Sri Lanka. Seylan Bank has always placed itself in the forefront of embracing innovative customer-centric solutions that are profoundly needed in the rapidly evolving financial ecosystem in Sri Lanka,” said Seylan Bank Head of Digital Banking Chami Senewiratne. This foresight and vision will enable all customers and merchants to enjoy the flexibility and convenience that is brought to the table by the Mintpay technology and powered by Seylan Bank.

London (Reuters): Aviva has sold its Polish operations to Germany’s Allianz for 2.5 billion euros ($ 2.94 billion) in cash, completing a program to sell European and Asian assets begun last year, the British insurer said on Friday.
Allianz trumped rival bids from Italy’s Generali and Dutch insurer NN, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. 
Aviva’s boss Amanda Blanc has been selling assets at pace to focus on the life and general insurer’s core businesses of Britain, Canada and Ireland. Aviva also has joint ventures in China and India.
“The sale of our Polish business is an excellent conclusion to the refocusing of our portfolio announced just eight months ago,” Blanc said, adding that the sale of the eight businesses would generate 7.5 billion pounds ($ 10.31 billion) in cash.
Allianz is also buying Santander’s minority stake in the Aviva Poland business, bringing the total value of the transaction to 2.7 billion euros, Aviva said in a statement.
Santander will retain a 49% holding in the business’s life and general insurance joint ventures, Aviva added.
Allianz, which first entered the Polish market in 1997, ranks as Europe’s biggest insurer and while it has no plans to grow its life insurance operations, it sees the deal as a springboard to further expand across lucrative central and eastern European markets, sources told Reuters.

Sri Lanka tends to rank low in terms of insurance penetration compared to the rest of the region, with insurance premium amounting to little over 1% (2019) of the country’s GDP whereas the average in other countries in the region is around 3% to 4%. 
One of the main reasons behind this is the low GDP per capita in the country (below $ 4,000) which essentially means that not many Sri Lankans carry the required disposable income to protect themselves and cannot afford a level of insurance protection that they should have. Another very significant reason for the low level of penetration stems from the cost for insurance companies to reach the masses, where the premiums generated cannot sustain the selling costs of the traditional sales channels and thus a significant proportion of the population remains underserved in terms of being able to fulfil their insurance needs. 
In such a scenario, one should appreciate the efforts taken by reputed corporates representing two well-regulated industries who have come together to offer affordable insurance products to the masses and to the less-privileged at grassroots levels in our country. Through these insurance schemes, thousands of customers have benefited immensely at the time of bereavements, injuries or hospitalisations. If not for these products made available at a very low cost, these customers would have never obtained an insurance cover and would have never benefitted from the compensation they have received. 
The role of mobile insurance
In this context, mobile insurance, has enabled financial inclusion for over a decade, giving people access to affordable, transparent insurance solutions and necessary tools to better manage their financial lives. Undoubtedly, mobile has succeeded in introducing millions of people to insurance and widening their access to a diverse range of insurance products. The popularity of these solutions can be attributed to the convenience and ease of using mobile to enrol and pay for insurance, and make claims and receive claim payments. It is estimated that over two million customers have been served through mobile insurance which is nearly 10% of the country’s population. It is also estimated that nearly Rs. 1 billion has been paid in claims and if not for the mobile insurance platform these customers would never have had the opportunity of accessing these products and benefiting from the compensation paid. 
With over 30 million mobile connections by 2020, versus a population of 21 million, there is a significant market opportunity for Sri Lanka to leverage mobile to leapfrog traditional models by helping to protect the under-insured and offer a range of affordable insurance products be it from the Life or General insurance segments. The traditional distribution segments of individual advisors, brokers etc cannot access this market in a meaningful manner whilst also ensuring that premiums are very small and affordable. 
Taking the lead in Sri Lanka 
Today, we are seeing that local insurers are realising the importance of mobile insurance and the impact it could bring for millions of low-income earners in the country. A number of 
insurers have understood this significant gap and have established themselves on such a platform.
Technology has enabled simplicity and cost-effectiveness of on-boarding customers onto the platform. These customers would otherwise not have been able to access insurance solutions that were previously only distributed traditionally. Mobile insurance has disrupted the industry by eliminating a huge portion of the operational costs involved in the traditional insurance process and passing that cost-benefit directly to the customer. 
When the whole world is moving towards technology-based transactions and services, this is an ideal platform through which to introduce insurance products to the masses. Promoting insurance through digitalised schemes is encouraged even in well-developed markets and is fast becoming popular in developing countries and emerging markets, when the Government of Sri Lanka is driving the country towards high tech and digitalised products and services, this could be considered an extremely successful and a smoothly run model operation for such projects. The vision of the President is to take development to the rural communities through various programs such as ‘Gama Samaga Pilisandara’ to uplift the lives of rural communities. Hence, all encouragement should be given to such schemes that offer benefits to these clients rather than hampering such efforts. 
The Insurance Regulatory Authority of Sri Lanka (IRCSL) has adopted a very progressive outlook and supported the industry to innovate and push the boundaries of the traditional business models by providing an enabling environment for the industry. This is much appreciated. The industry has responded positively to this and we urge the authorities to continue to take further progressive steps in order to achieve a higher level of insurance penetration in Sri Lanka. 
In conclusion
The growth of mobile communication-enabled insurance in recent years among developing countries injects a vital booster to Sri Lanka’s insurance industry. Furthermore, it seriously addresses barriers such as affordability, convenience and accessibility that people have when purchasing an insurance policy. The upsurge of mobile penetration lays a robust platform for the local industry to enable the lower-income segment to afford a wide range on insurance products. 
The insurance industry has always been a very dependable and solid protector of the nation at all times of national crises stepping up to play its expected role when needed. The industry has done its utmost to build trust and confidence amongst the population by providing invaluable resources over the decades. As an industry that prides itself in being professionally managed, it will change and adapt to achieve higher standards. 
The Insurance Association of Sri Lanka, as the official body representing all insurance companies, is of the view that an enabling environment must be created that is progressive that facilitates innovation of products and delivery channels with the end objective of serving the insurance needs of the entire nation and not only of those who can afford it through which the 
level of insurance penetration can be increased above the present 1% levels to regional levels of around 3% to 4%.

LONDON (Reuters): Global dividend payments could rebound by as much as 5% this year, a new report estimated, after the coronavirus caused the biggest slump in payouts since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
Companies’ payouts to shareholders plunged more than 10% on an underlying basis in 2020 as one in five cut their dividends and one in eight cancelled them altogether.
A total of $220 billion worth of cuts were made between April and December, based on investment manager Janus Henderson’s Global Dividend Index. But there are signs companies are beginning to reinstate at least some of them.
Janus Henderson’s report warned that dividends could still fall 2% this year, in a worst-case scenario. But its best-case scenario sees 2021 dividends up 5% on a headline basis.
“It is quite likely we will see companies pay special dividends in 2021, utilising strong cash positions to make up some of the decline in distributions in 2020”.
Banking dividends will be likely to drive the rebound in payouts in 2021, the report said, after the European Central Bank and Bank of England eased blanket bans for lenders on dividends and buybacks. These were imposed during the first wave of the crisis to prepare for a potential increase in bad loans.
UK lenders Barclays and NatWest resumed payouts this month.
Last year, dividend bans meant banks cut or cancelled $70 billion of payments globally, according to the report. But the overall global dividend cuts proved less dramatic than expected. In August, Janus Henderson had expected the virus to drive corporates to cut $400 billion worth of dividends, nearly double the eventual outcome.
A resilient fourth quarter of 2020 helped, said Janus Henderson. The likes of German car maker Volkswagen and Russia’s largest lender Sberbank restored payments.
Mining and oil companies cut dividends after a slump in commodity prices, while consumer discretionary companies also took a hit following lockdowns.
European dividends, not including Britain, fell by 28.4% on an underlying basis in 2020 to $171.6 billion. “This was the lowest total from Europe since at least 2009,” Janus Henderson said.
In contrast, North American payouts rose 2.6% for the full year, setting a new record of $549 billion, the report said. Canada had the fewest dividend cuts anywhere in the world, the index showed.

Colombo Stock Exchange  







CSE Head of Origination and Issuer Relations Purasisi Jinadasa 




Colombo Stock Exchange Head of Origination and Issuer Relations Purasisi Jinadasa in an interview with the Daily FT makes a strong case on why companies must seriously consider
listing. He also dismisses various misconceptions and concerns about listing and stresses that the process isn’t difficult or complex. Here are excerpts:
Q: Please explain how the CSE can assist businesses to raise capital?
The Colombo Stock Exchange can be an excellent platform for companies both in the private sector and the state sector to raise debt and equity capital. The stock market is a powerful tool that should be leveraged by companies and seriously considered as an alternative to the traditional methods of raising capital.
At the CSE, we have three boards on which companies can list given its funding needs and stage of growth. The Empower Board is for nascent businesses seeking to grow, while the Diri Savi and the Main Board are generally for mid to larger established companies. The rules and regulations applicable to each of the boards takes into account the needs of the issuers and ensures adequate protection for investors. 
Listing on the exchange permits access to global capital and further facilitates attracting the right capital given a company’s stage of growth and future vision. 
 
Q: The interest rates at present are low; hence why would you recommend companies to come and raise capital for their next phase of growth?
 Bank interest rates are low for both borrowers and savers. This actually provides a prime opportunity for companies to list as the valuations that they may be able to solicit will be more attractive. Investors (aka savers) are hungry for higher yields and they will not find those savings rates at our banks or via new debt instruments. Therefore, they will be willing to pay a higher price for IPOs of companies with strong growth stories and/or visions. 
Further, the Government has encouraged long-term investing by providing a tax deduction of Rs. 100,000 per month for investments made in the stock market. This will further fuel the growth of stocks becoming a common component of a savings portfolio – which is actually an important aspect of a diversified retirement savings plan, however not widely used in Sri Lanka. In other words, more demand for quality listings. 
Related to this question is one misconception regarding listing on the exchange – that it is expensive. This is not the case. In fact, if you compare interest and capital repayment costs to listing costs you will invariably find that listing is much more cost effective. 
 
Q: You mean to say that costs associated with listing are not high. Can you comment on the cost comparison of raising capital through a listing?
 If you are assessing the direct monetary costs associated with listing, you will find that listing is much more cost-effective. There is no burden of interest or capital repayment. Your future shareholders will invest in your company in exchange for capital appreciation (in the form of share price) and/or dividends.
Depending on the Board on which the you choose to list, the costs can be as little as Rs. 10 million over a 10-year period. 
 
Q: Is the listing process difficult?
 The listing process is not difficult. There is a clear framework available to understand which Board your company qualifies to list on and depending on the Board, there are clear requirements that the company has to meet. The process will also necessitate either the use of an investment bank of your choice or a sponsor (Empower Board only). Your choice in terms of investment bank should be based on their prior track record in successfully listing companies and raising capital. But it also should include consideration on whether they understand how best to structure your company’s story in order to attract the right investors. The investment bank you choose will ensure that the process moves smoothly on your behalf. 
As mentioned earlier, the O&IR at the stock exchange is available as your first stop on your journey to raise capital via the exchange.
 
Q: Many organisations fear the disclosures required as it will have tax implications in the future. Can you please explain how this can be handled?
 The benefit of listing prior to the end of 2021 is that the Government is according a 50% reduction in tax for the immediate financial year and a further three years at a reduced rate of 14%. This should address many concerns regarding the transition.
Further, discussions with company auditors and tax experts will ensure that organisations are able to take advantage of any additional tax benefits available. Entities may also evaluate possible structures that benefit from further tax concessions depending on the business. 
 
Q: Is there a limitation on the amount that an organisation could raise via an IPO?
 The Initial Public Offering (IPO) valuation will take into account the current state of the company as well as future cashflows that will be generated through the execution of the business strategy. The process will permit full price discovery through public appetite for a company’s shares based on the story that the owners and management stand by. Therefore, the limitation will be the overall value of the company determined by this process. However, it is important to note that depending on the strength of a company’s vision, organisations can continue to access the public market via subsequent raises. This may have a dilutive effect on the share price, however if the rationale for additional funds is sound, investors will continue to support the company.
 
Q: There is always a perception of loss of control, particularly for family-owned businesses. Is this a real concern?  
 This is another common misconception. Depending on the Board a company chooses, there is a minimum public shareholding requirement. However, the highest would be applicable to the Main Board and is only 20% if the market capitalisation is less than Rs. 2.5 billion. If it is higher, then the required public holding percentage falls. Therefore, the family and/or owners continue to retain 80% even at the highest requirement, which translates to effective control of the company. Nobody can legally force a majority shareholder to sell-down and so a family can continue to execute its vision post-listing. 
There are also other mechanisms to ensure that the owners have control of the company even if their percentage holding is low. In fact, many of the largest listed entities globally continue to have the Founder’s descendants as controlling shareholders, although they hold a small percentage of the total outstanding shares.
 
Q: SMEs contribute more than 50% of the GDP. How has the CSE come forward to aid SME growth?
 Small and Medium Enterprises are the backbone of economies globally and at the CSE we launched a new Board – The Empower Board – in order to cater to the growth needs of this segment. The Empower Board is a platform for smaller and nascent companies to access global capital and enables them to lower their reliance on restrictive bank lending terms. We encourage SMEs to contact us and explore the opportunities that listing will provide them.
 
Q: There is a perception that listed companies are over-regulated. Is this true?
 This tends to be another common misconception. The regulatory requirements for listed entities are only slightly incremental and by no means prohibitive in nature. Primary requirements, depending on the Board the entity chooses to list, will look at governance structures and filings related to annual reporting. The majority of the requirements are already a part of normal business activity at an unlisted entity. 
 
Q: You mentioned the tax relief provided in relation to activity at the stock market. Do you expect these benefits to be sustainable?
 Both the concessions provided for new IPOs and those provided to Investors (as mentioned earlier) are strong steps to strengthen stakeholder participation. The Sri Lanka stock market in terms of Investor participation and Issuer participation is still nascent and therefore such policies will drive both types of participants to learn about how best to leverage the market. As participation increases and Investors and Issuers start benefiting due to stronger uptake as a result of these policies, you will find them to be sustainable and effective methods to grow the overall capital market. 
 
Q: You mentioned a few misconceptions regarding going for an IPO. Can you highlight them a little more in detail?
 Apart from those I spoke about:
Governance and regulation, is another area that seems to deter individuals from listing. However, governance regulations on listed entities are only incremental to those of unlisted and as indicated earlier, governance requirements also differ given the Board in which you choose to list. 
Loss of company intellectual property tends to be another concern. However, the required disclosures will never require to part with IP. A good example is the exact recipe used for Coca-Cola – a global giant in carbonated drinks. 
 
Q: How does a company commence the process of listing?
 In order to ensure potential Issuers get the opportunity to better understand how best they can leverage the stock market, one could contact the Origination and Issuer Relations unit. The O&IR provides potential Issuers a starting point to familiarise themselves with the listing process as well as the advantages of leveraging the exchange for funding needs. The unit will be available to Issuers at all points through to the submission of the listing application as a sounding board. 
Further, following the IPO, the CSE will continue to provide support to newly-listed entities to better facilitate the transition to a publicly quoted entity.

Suite of trade finance products and services will help clients meet ESG-related sustainability objectives

 
Standard Chartered is launching sustainable trade finance solutions across Asia, Africa and the Middle East, Europe and the Americas. The bank’s new Sustainable Trade Finance Proposition is designed to help companies implement more sustainable practices across their ecosystems and build more resilient supply chains. 
The Sustainable Trade Finance Proposition builds the Loan Market Association’s Green and Sustainability-linked Loan Principles into Standard Chartered’s trade financing framework, encouraging clients to improve disclosure, reporting and definition of use, while meeting their environmental, social and governance goals. The initial focus will be on supply chain finance, invoice financing, receivables services, bonds and guarantees and letters of credit, and the product set will be expanded in due course. These products will help global supply chain activities – estimated at $ 19 trillion by the World Trade Organisation – become more sustainable.
The new Sustainable Trade Finance Proposition allows the bank to support the following:
1. Sustainable goods: Working with customers and partners to finance underlying goods that meet agreed sustainability standards.
2. Sustainable suppliers: Supporting trade for suppliers who meet acceptable thresholds against ESG ratings or metrics such as gender equality, responsible sourcing criteria and water use.
3. Sustainable end-use: Focusing on trade financing in sustainable industries including renewable energy, energy efficiency, the blue economy, sustainable infrastructure, water management and clean transportation.
4. Transition industries: Helping industries transition and reduce their carbon footprint by offering trade financing that recognises efforts to help reduce emissions.
Simon Cooper, CEO, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking and CEO of Europe and the Americas, said: “Trade finance has an enormous opportunity to help make global supply chain activities more sustainable by offering companies the products and solutions they need to achieve their sustainability agendas. Our new Sustainable Trade Finance Proposition will help companies build more resilient supply chains, as we work to make global trade more sustainable and inclusive.” 
Some examples of the bank’s sustainable trade finance solutions that have driven positive impact include:

A sustainability-linked supply chain finance solution for an international sportswear manufacturer, linked to its ESG/Sustainability performance to incentivise more sustainable practices across the supply chain.
An import invoice finance facility for an electric vehicle manufacturer.
Bonds/guarantees and trade finance solutions for renewable energy companies.
Enabling the import of personal protective equipment via import invoice financing under its COVID-19 $ 1 billion financing commitment, launched in March 2020. The bank also offers trade finance at cost to companies that meet the criteria for that program.

Fresh on the heels of being recognised as The Bank of the Year Sri Lanka, by The Banker Magazine UK


National Development Bank PLC was crowned as Sri Lanka’s Best Bank 2021 by the prestigious Global Finance Magazine of USA, in its 28th edition of awards for the World’s Best Banks. This much-coveted win by NDB closely follows the Bank being recognised as The Bank of the Year Sri Lanka 2020 in December 2020, by renowned The Banker Magazine of UK’s annual Bank of the Year Awards – dubbed as the Oscars in the banking and financial services industry. 
Accordingly, NDB becomes the incumbent holder of both these defining awards simultaneously, given away by two of the most seminal publications in the world, a feat rarely achieved by a bank. This achievement affirms the significant impact and contribution NDB is making to the Sri Lankan banking sector, as the fourth largest listed banking entity in the country, 40 years young with agility and nimbleness whilst embracing novelty to stay continually relevant in the rapidly evolving industry landscape. 
With this win from Global Finance, NDB joins an elite group of best banks from their respective countries across the globe, such as DBS of Singapore, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Bank of America of USA. Being recognised as the Best Bank in Sri Lanka attests to NDB’s excellence in financial performance and equally important – its support to key stakeholders and the community in the unprecedented challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Expressing his views on this exceptional achievement, NDB Director/Group Chief Executive Officer Dimantha Seneviratne stated that NDB and its team is encouraged to be recognised by this awards program, which garners much respect as one of the most independent and objective evaluations in the industry. He stated that this is a clear reflection of the equilibrium in performance that the Bank has maintained through the toughest of times, without any aspect being compromised on. “I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to all our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders, and also the passionate and dedicated NDB Team, for taking the NDB brand to the global arena and for making great achievements a possibility,” he further stated. 
In a statement made by Joseph D. Giarraputo, publisher and editorial director of Global Finance he said, “Banks are playing a key role in economic recovery around the world. Our Best Bank awards highlight the leaders in restoring growth and mapping a way forward. This year’s evaluations are more important and valuable than at any point in their 28-year history, given the unprecedented economic conditions wrought by the global pandemic.” 
In further elaborating the mechanism that led to the meticulous selection process, a Global Finance Press Release stated that the winners of this year’s awards are those banks that attended carefully to their customers’ needs in difficult markets and accomplished strong results while laying the foundations for future success. All selections were made by the editors of Global Finance after extensive consultations with corporate financial executives, bankers and banking consultants, and analysts throughout the world. In selecting these top banks, Global Finance considered factors that ranged from the quantitative objective to the informed subjective. Objective criteria considered included: growth in assets, profitability, geographic reach, strategic relationships, new business development and innovation in products. Subjective criteria included the opinions of equity analysts, credit rating analysts, banking consultants and others involved in the industry, the Press Release further stated. 
Notwithstanding the challenges of the pandemic, the NDB group posted strong financial performance for year 2020, whilst delivering essential support to its wide customer base in helping them revive and thrive in the new normality. NDB emerged as the fourth largest lender under the Saubhagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility – aimed to provide vital support in working capital requirements of businesses affected by the pandemic, affirming NDB’s commitment to ensure customer wellbeing at all times. 
NDB ‘Jayagamu Sri Lanka’ dedicated to empowering exporters, inventors and SMEs, ‘Sri Lanka Vanithabhimana’ aimed to recognise trailblazing women of Sri Lanka, “Let’s Grow” reforestation project as a part of the Bank’s corporate sustainability endeavours are some clear examples of NDB’s resolution and power to perform. NDB has also made progressive strides in the digital banking sphere, in bringing convenience-defining digitised banking solutions to its customers and efficiency-enhancing processes in its internal operations. The Bank’s agility and aspirations augmented by precise execution have propelled it to become one of the most digi-savvy banking institutions in the country. 
With a Rights Issue and plans to onboard a European based development financing institution – Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries (Norfund) which will result in a minimum equity capital infusion of Rs. 8 billion announced, NDB is set to achieve greater results, whilst delivering added value to various stakeholders, as Sri Lanka’s premium banking and capital market services group. NDB’s performance excellence across multiple aspects have been recognised by over 60 local and international awards, making NDB one of the most decorated brands in the country.

Reuters: Property and casualty insurer Chubb Ltd. on Thursday offered to acquire smaller rival Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. in a $ 23.24 billion cash-and-stock deal.
Chubb’s $ 65 per share offer represents a premium of 13.2% to Hartford’s last close of $ 57.41.
Hartford earlier in the day said it received a takeover bid from Chubb, but did not disclose the financial details of the offer.
Chubb in its recent statement said it has not yet received a response from Hartford to its proposal, adding that even if a deal is agreed upon, its terms, structure or timing cannot be assured.
A deal between The Hartford and Chubb would be the biggest in the sector since Aon Plc’s $ 30 billion acquisition of Willis Towers Watson last year, and the largest in the U.S. P&C insurance space since Chubb was created in its current form in January 2016.
Then, ACE Ltd. bought Chubb Corp for $ 28.5 billion, with the combined company retaining Chubb’s branding.
In a note, Wells Fargo analysts called The Hartford’s small-business insurance franchise the main draw for Chubb, which currently focuses on covering mid-sized and large companies. Chubb has around $ 9.4 billion of excess capital to fund any transaction.
They noted that previous deals in the P&C space valued companies at upwards of 1.8-times book value, likely seen as a baseline for negotiation by The Hartford, which traded at 1.14-times prior to Thursday’s news. A 1.75-times valuation would price The Hartford at $ 30 billion.
The coronavirus pandemic is reshaping the insurance industry, and consolidation could help cut costs after substantial losses in 2020.
Chubb Chief Executive Officer Evan Greenberg warned in April last year that the pandemic would likely spur the single-largest loss in the industry’s history. The insurer booked $ 1.19 billion in pandemic-related losses in 2020.
P&C insurers also faced significant catastrophe losses in 2020 from wildfires in western states and the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record. Combined with claims associated with civil unrest, these outweighed benefits from fewer auto claims as people drove less because of the pandemic, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Thursday.
Chubb, which reported $ 41 billion of gross written premiums last year, also provides personal accident and supplemental health insurance, as well as life insurance, in 54 countries and territories.
Founded in 1810, The Hartford reported $ 17.3 billion in total premiums last year. The company provides coverage for workers’ compensation, management and professional liability, and other specialised areas, including political risk.
The Hartford famously sold baseball slugger Babe Ruth an insurance policy in 1920 for disability protection and also insured the only home Abraham Lincoln ever owned.
Chubb traces its roots to 1882 when Thomas Caldecot Chubb and his son Percy opened their marine underwriting business in New York City.

The global shift towards a cashless society created a huge space for mobile wallets as a safer and more convenient way of managing money. As the COVID-19 continues driving a digital transformation of payments, the entire segment witnessed impressive growth in the last year, both in the number of users and transaction value.
According to data presented by Finaria.it, mobile wallets are set to become a $ 2.4 trillion worth industry this year, growing by a massive 24% year-on-year. The strong rising trend is forecast to continue in the following years, with the unified market reaching $ 3.5 trillion value by 2023.

Transaction value doubled amid COVID-19 outbreak
Mobile wallets wiped out the need for carrying money while reducing the chances of theft or losing currency. They allow payments by passing a smartphone app over a merchant’s payment terminal. Data transfers are made via wireless standard Near Field Communication (NFC) or by scanning a Quick Response (QR) code to trigger an online bank transfer. ApplePay, Google Wallet, WeChat Pay, and AliPay lead this market.
In 2018, the global mobile wallets market was worth $ 755.6 billion, revealed the Statista survey. In the next 12 months, the value surged by 90% to almost $ 1.2 trillion.
In 2020, the mobile POS payments market hit a $ 2 trillion benchmark, driven by a surge in digital payments amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Statistics indicate transaction value is expected to jump by half a billion in 2021, showing a 107% growth in two years. By 2023, mobile POS payments are forecast to grow by another 40%, and by 2025, the unified market is set to reach $ 4.6 trillion value.
The average transaction value per user in the mobile point of sale payments segment amounts to $ 1,670 in 2021, representing a 25% increase compared to the 2019 value. This amount is expected to jump by 22% in the next two years and reach $ 2,051.
The number of people choosing mobile wallets to manage their payments also witnessed a huge increase in recent years. In 2019, 901 million people globally had been using this method of making payments.
According to a Statista survey, the number of users is expected to jump to almost 1.5 billion in 2021, growing by 11% year-on-year. By 2023, the total number of people using mobile wallets is expected to jump to 1.7 billion worldwide.

China to generate half of all mobile payments by 2023, US market to grow by 49%
Generally, the mobile wallets market is dominated by Asian countries, spearheaded by China as the global leader. Market conditions in China played a huge role in mobile wallets becoming so popular. The infrastructure for mobile payments was already in place. Moreover, credit cards never gained the popularity they have elsewhere in the world.
According to the Statista survey, the Chinese market’s transaction value is forecast to reach $ 1.3 trillion in 2021. By 2023, the country is expected to generate more than 50% of all mobile wallet payments.
Western countries are far behind in terms of usage, with most people still preferring cash, credit, and debit cards. The US ranks as the world’s second-largest mobile payments market, with $ 465.1 billion worth of transactions or nearly three times less compared to China. However, statistics show the US market is set to witness impressive growth in the following years, with transaction value growing by 49% to almost $ 698 billion in 2023.
The UK is the third-largest mobile wallets industry, expected to reach $ 98.5 billion transaction value in 2021, a 195% jump in two years. By 2023, mobile POS payments in the UK are expected to grow by another 60% and hit a $ 157.8 billion value.

Weekly T-Bills auction remains undersubscribed
Money market liquidity decreases


 By Wealth Trust Securities

Activity in the secondary bond market remained rather moderate during the week ending 19 March with no significant momentum generated. The yields on the maturities of 15.12.22, 15.12.23 and 2027’s (i.e. 15.08.27 and 15.10.27) were seen increasing to weekly highs of 5.85%, 6.30% and 7.50% each respectively against its previous weeks closing levels of 5.75/80, 6.23/33, 7.35/45 and 7.45/55 on limited activity while yields were seen fluctuating within the range of 6.14% to 6.20%, 6.18% to 6.28%, 6.45% to 6.50%, 6.55% to 6.64%, 6.66% to 6.70% on the maturities of 15.07.23, 01.09.23, 15.03.24, 15.09.24 and 01.12.24 respectively.
In addition, maturities of 15.03.23, 15.11.23, 01.01.24, other 2024’s (i.e. 15.06.24 and 01.08.24), 15.01.26 and 01.05.29 were seen changing hands within a tight range of 6.05% to 6.07%, 6.22% to 6.25%, 6.35% to 6.40%, 6.50% to 6.56%, 7.05% and 8.20% to 8.25% respectively as well.
The sluggish sentiment was due to the outcome of the weekly Treasury bill auction where the weighted average rates were seen edging up for a seventh consecutive week with only an amount of Rs. 25.82 billion been accepted in total against its total offered amount of Rs. 45 billion. In addition, the drop in money market liquidity, where the total outstanding market liquidity was recorded at Rs. 119.17 billion in comparison to its previous week of Rs. 181.37 billion contributed to the sentiment.
The foreign holding in rupee bonds decreased marginally to Rs. 6.43 billion for the week ending 17 March while the daily secondary market Treasury bond/bill transacted volumes for the first four trading days of the week averaged Rs. 10.00 billion.

The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in association with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) recently engaged the family business community in Sri Lanka through the inaugural Issuer Forum for 2021 hosted on the theme ‘Founder to Family – Leveraging Going Public’, at the Shangri-La Hotel Colombo. 
The event was organised to highlight how a family business can take advantage of going public while ensuring the family retains control and continues to guide the vision of the business and to address the misconceptions regarding listing which deter businesses from exploring an initial public offering. 
Globally, companies access public markets for varying reasons including, diversification of funding options in order to lower bank credit exposure, funding for growth, attracting strategic investors who believe in the company growth story, strengthening management and corporate governance structures and to ensure survivability post-founding generation. 
SEC Chairman Viraj Dayaratne PC shared his perspectives and stated, “One of our objectives is to increase liquidity of the market. There are many misconceptions in the market. One is that listing process is cumbersome, that it takes time and also that it can be very expensive. But it is not cumbersome or expensive as many would perceive. It is one of the best options to raise capital. And that is why we want businesses to come to the capital market and make use of the opportunities. Government has created a healthy environment. The last budget proposal has given many tax incentives which are open until the end of the year. So, it is the best time to come and list your company.”
CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando noted, “It’s an interesting juncture in our equity markets and in our capital markets with an environment that has become much more conducive to more companies accessing capital markets. We thought now is the right time to start speaking to companies, especially family-owned businesses about the types of benefits, the types of processes and the types of multigenerational value that you could get from being listed on the stock exchange. With family businesses, one of the most important things that listing can do for you is strengthening your governance and creating a legacy where your company can withstand various issues that might come as a private company.”
The Forum drew an encouraging response from the family business community and was attended by over 70 representatives of prominent family businesses in Sri Lanka. The content discussed at the event included sessions on how best to structure an IPO, the preparatory process for a Family business prior to an IPO and Wealth Management for Family Businesses, as well as Regulatory benefits and tax advantages post IPO, which will help in balancing the Family’s needs as well as those of future stakeholders. 
CAL Managing Director, Global Markets and Investment Banking Deshan Pushparajah added his insight on taking family businesses public stating, “When you think of it as a family business, it is important to take a view from a strategic perspective which is right for the family. In that perspective, the critical thing to think about is the longevity of the business. Only 3 to 4% of family businesses make it beyond the third generation. So, when you approach a listing what should be considered is that what is right to ensure the continuation of the business. One of the biggest objections to listing is losing control. In essence control is being able to direct the future of the company and that could be achieved in many different forms such as having a private trust, multiple classes of shares, brand ownership and other options.”
Lynear Wealth Managing Director Dr. Naveen Gunawardane shared his insight on creating a governance structure for family matters prior to an IPO and aspects of family wealth management. He mentioned when managing wealth, “We see a lot of people make the mistake of taking a piece meal approach. So, the key thing to think about here is that you need to institutionalise a process in which you actually make your investments and manage your wealth. Ultimately a business needs to place a governance structure in place. And with such a structure your investment portfolio starts to diversify with time, which in parallel provides you with better risk management. Ninety percent of family wealth is lost by the third generation and an IPO is a fantastic way for you to ensure longevity of your family business.”

Partner Jithendran Gajendran spoke to a few misconceptions associated with listing including the perception of increased regulation, financial disclosures, loss of control and the perception of high costs adding, “Listing is viewed as expensive [with costs associated with] tax consultants, brokers, PR agencies and auditors. But the truth is, it is not like that, when you go through the process you realise you save money – might be tax, cost optimisation or for other reasons. Listing also helps you in transitioning from generation to generation by professionalising the business in a speed that will allow you to get the benefits.”
The program also featured an interactive panel segment where SEC Commissioner Manil Jayesinghe, Director General Chinthaka Mendis, CSE Chief Regulatory Officer Renuke Wijayawardhane and Head of Origination and Issuer Relations Purasisi Jinadasa joined the discussion. They covered key considerations for family businesses that are interested in going public and addressed the questions raised by members of the audience.
Jayesinghe shared the SEC perspective on how the Commission enables efficiency and protection as opposed to the myths surrounding the rules created to ensure safety of the parties involved in the capital market. He elaborated on how the capital market benefits business owners as it provides credibility and a debt free capital acquisition to grow.
Mendis commented on how SEC stands to facilitate listing while ensuring confidence for the issuers and investors to approach the market, market operator and the market mechanics and thereby unleash the full potential of the wealth of all the parties. Offering insight on the CSE view Wijayawardhane discussed how CSE has liberalised the listing framework, listing boards and listing options in consideration of the changing market dynamics. He further highlighted how CSE over a period has been quite flexible and amenable to the market dynamics by explaining diverse approaches they have initiated in order to improve the regulatory framework. 
The CSE as part of its Issuer Relations activities will continue to directly reach out to companies regarding providing clarity on the listing process, the associated benefits and why a listing is an ideal opportunity to consider given the current business context. Companies interested in engaging CSE to find out more information regarding listing are invited to contact Purasisi at purasisi@cse.lk or on + 94 112356402.

London (Reuters): Britain proposed weakening the market grip of ‘Big Four’ auditors on Thursday and making company directors responsible for spotting fraud after the collapses of retailer BHS and builder Carillion.
Directors would have to repay their bonuses if the company went bust or serious failings come to light.
The long-awaited proposals, put out to a four-month public consultation, implement the bulk of recommendations made in three government-backed reports on audit market competition, regulation and corporate governance.
‘It’s clear from large-scale collapses like Thomas Cook, Carillion and BHS that Britain’s audit regime needs to be modernised with a package of sensible, proportionate reforms,’ Britain’s business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said in a statement.
Some of the proposals are already being introduced in voluntary form, such as operational separation of audit and the more lucrative consultancy work at PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY, who known collectively as the ‘Big Four’ and dominate auditing of blue chips.
The Financial Reporting Council, criticised by lawmakers for being too timid in regulating auditors, is already undergoing an internal transformation to become the more powerful Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority or ARGA, proposed on Thursday.
The government proposed that a smaller audit firms undertake a meaningful portion of a big company audit, stopping short of the joint audit initially recommended by the UK Competition and Markets Authority. This would help ‘challengers’ build up expertise to fully take on the Big Four later on.
If this competition strategy fails, the Big Four face caps on market share, the government said.
New reporting obligations would be introduced on both auditors and directors around detecting and preventing fraud. Company boards would require to set out what controls they have in place in a British version of the stringent US Sarbanes-Oxley anti-fraud safeguards introduced after energy giant Enron collapsed.
Accounting experts say such increased responsibilities would mean individuals taking on fewer directorships. After the consultation ends, the government said it would propose legislation when ‘parliamentary time allows’.

Cover of Softlogic Life’s 2020 Annual Report 







Softlogic Life Chief Financial Officer Nuwan Pushpakumara




The 2020 Annual Report of Sri Lanka’s fastest-growing life insurer, Softlogic Life, recently became the first entity in Asia and Sri Lanka to obtain external assurance on integrated reporting practices. This
reflects Softlogic Life’s commitment to transparent and objective reporting towards shareholders and other key stakeholders. 
Obtaining assurance over integrated reports is an emerging trend, with Softlogic Life receiving what is referred to as external assurance for its 2020 report. 
After the Board of Softlogic Life sought assurance on the financial statement information and integrated reporting, KPMG reviewed the report to assess whether it had been prepared in line with the guiding principles of the International  Framework and to ensure it covered the key content elements. The auditor confirmed that the most significant data, statements and assertions within the report regarding the IIRC’s activities had been extracted appropriately from underlying documentation and appropriate external sources.
Prepared under the theme ‘One Lankan,’ it’s an ode to the million Sri Lankans who have entrusted Softlogic Life with their protection and care for a million reasons. The company’s dynamic portfolio of products and services is designed to safeguard and empower these people, while its agility to evolve has helped Softlogic Life align its trajectory to contribute to the nation’s growth ambitions. 
The 2020 Integrated Annual Report provides a comprehensive but concise account of how Softlogic Life has created value for its stakeholders in 2020 and its 21st year of operations. The report has closely followed guiding principles and fundamental concepts in the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) Framework to serve the information needs of stakeholders best. 
Commenting on the decision to obtain external assurance on the 2020 Annual Report, Softlogic Life Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed said: “As a leading life insurance entity in Sri Lanka, we have long recognised the role assurance can play in building trust and confidence in integrated reports and this trend has been reflected by developments we see globally. We are extremely proud to obtain this as Asia’s first insurance company, which is a huge milestone for the entire industry. We also believe the lessons we learnt in obtaining assurance will help us in our conversations with businesses around the world that are also embarking on the journey to provide investor-grade information in their integrated reports.”
Furthermore, Softlogic Life has presented the video version of its integrated annual report for the fourth consecutive year. Unveiled in 2017 as Sri Lanka’s first video Annual Report, Softlogic Life’s innovative approach aims to enhance user-friendliness and simplicity, encouraging key stakeholders of the company to familiarise themselves with their comprehensive content integrated annual report.
Available now on YouTube and Softlogic Life’s official website, the video showcases several key details of this year’s Annual Report using unique infographics —financial outcome which include gross written premium (GWP) achieved, profit before tax (PBT) and Year-on-Year (YoY) growth, business operating context to the business process of the company, intellectual capital to human capital, innovations and new products unveiled by Softlogic Life in 2020 and risks to opportunities. The new medium of information allows the company to communicate their data with policyholders, employees, investors and other external stakeholders in a visually fitting and digital way.
Commenting about the success of this initiative, Softlogic Life Chief Financial Officer Nuwan Pushpakumara said: “The positive feedback we have been receiving since 2017 from our stakeholders for the video Annual Report confirms the success of this landmark innovation. We are humbled to present a well-crafted video version for the fourth consecutive year, which translates how well the overall business strategies have elevated Softlogic Life during a tough year to become the third-largest entity in the life insurance industry with sustainable growth.”
Softlogic Life recently announced that despite all the difficulties associated with a thoroughly disrupted COVID year 2020, the company grew revenues to record Gross Written Premium (GWP) of Rs. 15.6 billion, an increase of 25%, making it the fastest company to that mark. One in every three policies taken up in 2020 was a Softlogic Life policy with the company insuring over one million Sri Lankan lives. Softlogic Life was also ranked third largest in the life insurance market, rising one more notch during the year and has overtaken much older players to establish strong growth momentum with market share increasing to 15.2%.
The 2019 Annual Report received many awards and accolades, including three awards at the 24th SAFA best presented Annual Reports Awards organised by the South Asian Federation of Accountants hosted by CA Sri Lanka. Softlogic Life has been ranked as the seventh most transparent listed company on the Colombo Stock Exchange as well as the most transparent insurance company in Sri Lanka by Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) in its latest report titled ‘Transparency in Corporate Reporting (TRAC): Assessing the Top 50 Listed Companies in Sri Lanka’. Softlogic Life has scored a TRAC score of 7.9, making it the only insurance company in Sri Lanka to be included in the top 10 list.

The significant global volatility driven by COVID-19 has led to a spike in affluent entrepreneurs and international investors building diversified domicile portfolios through residence- and citizenship-by-investment in a bid to overcome the limitations and risks of being restricted to a single residence. In the past eight months, Henley & Partners has seen a 32% increase in the daily average number of enquiries compared to the first six months of 2020. 
The shifts in the predominant nationalities of entrepreneurs who are interested in investment migration are eye opening – with the most astonishing being a 192% leap in enquiries from US citizens in 2020 compared to the previous year. 
Nowhere close to that, but no less remarkable, there was a 34% increase in enquiries from Canadians, a 30% rise in enquiries from Australians, and 29% and 26% more enquiries from UK and French nationals, respectively. 
Ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UNHWI) and their families from some of the world’s most advanced economies are opting for an integrated investment migration portfolio of complementary citizenship and residence options, both to create optimal value and mitigate risk in terms of where they can live, work, and invest. 
Henley & Partners CEO Dr. Juerg Steffen says that while a single alternative residence or citizenship will always be an asset, investing in a suite of different domiciles worldwide will hedge against manifold levels of volatility, creating an enhanced combination of value and yield.
“It’s a case of not putting all your eggs in one basket. The majority of options include the whole family, and many extend to parents and others even to grandparents. The more jurisdictions you and your family can access, the more diversified your assets and opportunities, and the lower your exposure to country-specific risk and global volatility.”
“For decades, it has been accepted best practice to invest in different regions and different asset classes, from equities to real estate, to spread the risk and find the greatest value. But what about where you reside? The same principle applies. 
“In an increasingly unpredictable world, you need to diversify your geographical domicile options to guarantee and enhance long-term success by securing access to top quality education and healthcare, for example. You also need to reduce your exposure to risks such as higher crime, increased tax rates, political instability, social turmoil, poor governance, or unexpected policy changes. 
“Entrepreneurs and investors recognise that having a diversified portfolio of residences and/or citizenships can add impetus to their wider wealth planning and legacy management strategies to protect against further downside and to create new value and enhance wellbeing for the entire family,” Dr. Steffen said.
The mounting interest in securing multiple options for domicile is a worldwide phenomenon. 
Henley & Partners Group Head of Private Clients Dominic Volek says the desire for UNHW families to secure global access and have a range of choices has skyrocketed. “This isn’t just about vital risk management and hedging potential volatility. This is about taking a truly global perspective, and the best way to do that is to have a diversified portfolio of domiciles – a range of locations where you, your family and extended family, and your assets can be based. 
“HNW and UHNW investors from emerging and developed economies alike are seeking out alternative business, career, educational, and lifestyle opportunities on a worldwide scale, broadening their option base and transcending the constraints imposed on them by their countries of origin to improve the resilience of their portfolios and ensure physical and financial longevity and legacy.” 
“Our clients are realising the compounded and multi-generational benefits of acquiring several citizenships and/or residences to expand the future potential for their global families,” says Volek, who goes on to provide some examples. 
“An Indian UHNW entrepreneur residing in Dubai, with family businesses in Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East and real estate in Europe, where they wish to acquire residence, at the same time would like their children to be able to live and study in the UK in a few years’ time, so while applying for the UK Investor Immigration Program they also apply for the Portugal Golden Residence Permit Program because after five years as a legal resident of Portugal, where the physical presence requirement is limited, they and their children can be eligible to apply for Portuguese citizenship, which would then provide them with settlement freedom throughout the EU.” 
In terms of options for extended families, Volek says: “We are seeing more UHNW investors wanting to include their siblings, parents, and grandparents in their investment migration applications. There are many options that cater for large, multi-generational families, and the beauty is that family members don’t necessarily have to be in the same location. 
“For example, a successful tech entrepreneur could apply for Australia’s Global Talent Independent Visa, or any of Australia’s residence-by-investment options for that matter, to obtain permanent residence there. His children, meanwhile, have their sights set on studying in Europe, so they also apply for the Greece Golden Visa Program, which has no residence requirement. 
“And since December 2020, minors may apply for a Greek Golden Visa as a main applicant through purchasing real estate or opening a time deposit bank account in Greece, so they might consider that option for their children. 
“The retired parents, on the other hand, would prefer to live in Thailand, so they also apply for the Thailand Elite Residence Program, which has an option that includes dependents, which may include legitimate parents, stepparents, a spouse (including by civil union), children, and stepchildren.” 
Volek goes on to say that the Thailand Elite Residence Program is a top choice for supplementing any investment migration program. “Thailand is a safe, prosperous country with an excellent quality of life and there is no minimum stay requirement,” he says.
Volek mentions that certain investors apply for more than one option because they have immediate requirements, which can be met by a certain program, but looking ahead they have a different program in mind.
As Dr. Steffen points out: “Before COVID-19, affluent investors chose where to reside based on somewhat predictable factors such as quality of life, access to education, and travel freedom. Now the big draw cards include safety and security, access to first-class healthcare with strong capacity, reliable infrastructure, pandemic preparedness and management, good airlinks, and most importantly – better prospects for their children and grandchildren and a safe and comfortable retirement for their parents and grandparents. 
“Building a varied investment migration portfolio can hedge against ongoing risk and uncertainty and facilitate both wealth portfolio and holistic lifestyle diversification that creates significant new value and positive optionality. Developing a strong investment migration portfolio takes careful planning and it takes time. You don’t want to wait until it’s too late. You want to take a strategic approach, not a mad dash to the fire exit when things go wrong in your current place of residence.”

I am a firm believer in the market economy but one with desirable and effective regulation. While the market economy I speak of provides abundant freedom to think, create, conceptualise, invent, innovate and execute, it is also not one which enables the freedom of the wild entrepreneur or market participant, who abuses the consumer, the investor, the market or rules or regulations.

Background
The market economy and regulation, the open economy and privatisation are themes under which I have written extensively, made presentations on, participated in interactive sessions in public and private fora, moderated discussions, and endeavoured to share thoughts in print media, in my column ‘The Thought Leadership Forum’ launched in 2005 and incorporated with the Registrar of Companies, in 2008.

Beyond enabling statutes
Having served as a regulator on the Accounting and Auditing Standards Monitoring Board; as one of the three members of the first Consumer Affairs Council the apex body of the Consumer Affairs Authority; as a Commissioner of the SEC for several years, in an ex officio capacity as well as, as the subject Minister’s appointee, concluding with my appointment to the office of Chairman SEC Sri Lanka, there is a guiding philosophy I adopt. That is that regulation must be aware, up to date, relevant and fair, just and equitable and of course timely.

Under reaction, overreaction, delayed intervention
Under reaction, delayed intervention, as well as overreaction followed by withdrawal of circulars takes away from the respect and credibility, essential for effective regulation.
It is against the background described in the preceding paragraphs, that I find the March 2021 case where the SEC – USA announced fraud charges and an asset freeze and other emergency relief against an Irvine, California-based trader who used social media to spread false information, noteworthy.

Learning from the lessons of the US-SEC
During my brief 18-month term of office as Chairman, I had the opportunity to attend a two-week session at the headquarters of the SEC USA in Washington DC, where representatives of almost all members of IOSCO (the apex organisation of securities commissions worldwide) were present. 
We had healthy insight into the variety of approaches adopted by the US and many other jurisdictions. I must say I felt reassured that we were a reasonably good regulator but could well progress further if we had an open mind, and were passionate and committed to capital market development, side by side with regulation.

Investor education and advocacy
While enjoying the beautiful cherry blossoms in full bloom, during my short walk between the high security, imposing SEC headquarters building and the Hilton Hotel, each morning and evening, many creative initiatives developed in my mind, for implementation when I got back home. One among them, was what the US terms ‘Investor Education and Advocacy’.
Might I add in lighter vein that I was unable to return home in time for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, and with last year’s COVID-19 induced New Year, and thus two consecutive incomplete New Years, I hope April 2021 will usher in a much better time for us.

External relations
Immediately on my return, I proposed that we rename the External Relations Division, headed by Director Tushara Jayaratne, as the SECSL’s ‘Office of Investor Education and Advocacy,’ on lines similar to the US SEC. Tushara and his Manager Sheena Gooneratne were eager to improve their divisions responsiveness and we performed a comparative analysis of several similar units, in multiple jurisdictions, the title given to the divisions, its terms of reference, etc.

Capital market education and training
Another division, the Capital Market Education and Training Division, was to be merged with the External Relations Division, given also that managers and assistant directors in the latter – experienced, good, seasoned men and women, were not necessarily ‘up to their necks’ with work as it were.

Organisational restructuring and repositioning
The idea of restructuring two divisions and repositioning them as one division to combine investor education, advocacy, training and capacity building within capital market participants, was to achieve what I termed

A necessary, wholesome, enjoyable, educational task
A strategy to minimise and mitigate risks of less than aware, less than experienced (for example retail, short-term) investors who today, will invest, inter alia, based on a variety of less than credible sources including social media which may be through innocent “forwards” as well as schemes with the intention, to defraud and mislead.


Guidance bulletins
An ‘investor education and advocacy bulletin’ of the US SEC as recently as January 2021 states that “Retail investors may seek to profit from volatile markets by buying individual stock, including stock in heavily-promoted companies with smaller market capitalisations. Some of these stocks may be discussed in social media, news aggregators, investment research websites, online investment newsletters, ratings websites, message boards, chat rooms, and discussion forums. It can be tempting to jump on the bandwagon and follow whatever the crowd seems to be doing. Sometimes, however, following the crowd may lead to significant investment losses.” 

Short-term and margin trading, options et al
The bulletin further states that “Short-term trading, including trading aided by the use of margin or options, can lead to significant and unanticipated losses for retail investors.” It says “Investors should keep in mind these behaviours when considering investing in a volatile market including:

 Investing in bubbles or manias – Financial ‘manias’ or a ‘bubble’ is the rapid rise in the price of an investment, reflecting a high degree of collective enthusiasm or exuberance regarding the investment’s prospects. This rapid rise is usually followed by a contraction in the investment’s price. The contraction, or ‘panic’ occurs when there is wide-scale selling of the investment that causes a sharp decline in the investment’s price.
Momentum investing – Another investing strategy that can pose high risks for retail investors is ‘momentum investing’. An investor using a momentum investing strategy seeks to capitalise on the continuance of existing trends in the market. A momentum investor believes that large increases in the price of an investment will be followed by additional gains and vice versa for declining values. If that belief turns out to be incorrect, it can lead to significant losses.
Noise trading. A third related strategy is ‘noise trading’. Noise trading occurs when an investor makes a decision to buy or sell an investment without the use of fundamental data (that is, economic, financial, and other qualitative or quantitative data that can affect the value of the investment). Noise traders generally have poor timing, follow trends, and overreact to good and bad news in the market.”


Short sales, volatility, pumps and dumps
“Guidance is given on margin trading, options, short sales, rules designed to address market volatility in stocks with ‘Limit up-Limit Down’ caution regarding fraudsters using online platforms to spread false or misleading information to manipulate a company’s stock price, pump and dump schemes, the need to consider time horizons for investing, etc.”
Within the context of all of the above, I thought the following media release of the SEC USA, dated 15 March is of immediate practical relevance to us in Sri Lanka. For the benefit of all market participants, the SEC SL and the CSE, I thought I will reproduce it, in its entirety:
SEC charges California trader with posting false stock tweets
(Washington D.C., 15 March 2021)
“The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges and an asset freeze and other emergency relief against an Irvine, California-based trader who used social media to spread false information about a defunct company, while secretly profiting by selling his own holdings of the company’s stock.
“According to the SEC’s complaint, which was filed under seal in federal court in the Central District of California on March 2, 2021 and unsealed today, Andrew L. Fassari used the Twitter handle @OCMillionaire to tweet false statements about Arcis Resources Corporation (ARCS), a defunct Nevada company with publicly traded securities, during December 2020. Specifically, the complaint alleges that, on Dec. 9, 2020, Fassari began purchasing over 41 million shares of ARCS stock shortly before tweeting false information about ARCS to his thousands of Twitter followers, including falsely claiming that ARCS was reviving its operations, expanding its business, and being backed by “huge” investors.
“The complaint further alleges that, between Dec. 9 and 21, 2020, Fassari made approximately 120 tweets that referenced “$ARCS,” dozens of which were false and misleading. For example, he tweeted, “$ARCS 380,000 indoor cultivation 1 Million+ sq ft processing. WEEEEEEEEE This CEO has big plans for us” and “a ton of news coming and backed by huge investors for its #cannabis operation[.]” In seeking an injunction, the SEC alleges that Fassari continued to tweet about other stocks as recently as January and February 2021.
“The complaint further alleges that, over the next several days, ARCS’s share price skyrocketed, ultimately increasing over 4,000%. The complaint also alleges that Fassari made false statements about his own trading in ARCS. Between Dec. 10 and 16, 2020, Fassari allegedly sold all his shares in ARCS for profits of over $929,000, all while continuing to publish false and misleading information about ARCS and his trading in ARCS.
“We allege that Fassari profited by using social media to deceive investors,” said Melissa R. Hodgman, Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “The SEC is committed to protecting investors by proactively monitoring suspicious trading activity tied to social media, and by charging those who use social media to violate the federal securities laws.
“The SEC’s complaint charges Fassari with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty from Fassari. In addition, on March 2, 2021, the SEC issued an order temporarily suspending trading in the securities of ARCS.
“The SEC’s investigation, which is ongoing, is being conducted by John Dwyer, Leslie Hughes, Jeb Wildschut, and Kerry Matticks, with the assistance of Stephen Glascoe and Jessica Regan in the Office of Investigative and Market Analytics, and is supervised by Danielle R. Voorhees, Jason J. Burt, and Kurt L. Gottschall. The SEC’s litigation will be led by Ms. Hughes, under the supervision of Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.”

Motivational speaker Udaya Devamulla addressing the audience at Ceylinco Life’s inaugural ‘Viyaparika Athwala’ program 

Ceylinco Life has announced the launch an entrepreneur development program titled ‘Viyaparika Athwala,’ which will be conducted islandwide to support the aspirations of Sri Lankan business people, in the backdrop of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Loosely translating to ‘A hand to business’ the program will consist of a monthly seminar focusing on motivational as well as behavioural aspects that can help entrepreneurs better manage their businesses as well as their work-life balance, the company said.
The first workshop under this initiative was held recently in Kandy with the participation of a group of entrepreneurs in the area, in accordance with the COVID-19 health and safety guidelines stipulated by the Ministry of Health and the Government. At the helm of the event was motivational speaker Udaya Devamulla who addressed the audience on goal setting and overcoming obstacles.
Ceylinco Life has planned 12 such programs for the year ahead, all of which will include addresses by key resource personnel on topics such as goal setting, handling obstacles and overcoming problems, living a healthy and active life, health tips, and best practices in health screening.   
Commenting on the launch of this program, Ceylinco Life Managing Director Thushara Ranasinghe said: “Besides promoting a positive and well-balanced approach to business, we hope the programme will also encourage entrepreneurs to pursue their ambitions with confidence. As the country’s leading life insurer, we know through our interactions with hundreds of thousands of people that fear of risk can limit a person’s ability to pursue goals, and by extension, the capacity to earn. We will elaborate on how de-risking one’s ambitions can unleash potential that has been held in check.”
‘Viyaparika Athwala’ will also provide a platform to create awareness among busy and ambitious entrepreneurs on how life insurance can help them to work towards and achieve goals and dreams, by providing the peace of mind needed to work towards personal and career goals.

Commercial Bank Chairman Justice K. Sripavan flanked by the Bank’s Managing Director S. Renganathan (left) and Chief Operating Officer Sanath Manatunge, declares open the Bank’s new Jaffna branch building in the presence of members of the corporate and senior management 
 

History was revisited once again when the Commercial Bank of Ceylon returned to the original location of its Jaffna branch recently, resuming operations at an address where banking had taken place since the late 1930s.
Completely rebuilt and designed and equipped for eco-friendly operations, the new Jaffna branch building at 474, Hospital Road, Jaffna, represents a major enhancement in services.
The original building at this location came in to Commercial Bank’s possession in 1973 when the Bank acquired three branches of the Mercantile Bank of India (MBI), and had been patronised by several generations of customers. The branch has been in operation since 1973 without any interruption to its operations. Commercial Bank operates 12 branches within the Jaffna peninsula and a total of 18 branches in the Northern region. 
Following its ceremonial reopening on 15 March, the new five-storey Jaffna branch of Commercial Bank has an Automated Banking Centre (ABC) with five Cash Recycler Machines (CRMs), an eSlip cheque collection facility and a Cheque Deposit Machine (CDM) that together offer access to cash and deposit facilities around the clock, 365 days of the year.  The building will be fitted with rooftop solar panels that will generate a major percentage of the electricity required; a rainwater harvesting facility and its own sewage treatment plant that will recycle sewage into water to irrigate the gardens; and is designed to maximise use of natural light during daytime, further reducing energy consumption. It is also equipped with energy-efficient air-conditioning, and the accessories in the bathrooms are all water-efficient, enhancing the building’s ‘Green’ credentials. Additionally, the Bank said many green and re-usable materials were used in the construction process.
The new building was ceremoniously declared open by Commercial Bank Chairman Justice K. Sripavan accompanied by the Bank’s Managing Director S. Renganathan, Chief Operating Officer Sanath Manatunge and members of the corporate management.
Commercial Bank also recently relocated its Trincomalee branch to a purpose-built eco-friendly building on land owned by the Bank.
The first Sri Lankan bank to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World and the only Sri Lankan bank to be so listed for 10 years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 268 branches and 887 ATMs in Sri Lanka. The Bank’s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets; Myanmar, where it has a Microfinance company in Nay Pyi Taw; and the Maldives, where the Bank has a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake.

Secondary bond market activity remains low


By Wealth Trust Securities

The weekly Treasury bill auction was seen continuing its upward trend in weighted average rates for a seventh consecutive week at its auction held yesterday, as only an amount of Rs. 25.82 billion was accepted in total against its total offered amount of Rs. 45 billion.

However, demand for the 364-day bill remained low as only an amount of Rs. 657 million was accepted against its offered amount of Rs. 25 billion. 
The weighted average rates increased by two and one basis point each on the 91-day, 182-day and 364-day maturities, reflecting an accumulated increase of 31, 29 and nine basis points respectively over the past seven weeks. The bids-to-offer ratio stood at 1.46:1. 
Trading activity in the secondary bond market remained low yesterday with only maturities of 15.12.22, 15.03.23, 01.01.24 and 01.05.29 changing hands at levels of 5.85%, 6.05% to 6.07% and 6.35% to 6.38% respectively.

Chinthaka, Access Natural Water Assistant Accountant Vijaiy Muthiyah and Access Natural Water Senior Accounts Executive H.A.S. Shirasha  

Sri Lanka’s leading private sector bank HNB PLC’s pioneering digital payments app HNB SOLO recently signed up Access Natural Water Ltd. with the brand name Aquafresh as an official vendor, enabling customers to make their payments digitally in a seamless transition supported by LANKAQR.  
Under this tie-up, Aquafresh customers will be able to conveniently make all of their payments by scanning the QR codes now available on the monthly invoice, with the HNB SOLO app.  
Commenting on the partnership, HNB Head of Marketing Chammika Weerasinghe said: “We are truly committed to driving this digital payments transition to encourage the whole of Sri Lanka to adopt QR codes as the new payment solution. This partnership with Aquafresh, the trend setter in the bottled water industry, is a monumental milestone in this revolutionary initiative which has offered HNB SOLO the opportunity to pioneer the new normal of financial transactions with an ever-expanding vendor base.”  
The partnership is in line with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL) ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ initiative promoting LANKAQR as the standard for mobile phone and digital payments across the island, moving towards a cashless and digitally-savvy society with greater financial inclusion.  
“We are excited to be a HNB SOLO vendor, working with the bank to facilitate a seamless contactless and cashless payment option across our extensive customer base. We believe that revolutionising consumer and transactional experiences is an important step towards innovation and modernisation in Sri Lanka. As such we are happy to be a part of this journey of transformation with HNB who has onboarded over 4,000 vendors to its extensive portfolio,” remarked Access Natural Water Ltd. Director/COO Shanil Perera said. 
As LANKAQR is a common Quick Response (QR) code standard developed by the CBSL, vendors will no longer need multiple QR codes for different platforms. Users can make payments via LANKAQR by scanning the code using SOLO. Upon completion, vendors will receive an instant SMS notification, confirming the receipt of payment.  
Having already linked LANKAQR to SOLO, HNB was among leading financial institutions and telecommunication partners driving a cashless QR-code based payments revolution that aims to make mobile phone payment apps and digital payments the standard for day-to-day transactions island-wide. 
The bank has continuously bolstered the features and functionality of its digital payment app HNB SOLO while refining its user interface to make QR-based payments intuitive, easy to use and versatile. SOLO also offers attractive promotions and rewards to its growing user base. Additionally, the app can digitally store all payment instruments, including VISA, MASTER debit and credit cards, and any bank account connected to the JustPay payment ecosystem. 
LANKAQR enables banks, financial institutions and telcos to facilitate fast, secure and low-cost digital payments to any merchant or service provider through their digital payment apps and platforms. LANKAQR provides customers with a payment mechanism for all their needs ranging from groceries, healthcare to utilities, and even the purchase of goods from street-side vendors, directly from their bank account through the use of any LANKAQR-compliant mobile payment app.  
Established in 2001, Aquafresh is the leader in Sri Lanka’s bottled water industry, and is the flagship brand under Access Natural Water Ltd., an associate company of the Access Group. The brand has proven its leading position by always delivering pure and safe drinking water, and has also been able to capture the international market with its high-quality products. With 252 customer centres across the country, HNB is one of Sri Lanka’s largest, most technologically innovative banks having won local and global recognition for its efforts to drive forward a new paradigm in digital banking. Over the recent past, the bank was ranked among the World Top 1,000 Banks list compiled by the prestigious UK-based Banker Magazine. HNB has a national rating of AA- (lka) by Fitch Ratings (Lanka) Ltd.  
HNB was also declared Best Sub-Custodian Bank in Sri Lanka at the Global Finance Awards 2020. The bank further won the Award for the Best Retail Bank in Sri Lanka for the 11th time at the Asian Banker Awards 2020, in recognition of its sustainable growth and continuous improvements in processes, products and services amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment.

It’s not all doom and gloom if the Central Bank and the Treasury play with a straight bat

By A Banker

The Central Bank last week extended the moratorium on leasing payments for businesses and individuals engaged in passenger transportation sector.
First and foremost, how long can the leasing companies survive like this by delaying the impairment provisioning or writing off these debts as a blanket moratorium without a proper financial evaluation as to how these companies can be revived being undertaken?
The lack of such evaluation in a market environment which is very challenging and very little private sector investment despite the low interest environment will only result in a massive hit to the NBFIs which they cannot absorb and will send many of them into bankruptcy. 
What happens when a NBFI goes bankrupt is that poor depositors (as most of the money lent out to these high-risk ventures by the NBFIs are depositors’ monies), which includes pensioners, widows and those who have invested their hard earned retirement monies stand to lose everything just to keep a few companies afloat for a short while? Is this fair without a lifeline from the Central Bank available directly to the tourism sector if they wish to support exclusively this sector?
As everyone knows most institutions and individuals who borrow from NBFIs are those who have been rejected by the banking sector for various reasons including the fact that they are unbankable. Now this be can be interpreted in any which way one wants. 
While I accept that at a time like this all of us, not just the leasing companies, must support those in financial difficulty we must be pragmatic and conduct a thorough evaluation as to whether they have the capability of surviving a crisis like this.
In this regard it is now timely that the regulator must create the climate for mergers and acquisitions for the financial sector in particular by granting concessions to increase individual shareholder ownership in the entire finance sector which will bring in shareholders with deep pockets to invest in these companies without having the limits on ownership as now. This is a dire need right now and must be done without further delay.
This will also bring in new investors not just locally but also internationally. As we all know there is a lot of local money outside and foreign investors outside who are looking to invest in emerging markets, which have always given good returns on their investments and these are today bypassing Sri Lanka. One has the right to ask, why oh why are they not coming here to this Paradise isle of ours?
1) Lack of consistency in policies. Be it exchange control, tax, employment, education, etc. Did you know that it is almost impossible to bring in foreign expertise to work in Sri Lanka and the approval process is arduous? If one takes education examples are many. 
2) We have laws aplenty but do they work? Are they implemented and enforced fairly? How about the law delays? We know it takes near seven to 10 years to enforce a simple mortgage action after being postponed an umpteen number of times in the courts?
3) Remove the limits to ownership of financial institutions. It is not helping in improving the quality of the shareholders or long-term stability of the financial sector. This is a major barrier to entry of quality investors while money launderers are entering through the backdoor. 
4) Make the investment climate conducive to attract FDIs. Learn from regional examples which are many. Thailand, Indonesia even Malaysia are excellent examples. 
5) The approval processes are littered with red tape and bureaucracy and delays. The one-stop-shop system is not working; we all know that and we are just fooling ourselves. 
I can write pages on why all is not well in this beautiful island of ours but it’s not all doom and gloom and I still see light at the end of the tunnel if we can work honestly to get some of the things I have highlighted above straightened out.
For this we do need the Central Bank and the Treasury, to use cricketing parlance, ‘to play with a straight bat’.

K Seeds Investments has identified LOLC Finance PLC as the best performing finance company under the 1st category among the 30 listed finance companies in Sri Lanka through a ranking carried out based on their financial performance for the third quarter of 2020/21.
The report segregates the finance companies based on the size of their asset base, and ranks them in their respective categories among their peers based on ten financial metrics, which are calculated from the published quarterly financial statements. LOLC Finance Company PLC topped the overall spectrum by belonging to ‘Category 1’ (asset base > Rs. 100 billion). The Categories 2, 3 and 4 represent the companies having an asset base between Rs. 50-100 billion, 20-50 billion and less than 20 billion respectively.
The moratorium by the CBSL and the low interest rate environment has made a major impact on the overall performance of the finance companies. However, LOLC Finance PLC has made significant improvement in their performance and has reached the top of the ranking from being in the 4th position during the previous quarter. The report ranks the finance companies according to their financial results released through interim reports on the Colombo Stock Exchange across 10 key performance indicators (KPIs) – cost/income ratio, return on equity, return on assets, net profit margin, net interest margin, impairment to loan book, credit to deposits, operating leverage, net profit growth and loan growth. These 10 KPIs are weighted equally, and an overall ranking is arrived at based on the aggregate score for each category.
K Seeds Investments is a boutique investment bank in Sri Lanka, specialising in mergers and acquisitions, balance sheet structuring, equity/debt placements, treasury management, corporate restructuring and talent management.

HNB Managing Director and CEO Jonathan Alles completing a transaction via HNB SOLO at Harshi Lace from its proprietor Bimalka Chandima with HNB Galle Customer Centre Senior Manager Eranga Abeywickrama and HNB Executive – SOLO Activations and Promotions Reeza Jaleel look on

Further supporting a cashless payment ecosystem, Sri Lanka’s most future-ready bank, HNB PLC, supported the LANKAQR initiative of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) with the onboarding of over 1,500 merchants in the Galle District.
The promotional event hosted by HNB at the Galle Fort Magistrate Court Square was the fourth phase of the ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ campaign launched by the CBSL last year. The extensive promotional campaign, a collaborative effort by the CBSL and 21 financial institutions and telecommunication partners, aims to create awareness regarding cashless payments via QR codes. 
“LANKAQR, the latest innovation in the financial sector, has higher traction than any previous initiatives or technologies. The fact that it coincides with an important time in our lives, when we need to continue transactions as normal as possible while exercising social distancing and other hygiene requirements to keep the pandemic at bay, is indeed a silver lining in an otherwise dark grey cloud looming over the whole world. 
“The staggering statistic of onboarding 190,000 merchants so far is by no means a small number, given that financial institutions were only able to bring in under 100,000 merchants to use POS machines for card payments. Today, there are more people with mobile phones than cards, and even though this mode of payment will continue to evolve, so will the integration of cards to mobile phones, establishing one consistent application of payment for all in the future,” HNB Managing Director and CEO Jonathan Alles said. 
The event was held under the patronage of Chief Guest CBSL Governor Deshamanya Prof. W.D. Lakshman, Guest of Honour Member of Parliament Chandima Weerakkody, CBSL-appointed LANKAQR Committee Chairman and SDB Bank CEO Thilak Piyadigama, and CBSL Director – Payments and Settlements Department Dharmasri Kumaratunge, together with senior officials from the banks, including HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles and HNB Deputy General Manager – Retail and SME Banking Sanjay Wijemanne. 
Following the ceremony, several merchants in Galle were presented with the LANKAQR code to conduct transactions by the CBSL Director. Teams from HNB customer centres in the region were also on-site to help raise awareness among merchants in the area on the potential of cashless and contactless payment options available via HNB SOLO.  “The number of merchants converting to LANKAQR will be augmented further and we believe this number will soon cross over a million in the coming months. This compelling initiative has brought merchants and corporates, big and small, to offer their supply chains and customers an automated logistically sound payment solution that is integrated to one platform. The statistics we have for HNB for instance is quite compelling as well. While we are working on extending the facility at a national level, I would also like to recognise our teams down south who have done a phenomenal job in onboarding over 1,500 merchants in the region to LANKAQR and HNB SOLO,” Alles added. 
Launched in 2019 as HNB’s flagship digital payments solution, SOLO provides the convenience of digital transactions via the affordable, easy and widely-adaptable QR code, a more cost-effective option when compared to alternative payment solutions available in the market. 
Having already linked LANKAQR to SOLO, HNB is among the leading financial institutions and telecommunication partners driving a cashless QR-code based payments revolution that aims to make mobile phone payment apps and digital payments the standard for day-to-day transactions island-wide.
As LANKAQR is a common Quick Response (QR) code standard developed by the CBSL, merchants will no longer need multiple QR codes for different platforms.

NDB recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Centre in an effort to develop the SME and entrepreneurship sector in Sri Lanka. 
NDB Vice President SME Middle Market and Business Banking Indika Ranaweera said: “The exclusive financial solutions offered by NDB Bank towards the SME sector of Sri Lanka, especially in the light of the COVID 19 pandemic will be taken further with this partnership, in order to offer a comprehensive range of business development services under a recognised centre of excellence.”
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) is working closely with the Government to help resolve issues faced by the businesses through a consultative process, particularly SMEs and continue to offer business development services and other assistance required for business recovery. 
The partnership between the Chamber and NDB Bank is a two-phase program for COVID-19 Revival of Sri Lankan SMEs under Recovery; Revive & Rebuild: focused on midterm and long term solutions. 
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contribute to almost half of Sri Lanka’s economy and provide employment to more than 52% workforce. The SMEs are thus an important part of the ecosystem and it is imperative that they get access to the right infrastructure to grow.
Further, NDB also introduced the ‘NDB Jayagamu Sri Lanka’ initiative in order to create a pathway for Sri Lanka’s exporters, innovators and entrepreneurs to have the necessary means to target the companies that are looking to diversify their supply chain, thus bringing in much needed revenue into Sri Lanka.
The uniqueness of ‘NDB Jayagamu Sri Lanka’ is that it is more than just a loan scheme with loan approval in seven working days to assist entrepreneurs, exporters and innovators of the country. It is also a platform in which they will receive a boost to kick start their businesses as well as a place in which they will receive the support and the means to create new innovative ways to sell their wares. NDB, along with nearly 10 non-financial service and solution partners, will assist SMEs, innovators and exporters with financial and non-financial support.

Handing over the agreement by Visa Country Manager Sri Lanka and Maldives Anthony Watson (second from left) to DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva (third from left). Also present are Visa Worldwide Director MS & A Sri Lanka and Maldives Nalin Dissanayake (left), DFCC Bank Vice President/Head of Cards Denver Lewis (second from right) and DFCC Bank Manager – Merchant Acquiring Chrishan Jayamanne (right) 

DFCC Bank, with the aim of being the most customer-centric and digitally-enabled bank in the years to come, recently partnered with Visa to facilitate digitally driven, cost-effective transactions at micro merchant businesses and increase card acceptance among micro merchants in Sri Lanka. 
This partnership will further strengthen the transaction processing capability for merchants of DFCC Bank with its low transaction costs, while enabling their ability to shift from cash to accepting card payments.
With the Sri Lanka Micro Merchant Program, an initiative by Visa, the bank can process transactions for merchants at a lower cost. The high merchant discount rates offered to this segment have been the main challenge in getting such merchants to accept card-based transactions. With this initiative, the bank intends to bring the small merchant community into the sphere of digital transformation.
Commenting on this partnership, DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva said, “We are delighted to be a part of this program as it is another initiative that the bank has introduced to go cashless, and more so with a segment that uses physical cash to conduct their day to day business transactions.  We believe that this is a good challenge as we need to invest a substantial amount of time and effort that is required to educate them on current payment acceptance trends, introduce them to new technology and open up new opportunities, thereby increasing their sales by exposing them to new market segments. More so, the reduced transaction cost will certainly help these businesses to become more profitable, and the bank will be empowering micro merchants to improve their businesses by having access to digital payment acceptance solutions in order to make this market segment more competitive through the use of digital tools.” Visa Country Manager, Sri Lanka and Maldives Anthony Watson said: “In the wake of the pandemic, there has been an urgent need to support micro and small businesses, something that Visa has committed to, globally. In line with this commitment, we are delighted that DFCC Bank is now a part of our Micro Merchant Program for Sri Lanka. We look forward to helping them enable digital payments for small businesses through Point of Sale (POS) and QR-based payments, in a cost-effective and secure way.”
DFCC Bank is setting new standards in the market by providing android-based POS machines that are NFC enabled. Customers can complete a transaction by digitally signing on the screen, tapping to pay, or use a chip-based card, all secure methods of paying. They can also conveniently have goods delivered to their homes as the transaction can also be completed at the customer’s doorstep via these mobile POS machines. The cash flow of the merchants will also be enhanced as the transactions processed on these machines are settled to the merchant on the very next day. DFCC Bank also offers DFCC Pay Merchant app facilitating LankaQR and VisaQR payment acceptance to Merchants through mhe use of a mobile phone.

HNB Assurance PLC (HNBA) and its fully owned subsidiary HNB General Insurance Ltd. (HNBGI) haverecorded a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 1.175 b for FY 2020, growing 16% compared to the corresponding period last year, whilst the Group’s Gross Written Premium (GWP) reached Rs. 10.4 b for the year under review.
HNBA and HNBGI Chairperson Rose Cooray stated, “Year 2020 undoubtedly was a challenging year to all of us. However, amidst the unprecedented adverse challenges presented by the outbreak of this global pandemic, as a Group, HNBA was able to surpass the Rs. 1 b mark in PAT for the second consecutive year, auguring well for the agility and resilience of the businesses to quickly recalibrate itself in the midst the unprecedented calamity to continue to create and deliver value to all its stakeholders.”
Cooray added: “The Group remains well focused on what’s ahead and to further consolidate its firm footing in the market by curating its business strategies through efforts of cost optimisation, strengthening the Group’s investment portfolio and seizing market segments with high growth potential. I wish to thank the Board of Directors as well as the CEO and the executive committees as well as the staff and management of both companies for a job well done.”
Chief Executive Officer Prasantha Fernando said: “Our teams proved their mettle last year, by maintaining their resolute focus on the end goal, driven by an agile mindset, the thirst for prompt and meticulous execution and being focused on digitalisation; whilst as an organisation, our philosophy has always been putting people first, be it staff, agents, contract staff and customers. In this regard, these results that we are indeed proud to present have being achieved without any curtailment of their remuneration or benefits. The management team was able to successfully manage the change process with regards to adapting and evolving to the new normal as well as embracing technology that helped us operate in environs within which movement was constrained.
“The Group was able to surpass the significant Rs. 10 b milestone in GWP with a growth of 5% compared to the corresponding period last year. Interest Income of the Group saw a growth of 11% to Rs. 2.5 b even in spite of the decreasing interest rate regime that we witnessed, driven by portfolio growth and sound investment strategies. Total Assets of the Group increased by 19% to Rs. 31.7 b whilst the Total Liabilities of the Group grew by 18% to Rs. 23.5 b. Whilst we are pleased to continue to be rated A (lka) by Fitch Ratings Lanka for ‘National Insurer Financial Strength Rating,’ our Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) increased from 322% in 2019 to 338% in 2020 for the Life Business. HNBGI’s CAR too increased to 256% from 226% in 2019, both very well above the minimum regulatory requirements.”
Fernando added: “New product development too was undertaken to enhance our service to specific segments of the market which saw HNBA launch two products aimed at strengthening our foothold in the health insurance space with the launch of SupremeHealth Max and SuperCI, while HNBGI came up with a novel concept in motor insurance called Pay As You Claim. I am confident that the team will take on 2021 with a fresh sense of purpose and vigour.”

The Group’s financial position remains very strong and resilient as demonstrated by the Group Local Capital Summation Method (LCSM) cover ratio of 374% (1).
AIA Group Chief Executive and President Lee Yuan Siong said: “AIA has delivered another very strong performance despite unprecedented macroeconomic conditions and the operational challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Group’s financial position remains very strong and we increased the final dividend.”

We always look for every reason to pay a claim and, during the year, paid more than $ 16 billion in benefits and claims, providing vital financial support for customers. We extended additional protection cover to our customers and the wider communities where we operate, helping provide peace of mind in uncertain times.
“Following the restrictions on movement and in-person meetings, we accelerated the development and adoption of online and remote capabilities across our markets. We introduced remote sales completion, moved recruitment, onboarding and training online for agents, and launched simpler streamlined services and claim processes for customers. These new capabilities have enabled our businesses to continue operating smoothly in rapidly changing conditions.
Siong also said: “While 2020 was an extraordinary and challenging year, it has made me more optimistic about the future for AIA. Now more than ever, Asian consumers are acutely aware of the need for financial security and the need to protect the well-being of their families, making our purpose and propositions even more relevant. In 2020, we developed and implemented a new strategy which will transform AIA and position us to harness the powerful structural growth drivers of life insurance across Asia. I am confident that AIA is in the right business, in the right region and at the right time and we will continue to deliver our purpose of helping people live Healthier, Longer, Better Lives.”

What is CFA Institute Research Challenge?
The CFA Institute Research Challenge is an annual global competition that provides university students with hands-on mentoring and intensive training in financial analysis. Students work in teams to carry out an initiation of coverage (Equity research report) on a publicly traded company with the aim of arriving at an investment recommendation to buy, sell or hold the company’s stock. Teams that progress to local, regional and global finals must present and defend their analysis to a panel of industry professionals. 

CFA Institute Research Challenge 2020/21
This year’s competition began in November 2020. Each participating team was assigned an industry mentor from a pool of Sri Lankan CFA Charterholders. While the students worked on their equity research report, CFA Society Sri Lanka and Acuity Knowledge Partners armed them with necessary skills and best practices. During the preliminary local round, the participant teams submitted written research reports based on their analysis of Overseas Realty (Ceylon) PLC which was graded by a group of CFA Charterholders. 
The four highest scoring teams advanced to the presentation round of the local competition during which each team presented their research findings to a panel of judges and faced a 10-minute Q&A session. The presentations were the culmination of months of research; discussions with OSEA management, competitors and clients, investment research and presentation training. The combined scores of the research report and presentation determined the winner. 
The team leader of University of Sri Jayewardenepura Vindula Perera stated, “The CFA Institute Research Challenge not only exposed us to the world of equity research, but it also pushed us to uncover the best versions of ourselves. The bumpy rollercoaster ride towards the finish line demanded teamwork and endless hours of hard labour. However, the experience was fully worth it! We thank CFA Society Sri Lanka for providing us the platform, our industry and academic mentors for their guidance and support, and the colleagues from our university for their steadfast assistance.”
The team’s mentor Daham Hettiarachchi added in saying, “It was a great pleasure to be a part of the CFA Institute Research Challenge and to mentor an exceptionally talented and enthusiastic group of students from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. Further, it was an extreme delight to win the contest given the remarkable efforts put together by the other participating universities. With the same spirit, we are looking forward to representing Sri Lanka at the regional finals.”

Envisages world class data hosting services and 
value-added services to enterprises, SMEs and startups
Set to attract regional clientele to Sri Lanka with Tier 3 certified offshore data hosting services
Data centre located at Orion City to go live early in Q2FY2021







Rajendra Theagarajah, incoming Chairman of Digital Reality, a joint venture between St. Anthony’s Property Developers and Dialog Axiata

 




Digital Reality Ltd., a joint venture between St. Anthony’s Property Developers Ltd. (SAPD) and Dialog Broadband Ltd., announced the appointment of highly respected banking veteran, technologist and business transformation specialist Rajendra Theagarajah, as Chairman.
Theagarajah has been charged with leading its board, as Digital Reality gears up for the launch of Sri Lanka’s first and most advanced High Density Data Centre, at Orion City, in the hopes of ultimately securing mandates for data hosting services from leading corporates, SMEs, and startups, as well as offshore hosting for large corporates across South Asia.
“All of us at Digital Reality are proud to welcome Thea on board. During his time in the banking industry, he has spearheaded powerful technological transformations which laid the IT and operational foundation for the innovations in digital banking that are now coming online across the island. This ability to leverage technology and deliver results, while commanding the respect and admiration of the entire corporate sector, will be the catalyst to a new era in Sri Lankan IT capabilities,” Digital Reality Director and CEO Jeevan Gnanam said.
Established through a $ 5 million investment between Dialog Broadband and SAPD, Digital Reality’s upcoming 200-rack High Density Data Centre will offer globally competitive Tier 3 class infrastructure services, to support the rapidly escalating demand for computing power in an increasingly digital Sri Lankan economy. The new centre is expected to go live during the second quarter of 2021.
“Sri Lanka is a nation that is blessed in many ways, but especially with IT, we are yet to scratch the surface of this nation’s true potential. The fact that we are now able to establish Tier 3 certified data hosting services that are globally competitive, and yet significantly more cost-effective than countries like Singapore and Hong Kong, will yield immense opportunities.
“Our ultimate goal is to position Digital Reality to serve as the IT backbone for Sri Lankan enterprises of all sizes, as well as delivering the most reliable offshore data hosting and disaster recovery services for entities across South Asia,” incoming Chairman Theagarajah stated.
Theagarajah will be ably supported in his mission by an illustrious Board of Directors including Dialog Axiata PLC Group Chief Executive Officer Supun Weerasinghe, Dialog Axiata Group Chief Technology Officer Pradeep De Almeida, Orion City founder, technologist and serial entrepreneur Jeevan Gnanam, and WNS Founding Director Eric Selvadurai.
Theagarajah further noted that with major new developments such as the Colombo Port City, as well as the increasing demand for sophisticated IT infrastructure in Sri Lanka, Digital Reality would be well positioned to support the digitalisation journeys of Sri Lankan corporates. Meanwhile, the island’s historically low levels of seismic activity, strong global IT connectivity through multiple submarine cables, and extremely competitive cost structures, would make it an ideal choice for international organisations and investors alike.
Digital Reality’s entire High Density Data Centre will be optimally located at the Orion City IT Park in Colombo, providing a particularly valuable option for Sri Lankan enterprises seeking a convenient, cost-effective site for their primary data centres. This central location will enable easy access, world-class supporting infrastructure with strong capabilities to serve emerging and established economic hubs in Colombo, and in the areas around the Bandaranaike International Airport.
In addition to the data centre and related managed services, Digital Reality will also offer disaster recovery solutions and aims to launch a portfolio of value-added services, ultimately enabling a new breed of technologies such as AI, Machine Learning and Data analytics to help accelerate the digitalisation of Sri Lanka.

The Association completed a decade of service in 1998 and the event was celebrated in a fitting manner by organising several activities for three days. The main event was the symposium on ‘Banking Beyond Year 2000’ for which the guest of honour was Barclays Bank London Chairman Andrew Buxton. In the years 1999 and 2000 the Association conducted the conventions on the theme ‘Excellence in Banking’ and ‘Towards a Safer Banking System’ respectively.

COVID-19 has disrupted most businesses globally and the insurance industry is no exception. Given the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, insurers have been compelled to accelerate their digital journeys and holistically digitise their operations. In this regard, the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) hosted a webinar on ‘What does it mean to be a truly bionic insurance company?’ with Boston Consulting Group (BCG) as its knowledge partner, on 23 February. 
BCG MD and Partner Prateek Roongta facilitated the event and BCG MD and Partner Pallavi Malani delivered the keynote presentation, which was followed by a panel discussion comprising Ceylinco Life Insurance Ltd. MD/CEO Thushara Ranasinghe, Fairfirst Insurance MD and CEO Sanjeev Jha, and BCG MD and Senior Partner Pranay Mehrotra. The panel discussion was moderated by BCG Colombo Principal Chilman Jain.
Pallavi Malani of BCG, while addressing 60+ CXOs from Sri Lanka’s insurance industry, explained what being ‘bionic’ means and outlined the imperatives for becoming a bionic insurer in the post-COVID-19 world. In order to achieve bionic outcomes, insurers need to integrate human elements with technology and not replace one with another. “There is a need to empower talent and enhance efficiencies by leveraging the right tech stack and data. However, businesses will still have to engage with new talent pools and create agile teams to effectively make the shift to bionic ways of working,” she said. 
Pallavi further discussed the five archetypes within which distinguished bionic players fall – i) Sales digitisers, ii) Data players, iii) Operations optimisers, iv) Innovators, and v) Digital natives. The discussion was made real with the example of PingAn, the largest Life Insurance company in China. Despite a salesforce of 1.3 million agents, PingAn has a ‘digital attacker agency distribution’ model and boasts of approximately 40% higher productivity than the second largest player in China. It has progressed from leveraging traditional technologies to mobile internet, to now using artificial intelligence (AI) across agent recruitment, training, agent management, sales model, and services. “PingAn has truly been a pioneer in digitising its entire sales force, at scale,” shared Pallavi. 
BCG Managing Director and Senior Partner Pranay Mehrotra emphasised on the need to use data as a differentiator. Data players are creating value by building digital foundations, developing new technology capabilities, implementing use case driven transformation, and improving overall data governance. 
In his opening remarks, Ceylinco Life Insurance Ltd. MD/CEO Thushara Ranasinghe said, “In 2019, the Sri Lankan insurance industry grew by 10.5% and in 2020, it grew by an estimated 16%. Despite the lockdown, insurers were able to witness steep growth, proving that adversity reveals genius”. He stated that the pandemic took everyone by surprise and rendered all business continuity manuals irrelevant. Nevertheless, Ceylinco was able to quickly adapt to the changing situation and recover from the initial shock by installing proper infrastructure in place. 
Sanjeev Jha of FairFirst Insurance said, “COVID-19 has taken away our choice to invest in digital initiatives or data optimisation. Bionic is the need of the hour. Insurance companies typically are data intensive and cognisant of risks. Organisations that don’t become digitally sensitive would miss the race.” 
In line with this chain of thought, Pranay from BCG emphasised the importance of transforming the agency channel. “COVID-19 is expected to accelerate digitisation of the agency channel. Omni channel is expected to be a norm in the future. While it hasn’t happened in the last 12 months, a war for talent is imminent. Digitally evolved companies will be better positioned to capture, share, and create value as opposed to their traditional counterparts,” he said. 
When asked about strategic initiatives being undertaken by their organisations, both CEOs had some valuable insights to share. Ceylinco, a company with a primarily physical model was compelled to make the shift to video doctor appointments, organise trainings for customers to make online payments, enable digital platforms, and facilitate remote ways of working. At FairFirst, the focus was on organisational transformation as well as digitisation. To achieve this end, the company has adopted agile ways of working and a people strategy that explicitly factors this evolution towards a digital future. In addition, ‘Click to Claim’ – an initiative to assess damages in motor accidents, ‘work from home’, fraud analytics, and customer journeys are the focus areas. 
In conclusion, Pranay from BCG shared three key steps for insurers to kick-start their bionic journey: 
Create digitally enabled core processes like sales
Create a fund to invest in future-looking business models 
Begin the cultural shift now as the migration has a long gestation period 
The webinar ended on an action-oriented note, with insurers feeling motivated to kickstart the transition from normal to the ‘new normal’.

Non-Performing Loans at 60% below the industry average
Profits increased by 47%
Portfolio grew by 5%
Deposits rose by 19%
Offered over 64,000 moratoriums


Commercial Leasing & Finance PLC (CLC) has delivered a powerhouse financial performance despite the wider economic and industry volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In a statement CLC said it recorded excellent numbers for the first nine months of the financial year ending 31 December 2020, despite challenging market conditions faced by the Non-Banking Financial Institution (NBFI) industry. 
Profit Before Tax grew to Rs. 2.3 b as at 31 December 2020, over the first nine months of the financial year under review. CLC recorded Profit After Tax of Rs. 1, 922 m, reflecting an increase of 65% over the previous year. 
Cost of funds reduced by 23% while overheads increased by only 3%. The company’s performance is a result of excellent management of its Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) and cost of funds, while sustaining revenues by maintaining its product mix optimally. 
CLC’s low NPL ratio compared to the industry is a result of its well-secured asset base and superior credit quality. Maintaining low NPLs despite the adverse impact on the market during first and second waves of the pandemic is a testimony to strong customer relationships the company has built. 
Further, CLC’s total assets exceeded Rs. 72.2 b during the period under review, making it one of the largest NBFIs in the country. CLC’s portfolio is well-diversified into all sectors of the economy - spanning auto finance, agri finance, SME finance, microfinance, Islamic Finance, gold loans, and receivable finance through factoring. 
Equally significant is the growth of its deposit base by 19% during the period under review which reflects public confidence in the company’s financial stability. CLC’s capital base exceeded Rs. 21 b as at December 2020, recording a 19% increase, which is far above the regulatory requirement with a Tier One capital ratio of 20.95% against Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s mandatory level of 6.5% and with Tier Two capital at 20.13% as against the regulatory requirement of 10.5%. 
Expanding further, CLC Executive Director/CEO Krishan Thilakaratne said: “Our excellent nine-month performance is a result of top notch credit quality maintained over the years. We are optimistic about ending the financial year with even stronger results. Looking ahead, we plan to further expand our branch network by 15 more branches in the next financial year in order to leverage the high equity and brand value enjoyed by CLC across the country.” 
As a further testimonial to its robust financial performance, CLC was reaffirmed as SL (A) stable by ICRA Lanka Ltd., which reaffirms its stability for customers.
Commenting on the exceptional nine-month financial results, CLC Chairman Priyantha Fernando said: “CLC has recorded exceptional Profit Before Tax (PBT) and Profit After Tax (PAT) over the last 10 years – and in the same vein, we expect to close the 2020/21 year with a PBT between Rs. 3.2 b to 3.5 b, which is an impressive achievement under the dismal market conditions – as indicated by these sound nine-month results. The GDP has been on the decline since the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 outbreak, but despite the economic slowdown CLC has displayed resilience by putting in place pillars critical for sustained growth. During the period under review, we strengthened the risk management framework which has helped us to proceed on a more targeted path under the able leadership of the CEO and the management team. Customer engagement has been another key pillar because finance is a relationship business and CLC has yet again risen to the occasion - holding the umbrella of financial security for customers in their difficult times.” 
Supporting customers in the time of need, CLC granted over 64,000 moratoriums during the year to those whose livelihoods were affected due to COVID-19. CLC is already having a notable impact at the grassroots, touching the lives of 150,000 households. 
CLC’s IT infrastructure and digital platforms were already primed and prepared for handling large volumes of digitalised transactions, which made it possible for the company to deliver uninterrupted services free from inconvenience to its large customer base. CLC’s robust nine-month financials reflects its trajectory for closing the financial year 2020/21 on a resounding note.

Holds program in Northern Province to further strengthen micro and SME sector

As part of BOC’s continuing efforts to help small-scale entrepreneurs emerge from the financial and operational challenges experienced on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bank took its popular Business Revival Clinic to Kilinochchi in late February.
On 23 February, the program held in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Kilinochchi District) drew large numbers of the bank’s micro, small, and medium scale fisheries-based customers.
The entrepreneurs received an opportunity to participate in a day-long program conducted by BOC, with a series of sessions allowing for direct interaction with the bank’s and Executive Management personnel and area plus branch managers, to voice their business concerns.
The bank’s Executive Management was represented by Assistant General Manager (Northern Province) V. Sivananthan and the event also drew the participation of Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources – Kilinochchi District Assistant Director K. Mohanakumar. Other lead forum participants included Area Manager (Jaffna East) S. Nethananthan, Manager (Kilinochchi Branch) K. Alan Jeyaharan, and Manager (Mulankavil Branch) S. Sivarupan. 
During the clinic, fisheries-focused customers from Kilinochchi and surrounding areas presented their entrepreneurial challenges to bank officials, with attention paid to identifying the reasons for business failure and subsequently receiving customised solutions to address exact concerns. Topics ranging from capital expenditure, operating expenses, to specialist loans were discussed as part of the program, with advice given to help entrepreneurs revive their businesses amidst the ongoing pandemic-affected economy. 
As part of the program, the bank raised awareness among entrepreneurs on fisheries-specific loan facilities offered through BOC’s Divi Udana scheme, which carries specialized individual loans for business tasks ranging from the purchase of fishing nets to building of tanks. 
The bank’s Business Revival and Specialist Loan Clinics across the island have been well-received by entrepreneur communities across sectors such as fisheries, prawn farming, and pea cultivation, further strengthening BOC’s position as the industry-leader in facilitating development loans, with particular emphasis currently on boosting Sri Lanka’s vibrant yet hard-hit micro and SME sector.

Rs. 1.2 b processed in December 2020 
Average Rs. 950 m in transactions per month 


PAYable Ltd., Sri Lanka’s leading cashless payment solution provider, announced that it has processed Rs. 15 billion in transactions on its platform to date. Commenting on the milestone, CEO and Co-founder Yohan Wijesiriwardane said, “PAYable entering the cashless ecosystem in 2016 was a gamechanger; we disrupted the existing status, empowering MSME merchants who previously were not eligible for cashless payment terminals from banks. By empowering these merchants, we were able to change the way they manage and grow their revenue.”
The PAYable solution is highly robust and scalable, compliant with the highest international payment security standards and the company believes it has just scratched the surface of what is possible in a ‘cashless Sri Lanka’. 
“We are on track to introducing a pioneering range of solutions to strengthen both our banking partners and merchants, with support from our partners internationally. These innovations will benefit and bolster our current base of card-present and card-not-present solutions, which includes the new PAYable PRO and the PAYable MINI, our Android payment acceptance terminals, the sleek and simple Keypad MPOS that pairs with Android and iOS devices and the recently-launched PAYable Online, a web platform that gives merchants strong new services such as online store creation and integration of social media selling in a formal invoicing system.”
Working in partnership with several of Sri Lanka’s leading banks, PAYable has been a major driver in the growth of the cashless payment ecosystem in Sri Lanka, by enabling the significant increase of cashless payment acceptance points from 2.0 to 3.8 for every 1,000 Sri Lankans.

The computerisation initiative is in line with the policy statement ‘Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour,’ where 183 out of 1,074 Samurdhi Banks have already been computerised.  
The computerisation of 86 Samurdhi Banks in the Gampaha District is also currently in progress, where 20 of them have been computerised. The first computerised Samurdhi Bank in the Gampaha District – Minuwangoda Yagodamulla, was declared opened by Tourism Minister Prasanna Ranatunga on Monday (8).
Ranatunga stated that the computerisation of Samurdhi Banks will be done for the convenience of 1.7 million Samurdhi beneficiaries. He also pointed out that the Government is working to strengthen the Samurdhi movement, which was set for a natural death under the previous regime.
A project to identify and empower 200,000 Samurdhi families has also been launched, where a loan relief program for entrepreneurs through the Samurdhi movement is now in operation as well.
The Minister said that the construction of houses under the Saubhagya Housing Project is also being implemented at present. 
Ranatunga claimed that the previous Government of good governance had acted contrary to the objective of the Samurdhi movement, which was started to eradicate poverty. “The good governance Government had taken steps to provide Samurdhi benefits to the undeserving during the period,” he said.

DFCC Bank has had a long heritage of operating as Sri Lanka’s leading development bank. Over the course of many decades, the financial institution has played the important role of financing and guiding SMEs to grow. 
During this time, the bank has paved the way for many SMEs to venture out into the large corporate space. Despite DFCC Bank’s transition into a fully-fledged commercial bank in 2015, it continues to be the benchmark in terms of supporting the country’s SMEs.
The bank has been able to systematically introduce various products and services to specifically cater to the timely requirements of SMEs in Sri Lanka. These products complement the gamut of existing services such as term loans, leasing facilities, hire purchase facilities, guarantee facilities as well as consultancy, workshops and advisory services to SMEs and budding entrepreneurs.
One such example was the launch of the ‘DFCC Sahanaya’ concessionary loan scheme aimed at providing relief to SMEs in the export-related sector. Under the scheme, the bank disbursed loans and permanent working capital loans at a low annual interest rate of 9%, providing immediate relief to export-related businesses. It also aimed to assist exporters who failed to obtain low-cost funding under the Central Bank’s Saubhagya COVID-19 Credit Scheme due to limited availability.
DFCC Bank is also among the preferred banks to on-lend Asia Development Bank’s (ADB) funds to SMEs. Under the ADB-funded Emergency Response Working Capital Loan Facility for Covid-19 affected SMEs, the bank has been disbursing loans to SMEs up to Rs 10 million at 4.75% interest rate with repayment period up to three years including a six-month grace period. DFCC Bank also participates in the ABD funded Tea Smallholder Credit Line and Rooftop Solar generation credit line for related projects.
A critical importance has been placed in the advancement of DFCC Bank’s digital product offerings which are also in line with the expectations of SME customers. The aptly named DFCC iConnect, a fully integrated Payments and Cash Management (PCM) system empowers the bank’s SME customers with access to their account transaction information from any location, locally or globally, at their convenience. The success of this product resulted in DFCC Bank clinching the title of No 1 Cash Management Service Provider in Sri Lanka by Euromoney, the prime magazine of the global financial world.
The launch of the QR-based DFCC Pay App has also empowered SMEs with the power of carrying out cashless transactions. As the world moves away from physical currency, the LANKAQR certified application is expected to usher SMEs in moving into formal sectors. The DFCC Pay App permits customers to conduct their retail transactions using smart mobile devices through funds available in their current or savings account to the merchant’s account directly. Unlike other financial institutions, DFCC Bank ensures to engage with their SME customers in a very hands on manner. In order to obtain a full understanding of their requirements, the bank goes through the business plan of the customer and even analyses cash books to create a financial framework. This close relationship between financial service provider and SME customer is exactly what has resulted in the DFCC Bank name having such a reputed place among many SMEs in Sri Lanka.
During these uncertain times, DFCC Bank will continue to add value to its SME clientele by identifying potential customers in growth sectors, cultivate relationships, and spread insight through seminars and workshops. By leveraging its island-wide branch network and dedicated teams, DFCC Bank assures its commitment to continue to nurture and foster SMEs, in particular to emerge back stronger from the Covid-19 pandemic infused economic slowdown. Regardless of its transition to a commercial bank, to this day, DFCC Bank continues to stay true to uphold its heritage of giving the enterprises of Sri Lanka a firm foundation and a partner throughout their journey.

Following the theme for International Women’s Day 2021, ‘#ChoosetoChallenge,’ NDB Wealth calls for the need to focus on the importance of challenging oneself to change the biases and pre-determined conceptions about women and focus on creating a more secure, inclusive environment for women strengthened by confidence and independence. 
“Women have advanced greatly and have resourcefully dedicated their lives to achieve independence in career and family. However we see many women still aspiring to gain financial freedom to crown their efforts. This financial freedom will not only secure their futures but also the future of their loved ones,” commented NDB Wealth Fund Manager Amaya Nagodavithane.
Amaya added, “At NDB Wealth we admire the strength and capabilities of women and truly understand their aspirations. We encourage more women to take bold steps that will empower and help them reap great benefits in the years to come.”
NDB Wealth believes that for women, financial independence and security are essentialities.  It is crucial to help women overcome the financial hurdles they face and to make them strong and equal members of their communities. Aspirations can turn real – quicker and easier, when one decides to break out of conventional bank savings products and make bold and decisive decisions through sound investments. Sound financial planning using the money market fund ‘Money Plus Fund’ similar to a savings account or the stock and bond fund, ‘Growth & Income Fund’ for attractive returns can help create the ideal allocation for women to achieve financial independence.
NDB Wealth’s Growth and Income fund, a balanced fund, which invests in stocks and bonds, is ideal for the ‘bold investor’ who has a moderate inclination towards risk. The fund allows investors to take calculated risks. Income is generated from stocks as dividends and capital gains and interest from bonds which can be withdrawn anytime without a penalty.
While the money market fund, Money Plus, for Women from NDB Wealth is an excellent account that offers a range of benefits similar to that of a fixed deposit with the added flexibility of withdrawing funds at any time without a penalty. It is also ideal for those who are too busy to keep track of their finances since the income from the account is credited daily, relieving you of that extra burden. Money Plus offers a current yield of 5.70% per annum as at 24 February. 
It’s time to make a bold move. Speak to a relationship manager and set up your Money Plus or Growth and Income fund account or visit the website to explore other investment opportunities, or even connect with NDB Wealth’s exemplary team of financial planners who can help you and your family in achieving full financial independence, with all the benefits entailed therein.

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has announced that it has collaborated with UnionPay International (UPI) to enable QR code payment acceptance in Sri Lanka, enhancing the payment experience of UnionPay QR Wallet holders.
Commercial Bank is the first Sri Lankan bank to issue a unified QR code under LANKAQR specifications that includes the UnionPay QR code.
With this integration, the LANKAQR QR code generated by the Bank and provided to merchants will have UnionPay QR acceptance facility in addition to existing QR payment acceptance. Chinese and other tourists who have UnionPay enabled QR apps can scan the Commercial Bank’s LANKAQR QR code at merchant locations and pay for goods and services. 
The UnionPay QR can be integrated to local merchant websites to facilitate e-commerce transactions as well. A QR code generated using the Q+ merchant app can be shared with customers via different social media to conduct transactions, the Bank said.
Commenting on this latest initiative by Commercial Bank, the Bank’s Chief Operating Officer Sanath Manatunge said: “Inclusivity, interoperability, functionality and security are the key words in any cashless payment platform. As a leader in this sphere, Commercial Bank is constantly looking for ways to widen the user base for electronic and digital payments that cater not only to our own customers but for foreigners visiting our country.”
“Commercial Bank is the first issuer of UnionPay cards in Sri Lanka; we are very honoured to cooperate with Commercial Bank again to enable UnionPay QRC payments in Sri Lanka. UnionPay QRC users all over the world will be able to bring more business to merchants who accept QRC payments in Sri Lanka. This fully reflects UnionPay International’s support for local supervision and is believed to be conducive to Sri Lanka’s economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic,” said UPI Hong Kong Branch General Manager Michelle Shao.
The UnionPay QR is generated in conformity with EMVco standards and in accordance with guidelines provided by Union Pay International. Hence it ensures interoperability and customers in mainland China can also use this QR in addition to UnionPay customers in other countries and regions around the world.
Notably, Commercial Bank is the first bank to issue the UnionPay Credit and Debit Cards in Sri Lanka, which is the card brand with the largest cardholder base in the world.

Sri Lanka’s leading non-bank finance sector company, People’s Leasing & Finance PLC joined hands with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to promote ‘Rata Puraama LANKAQR’ innovative digital payment program in Galle District. The program organised by the CBSL was actively participated in by 21 prominent financial institutions and telecommunication partners in Sri Lanka.
The general public and the business community in Galle District were made aware of making hassle-free payments via LANKAQR – quick response digital payment code.
CBSL Governor Deshamanya Prof. W D Lakshman participated as the Chief Guest and the Guest of Honour was MP Chandima Weerakkody. 
CBSL appointed LANKAQR Committee Chairman and CBSL Director (Payments and Settlements) Dharmasiri Kumaratunga, Southern Province DIG Rohan Silva and SDB Bank CEO Thilak Piyadigama also participated. 
The team also comprised People’s Leasing CEO/GM Shamindra Marcelline, DGM (Marketing) Laksanda Gunawardene, DGM (ICT) Prabhath Gunasena, Chief Manager Operations Hasantha de Silva, PLC Galle branch manager Ajith Seneviratne and a host of customers and the public. 
A significant occurrence at the event was a popular artist living in Galle Fort extending his services to do a portrait of People’s Leasing CEO/MD Shamindra Marcelline. The due payment for that work of art was made via LANKAQR – quick response digital payment code at that instance.
‘Rata Puraama LANKAQR’ program was initiated by CBSL on realising the importance of making payments online. Thus it is a customer-oriented and socially responsible move by the CBSL. People who use LANKAQR when doing their day-to-day transactions with merchants could keep cash transactions at bay. This is a credible transaction method which facilitates payments to merchants directly using customers’ bank accounts. The merchant would receive a SMS immediately and the money will be credited to his/her bank account on the following working day.
People’s Leasing via IT related innovations has added immense value to the finance sector by introducing hassle free transaction methods. By adopting LANKAQR – quick response digital payment code the company would add more value to its financial transactions for the benefit of its customers.
Marcelline said, “Rata Puraama LANKAQR introduced by the CBSL is a timely venture. The awareness program done in Galle District teaming up with People’s Leasing Company was highly successful.”
He added: “In a volatile environment with a pandemic prevailing, it was of utmost importance to introduce a payment system like LANKAQR that facilitates cashless transactions. The merchants who are connected with the LANKAQR payment system facilitate this transaction system and it is very hassle-free for people to transact with them. This payment system doesn’t have any hidden charges and it doesn’t require people to keep money in hand.”

Kuala Lumpur, (Reuters): Audit firm Deloitte PLT will pay Malaysia’s government $ 80 million to resolve all claims related to its auditing of accounts of scandal-linked state fund 1MDB and its unit SRC International from 2011 to 2014, the finance ministry said on Wednesday.
Deloitte has been under scrutiny for its role in auditing the financial statements of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state fund at the centre of a globe-spanning corruption scandal. 
Malaysian and US authorities say at least $ 4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB between 2009 and 2014 by high-level officials of the fund and their associates.
“The successful out-of-court settlement with Deloitte will expedite the payment of monies to fulfil 1MDB and SRCs outstanding obligations, which would otherwise be delayed by potentially protracted and costly court battles,” the ministry said in a statement.
Deloitte did not immediately respond to a request for comment and made no mention of the settlement on its website or social media accounts.
The government said in November that 1MDB was still $ 7.8 billion in debt following the scandal.
The agreement with Deloitte is the largest 1MDB-related settlement involving an audit firm in Southeast Asia, and is the latest after similar deals reached with US investment firm Goldman Sachs and Malaysian banking group AmBank.
Last week, AmBank said it would pay $ 700 million to settle claims related to 1MDB probes, a hefty sum that the group said would have a material impact on its earnings.
The ministry said the deals would not affect or compromise Malaysia’s claims against fugitive financier Jho Low or other parties wanted in connection with the 1MDB scandal. Low has consistently denied wrongdoing.
In 2019, Malaysia’s securities regulator fined Deloitte 2.2 million ringgit for failing to report irregularities in relation to an Islamic bond issued by a 1MDB-linked company.
After the US Justice Department filed civil lawsuits in 2016 over 1MDB, Deloitte said the 1MDB finance statements it had audited should no longer be relied upon.

Industrial & Commercial Bank of China is the largest with almost $ 5 t in total assets


China’s banking system can trace its roots back all the way back to the tenth century Song dynasty. Since then Chinese society and politics have changed significantly, going through several cultural and political upheavals in its history. 
China’s banking system as we know it today is the most robust and largest banking system in the world. According to data presented by TradingPlatforms.com, five of the top 10 banks in the world come from China, with the largest being the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China with total assets of $ 4.9 t.

China’s ‘Big 5’ banks accounted for more than $ 17 trillion in total assets
The four largest banks in the world in total assets all come from China. Starting from the largest, these are; the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China ($ 4.9 t in total assets), China Construction Bank Corp ($3.9T in total assets), Agricultural Bank of China ($ 3.7 t in total assets) and the Bank of China ($ 3.6 t in total assets). Rounding out the top 10 list is the Postal Savings Bank of China ($ 1.4 t in total assets), giving China five representatives in the Top 10 list.
Combined, China’s ‘Big 5’ have a total of 17.6 t in total assets which accounts for almost 70% of the total assets of the entire top 10 list.

5 other banks on the Top 10 list are from Europe
Apart from China’s banks, the five other banks on the list all come from Europe. Banco Santander from Spain is the leading European bank with $ 1.8 t in total assets. The next two largest banks in Europe, Group BPCE ($ 1.51 t in total assets) and Societe Generale ($ 1.5 t in total assets), are from France. Germany’s Deutsche Bank AG is the last European bank on the top 10 list with total assets of $ 1.45 t.

China’s largest banks are all State-owned in contrast with Europe’s largest banks
A look at the overall picture of the total assets of the top 10 list shows that there is a sizeable difference between the largest banks in China and the largest banks in Europe. None of the European banks holds more than $ 2 t in total assets while all four of China’s largest banks all hold total assets of more than $ 3.5 t.
One of the factors that explain the significant difference in wealth between China’s largest banks and Europe’s largest banks is the ownership of these banks. All five of China’s largest banks on the top 10 list are state-owned while all the European banks are privately owned. This means that the largest Chinese banks act as the main funding source of government projects which always equate to large investments.

The qualities of care, concern, of coming together to help each without expecting anything in return was the hallmark of the bygone era when people’s lives were more serene. In Sri Lankan culture, a true microcosm for an ideal and harmonious society, people rallied around each other selflessly – offering their services to others, with the entire community coming together as an extended family to help each other in times of need. 
The noble objective of these people was to be of help and to support their neighbours to overcome challenges without expecting anything in return. This fascinating concept, called ‘Aththama,’ is enshrined in the values of all Sri Lankans – and Pan Asia Bank, as The Truly Sri Lankan Bank, is now breathing life into this concept by reviving this warm and generous tradition of helping each other in society. When people experience difficulties and financial constraints, this concept of ‘Aththama’ comes to their help, symbolising unity and emotional bonds that go beyond family. 
Refreshing these ancient values of harmony, unity and selfless held as The Truly Sri Lankan Bank, Pan Asia Bank has taken on the mantle of gently reminding people of these age-old values which are much-needed in today’s world, when many people are struggling with the pressures of daily life and need a helping hand. More than ever today, people need to come together to help each other as a family, is the message Pan Asia Bank wants to convey as it highlights traditional Sri Lankan values.
As the Truly Sri Lankan Bank, Pan Asia Bank is acutely aware of the needs of the people, both at the grassroots and at the top of the economic pyramid – and has always devised banking products and solutions that address their concerns and fulfill their aspirations. Determined to live up to it brand promise of being the Truly Sri Lankan Bank, Pan Asia Bank is poised to launch a product that reflects the spirit of ‘Aththama’ – help, cooperation and unity, when people need it the most and which pulls them out of hopelessness into a new dawn.

BOC Deputy General Manager Sales and Channel Management Priyal Silva and Department for Registration of Persons Commissioner General P.V. Gunathilaka signing the MoU  

Being a responsible corporate citizen and the country’s No. 1 Bank, Bank of Ceylon sets an example by complying with the customer identifying regulations requested by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to ensure a healthy maintenance of the country’s financial system. 
In this regard BOC joined with the Department for Registration of Persons (DRP) through an online system to scrutinise the validity of identification of documents and obtain the validity of the customer national identification number (NIC) at the part of customer onboarding as and when required. With the signing of the MoU, Bank of Ceylon will involve itself with the DRP’s roadmap for ‘Central Data base for Citizen Information’.
“Being a responsible Government financial institution, it is a responsibility of the Bank of Ceylon to align itself with other Government institutions and join in the initiative of developing the Country through the carefully planned digital road map laid by the Government of Sri Lanka. BOC identifies this initiative introduced by DRP as one such very important part of the overall development plan,” stated Deputy General Manager Sales and Channel Management Priyal Silva.
This initiative will improve the process of obtaining accurate customer identification on time which is an essential requirement in undertaking banking transactions. It will benefit the customer by ensuring banking transactions are met on timely basis on proper identification of the customer. This will enable the BOC to view data and images of documents related to the National Identity Card submitted by any customer with his or her consent in order to verify the authenticity of the particulars of the National Identity Card, of the person who intends to open a BOC Account via the BOC Digital/Manual Account Facilities and the other banking services provided by BOC. 
This is an industry-wide solution formed in accordance to the requirements of the CBSL and the bank has been permitted to access the web-based system developed by DRP for authentication and verification of the correctness of particulars of the NICs.
The Memorandum of Understanding between Bank of Ceylon and DRP took place at the DRP premises at Suhurupaya, Battaramulla recently with the participation of BOC DGM Sales and Channel Management Priyal Silva and other officials from the bank and officials from the DRP.

Across different industries and geographies, COVID-19 has changed the ways people engage with one another. Numerous health regulations—from social distancing to self-quarantine—have been conscientiously imposed by authorities across nations to overcome numerous pandemic-related challenges, even to the extent of shifting a large proportion of physical transactions to digital and remote platforms. This transformation continues to affect operations in many industries, including insurance. 
With the continuation of physical distancing measures, industry experts point out that the insurance distribution model will be impacted both in the near term and longer-term. As the world progressively moves towards the ‘Next Normal’, our dependence on remote and digital technologies will not cease at any point but pick pace at a faster rate.   
In such a context, many insurance companies are already taking vital steps to address the pandemic’s immediate impacts, including the expansion of customer service channels into digital platforms and onboarding employees to a remote setup. The next challenge for insurance companies, on a longer-term, is reimagining their distribution model in a more digitally-oriented world. 
Although many local insurers, including Softlogic Life, took key steps to adapt and respond to these pandemic-driven changes, two key highlights overshadowed the industry’s progress. First was the drop in new business and premium collection due to movement restrictions, and the second was the challenges faced by agents when building new customer relationships remotely. However, a strategic mix of digital and in-person communications have facilitated us to overcome the situation to a great extent. The real challenge was maintaining the same relationship development model, in a less interactive, digital scenario.
To address these challenges,  local insurance companies need to reimagine their distribution model across three dimensions: customers, sales models and processes, which are also referred to as enablers. Focusing on these three dimensions will help local insurance companies to prepare for the next phase of challenges set forth by COVID-19.   

Addressing evolving client preferences
Understanding how customer preferences have transformed is the name of the game. It is safe to say that the pandemic has highlighted an increase in the awareness and importance of insurance in general. With this in mind, companies can reimagine current processes, experiences, and products to better fit life in the next normal, using a zero-based design. 
It is best to point customers in the direction of protection-based long term insurance policies, which has become a vital necessity in life as highlighted by the health pandemic. Solutions of this nature helps customers invest in a secure future, with real value. This offers higher benefits to clients, sales teams and to organisations, and gives companies a competitive edge to retain business stability. Since these policies require a long-term commitment, it demands a few detailed discussions with clients, since no one commits for big continues payments for 20/30 years without extreme explanation and convincing. However, streamlining paperwork and nitty gritties to digital is also important.Therefore, companies must strike a balance between digital and in-person interaction when it comes to pitching long-term financial commitments. 
Additionally, it is important to also leverage digital-only platforms to promote simple short-term insurance products that address more specific customer needs. However, it is advisable to not put all your eggs in one the metaphorical digital basket as it is still a highly competitive and unstable business model that can be replicated by competitors. Ideally, short-term Products based entirely on the digital market should be extremely simple, form just a part of a total solution, and adaptable enough to proact or react to market movements. 

Gearing your salesforce to operate in the next normal
When preparing your salesforce to face the next normal, Insurers should leverage multiple virtual tools to support teams to efficiently reach out to and service customers. This includes tools that offer employees snapshot profiles of each customer base to help better align the right product with the right customer. With digital becoming an increasingly close part of daily life, it is easier to  source and leverage this to ensure effective selling. So, training, a consistent flow of information, standardized selling processes and digital tools for communication makes new business acquisition more efficient for sales forces. 
A recent PwC report (https://www.pwc.com/sg/en/insurance/assets/insurance-2020-and-beyond.pdf) highlights that having an effective hybrid distribution force—a combination of internal sales desks and hybrid advisors (that use both in-person and digital channels)—will enable insurance companies to transfer remote capabilities to their skilled field sales teams.
For example, sales advisors of Softlogic Life currently work on a 100% digitally-supported sales platform, where post-sales operations of over 90% of the policies are managed via an auto underwriting platform. With these developments, the company secured over 90% of the budgeted total sales revenue last year, meeting all client requirements, including claims without any gaps in service standards.

Investing in digital tools: The ‘enablers’ to the rescue 
Digital tools, which I refer to as ‘enablers’, will bring a plethora of benefits for insurers, starting from ensuring resiliency in a crisis like the ongoing pandemic. These enablers will help organisations quickly respond to customers and insurance advisors’ present and future expectations while increasing the agency channel’s productivity. It is encouraging to see that many Sri Lankan insurance companies have realised the importance of digital tools for the customer and their salesforce as the number one priority to enable them. 
However, when investing in digital technologies, insurers should evaluate and ascertain gaps in the ideal customer and agent journey for their specific business. The findings will help them develop an agile road map tailor-made to their strengths and weaknesses to begin closing those gaps.
Data is another great enabler when transforming the distribution model. With vast amounts of data stored in legacy systems, insurance companies need to look at ways to mine these data and extract critical insights to infuse more resiliency into their distribution mechanism and address the demands of customers and advisors. 
Whilst distinctive in-person lead generation tactics are no longer a viable option, data-driven lead generations have kicked in to bring immense value for companies during the last few months. Furthermore, insurers can build advanced analytics models to recognise lifetime value-based customer segments within their current portfolio and build additional models for each segment to identify customers at risk of churning or lapsing. With right data models, the opportunities are limitless. 
In conclusion
Changing the distribution model will take time to implement. It does not only mean bringing novel technologies but also ingraining other capabilities to support the rest of the existing elements of the value chain, including claims and products. However, it is important to note that experimenting with different distribution models could be disastrous in the long term as well. Therefore, what is really needed is the continuous improvement of existing distribution models to match rapidly evolving market and environmental conditions. The distribution leaders that operate in the next normal will be the ones to begin work on 
the longer-term imperatives today.

A man stands in front of an electronic display at B3 Brazilian Stock Exchange after an automatic circuit breaker was triggered this morning - Reuters 

London, (Reuters): Just when developing economies were ready to bask in the post-COVID rebound in global growth, in sweeps a bond market blaze to scorch them again.
Most major investment banks were predicting a stellar 2021 for emerging market assets as long as one crucial snag – global borrowing costs rising too fast - was avoided. Well guess what, they are on a tear.
February saw their steepest monthly gain since Donald Trump’s shock 2016 US presidential election win and, though the move comes from record low levels, for emerging markets now carrying nearly $ 80 trillion worth of debt it has been painful few weeks.
The widely-tracked JPMorgan Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) is having its worst start to a year for a quarter of a century, currencies have recoiled and MSCI’s EM stocks index has just suffered its biggest weekly drop since peak COVID panic last March.
The carnage has been described as a bond bonfire by ING analysts and prompted some of those bullish investment banks like JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley to curtail their bets.
Rising developed market bond yields sting emerging markets in two main ways.
Firstly they push up borrowing costs. BofA estimates emerging markets will sell over three quarters of a trillion dollars’ worth of debt this year – $ 210 billion by governments and over $ 550 billion by corporates. Higher rates mean adding to government debt ratios that soared 15.5 percentage points across the top 60 emerging markets last year and have left 13 such countries with debt-to-GDP in excess of 100%.
Secondly, it cuts the premium existing emerging debt offers investors compared to ultra safe and liquid US Treasuries.
If the risk-reward calculation no longer adds up, money managers can quickly sell as was seen during the 2013 ‘taper tantrum’ when the Federal Reserve’s hints at ending its easy-money policies triggered an estimated $ 25 billion emerging asset selloff in just two months.
The effects of that episode were particularly severe in the ‘Fragile Five’ of Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey that had built-up large current account deficits that were funded by short-term capital inflows.

Boom time 
This time, investors are worried about at least some of those.
“Brazil and South Africa are countries whose combination of persistent weak growth, rising public debt, very steep yield curves with very high long-term real interest rates, has become a big source of concern,” said David Lubin, Citi’s managing director and head of emerging markets economics. “Mexico might also be on that list.” Still, the alarm bells aren’t ringing as loud now.
For one reason, US “real” yields, adjusted for inflation, remain low by historical standards, at about negative 80 basis points which keeps emerging market assets looking attractive.
By comparison, during the original taper tantrum, “real” US 10-year yields rose steeply from negative 75 basis points at the end of 2012 to positive 50 basis points by mid-2013.
And despite the huge rise in debts, last year’s recessions have helped to mostly eliminate current account deficits, limiting many emerging markets’ reliance on capital inflows and acting as a shock absorber against rising US yields.
A punchy recovery in global growth and fast-rising commodity prices should further help developing economies and even dig some out of a hole.
Moody’s last week cranked up its pan-EM growth forecast for the year to 7% from 6.1%, led by upward revisions to China, India and Mexico, and with $ 1.9 trillion of US stimulus now coming most institutions are doing the same.
“We could be at the door of a big, big economic boom,” said head of Barings’ sovereign debt and currencies group Ricardo Adrogu. “Some of these countries that seem hopeless today could actually be ok”.

Fragile frontiers 
Others will not be so lucky though.
Ethiopia is about to become a test case for the new G20 ‘Common Framework’ debt relief plan which stipulates private creditor debt must also be restructured, meaning the government has to default.
Others are expected to follow. S&P Global warned last week Belize was “virtually certain” to default in May. Laos and Sri Lanka have key payments in June and July, while JPMorgan lists 16 at-risk countries from Cameroon to Tajikistan sitting on a combined $ 61.4 billion of debt.
Tellimer’s senior economist Patrick Curran has dubbed the new group of vulnerable countries the ‘Fragile Frontiers’. It includes Jamaica, Tunisia, Ecuador, Sri Lanka, Belarus, Ethiopia, Laos, Bahrain and Oman.
Adding to the risks, not all emerging markets have started rolling out COVID vaccines yet. In Africa, for example, only a minority of countries are currently vaccinating and more variants are still breaking out.
Countries like Mexico, Jamaica, Panama, Mauritius, Montenegro, Jordan and Fiji where tourism accounts for close to 10% of GDP will wonder whether vaccines will come quickly enough to save their busy seasons this year.
“Virus mutations are a real thing I worry about,” said Raza Agha, head of emerging markets credit strategy at Legal & General Investment Management. “There’s already been several and there’s no way of predicting how many more there will be.”

Bloomberg: The biggest slump in Asian stocks since March hasn’t shaken the faith of strategists, who recommend buying regional cyclical shares on expectations of a strong economic rebound from the pandemic.
Growth can offset rate risks, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. team, including Timothy Moe, wrote in a note Monday, saying they prefer value cyclicals and short versus long duration ideas. Sanford C. Bernstein and Oanda Asia Pacific see Asian stocks weathering a global surge in sovereign bond yields to stay ahead of their US peers in 2021.
“We stay constructive on regional equities with modest downside risk from higher rates/volatility likely to create buying opportunities on corrections,” the Goldman strategists wrote. 
“We would not expect as sharp an equity reaction now, unless yields rise more significantly or the Fed signals changes.”
Despite its 3.7% plunge on Friday, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index has outperformed the S&P 500’s advance this year by three percentage points. Asia’s economic revival is predicted to outdo the US: the region’s emerging and developing economies are poised for more than 8% growth in 2021, almost twice as fast as a basket of advanced nations, including the US, International Monetary Fund projections show.
“Asia should lead global equities this year,” said Sanford C. Bernstein Asia Quantitative Strategist Rupal Agarwal, in Mumbai. The region is recovering the strongest, and rising Treasury yields would be more supportive of a rotation to Asian value stocks, she said.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was up 1.2% as of 1:27 p.m. in Tokyo, taking its gain this year to 4.5%.
Sovereign yields have jumped on the risk of faster inflation as economies accelerate. While higher long-term borrowing costs can dull the appeal of equities, some strategists say the US is more exposed than Asia because its stock market is costlier and has more growth shares, such as technology firms.
There may be some short-term downward pressure on the MSCI Asia Pacific index, but in the medium-term it’s likely to outperform, said Oanda Senior Market Analyst Jeffrey Halley. Unlike tech-heavy North American counterparts, Asia Pacific markets are dominated by cyclical industries, which stand to benefit from the acceleration in the global recovery, he said.
However, the picture isn’t uniform across Asia. North Asia is the most sensitive to growth, while select Southeast Asian markets are more sensitive to rates, Goldman strategists wrote in their note.
They upgraded Asia’s energy and insurance sectors to overweight, given the stronger reflationary backdrop, while lowering internet and media to neutral to trim duration risk.
Over the next 12-18 months, earnings outlooks are likely to be boosted by a solid Asian recovery J.P. Morgan Asset Management Chief Asia Market Strategist Tai Hui wrote in a note.
“A more diversified approach, both in terms of geography and sector, should help investors to navigate the upcoming bout of market volatility,” he said. (Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/buy-the-dip-in-asia-stocks-after-yield-led-drop-strategists-say)

HONG KONG (AFP): Equities rose in Asia on Monday as investors took a breather following last week’s heavy selling, with a drop in US Treasury yields giving markets some much-needed stability, while the passage of Joe Biden’s stimulus through the House provided some cheer.
However, observers warned that trading floors were still gripped by fears the expected global economic recovery will fuel inflation and force a hike in interest rates earlier than previously thought, removing a key pillar of the surge in world markets for the past year.
In a bid to calm markets, several central banks – including in Japan, South Korea and the European Union – sought at the weekend, reiterated their pledges to maintain their ultra-loose monetary policies for as long as needed. Australia’s led the way by ramping up its asset purchases to keep government yields low.
The steep losses last week provided an opportunity for bargain-buyers Monday, sending Asia rallying with Tokyo up more than 2%, while Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Mumbai, Manila and Jakarta put on more than 1%. Wellington and Bangkok also saw gains. Seoul and Taipei were closed for holidays.
London, Paris and Frankfurt all rose more than 1% at the start of trade.
News that Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine had been given the green light by US regulators – paving the way for a quicker rollout of inoculations – added to the positive sentiment.
However, fears about a spike in inflation continue to linger, and while the imminent passage of Biden’s vast rescue package is expected to bring crucial relief to the economy and struggling Americans, many traders see it as likely to add to the upward surge in prices.
Analysts said reassurances from the Federal Reserve were not easing those concerns.
“The market is testing the Fed and global central banks as to how serious they are here,” Al Lord, at Lexerd Capital Management, told Bloomberg TV. “There are growth expectations and growing inflation concerns, and that’s playing out in the markets.”

HDFC Bank Chairperson Wasanthi Manchanayake


 





HDFC Bank GM and CEO Palitha Gamage



A farsighted management strategy has enabled HDFC Bank to achieve impressive financial results in 2020. This was despite operating in a very challenging environment due to the COVID-19 crisis and the resultant economic troubles. 
The bank has seen significant growth in key financial indicators. The profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2020 was Rs. 978 million. This is a sharp increase over the previous year’s figure of Rs. 774 million. The net interest income also rose from Rs. 2.9 billion to Rs. 3 billon over the same period. Total assets grew from Rs. 55.9 billion at end 2019 to Rs. 60.8 billion by end 2020. 
HDFC Bank Chairperson Wasanthi Manchanayake attributed their success to a number of factors. These include a practical strategy to deal with the COVID-19 crisis, efficient customer service, technological deployment and a diversified product range. “We performed well despite our obligation to serve the housing requirements of the people,” she noted.
HDFC Bank was established under a special act of Parliament which imposes statutory responsibilities. Its core business is providing housing loans for low and middle income people in Sri Lanka, with the majority of loans being disbursed for this purpose. However, it has a diverse portfolio that caters to a range of financial requirements.
Manchanayake was optimistic about the bank’s future. She said their plans for this year include expanding the branch network from 39 to 48 branches across the country, introducing new services and enhancing customer service levels. 
HDFC Bank General Manager/CEO Palitha Gamage said a proactive management strategy laid the foundation for their performance. “We prepared for the COVID-19 crisis well before things got bad,” he noted. According to him, the bank’s dynamic corporate culture enabled them to adapt to the evolving situation.
Gamage pointed out that they had provided much relief to borrowers affected by the pandemic. He added that last year, they offered over 21,000 moratoriums on loans amounting to Rs. 17 billion. These concessions cost the bank nearly Rs. 400 million in lost income. Most of the debt moratoriums – which began in April last year – were for a period of six months.
HDFC Bank had a proper system in place before the COVID-19 crisis became serious. This, along with the professional attitude of the management and staff, enabled it to emerge unscathed. The bank continued to operate in both curfew and non-curfew areas across the country. It also followed a prudent yet effective approach in operational cost and asset/liability management. 
“Our core banking system proved to be a great advantage,” said Gamage. He noted that it gave them the technological capability to work without disruption. Since its implementation in 2017, this system has greatly enhanced the bank’s efficiency and ability to offer convenience to customers. It has also facilitated the introduction of a diversified product range.  
During the pandemic, HDFC Bank utilised its fully-automated loan origination system. The paperless online approval system proved very useful. An advanced communication network with automated dual linkages also facilitated interaction between the head office, branches and customers. 
Digital technologies such as mobile apps greatly benefitted customers. An example is the JustPay platform operated by Lanka Clear, which enabled customers to pay utility bills, insurance premiums and mobile reloads, etc., in a secure and hassle-free manner using HDFC Prathilaba Savings account. To overcome constraints arising from the pandemic, virtual meetings were regularly held between senior management and directors. They were thus able to formulate strategies and implement decisions on a fast-track basis. In December, over 250 employees were promoted following virtual interviews. Corporate management was also restructured, and the branch network reorganised into six regional zones (from the earlier five) to ensure closer supervision by regional managers. 
Gamage noted that the bank has now emerged stronger and better prepared to face any challenge. “Like they say, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going,” he remarked. 
HDFC Bank Chief Financial Officer Anura Hettiarachchi said that despite the pandemic, the bank’s deposits had grown significantly. He noted that their savings and fixed deposits increased from Rs. 42.5 billion at end 2019 to Rs. 48 billion by end 2020. “As for our lending portfolio, we have maintained it at a steady level as before,” he added.
According to Hettiarachchi, the earning per share on profit has seen a positive trend. In fact, the basic earnings per ordinary share rose from Rs. 7.35 in 2019 to Rs. 8.90 in 2020. The bank’s stock presently trades at Rs. 40 to 45 in the market compared to the Net Asset Value of Rs. 87.
HDFC Bank is presently the market leader in housing development finance. It benefits from a unique state-private ownership structure. The controlling stake of 51% is held by the Government while private companies and individuals have a 49% share. It was a State entity until it was listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 2005, resulting in private sector investment. It thus benefits from the stability and security provided by the state coupled with private sector efficiency. 
Today, the bank offers a diverse portfolio of loan and savings products. Besides housing finance, its main activities are leasing, deposits, business loans, educational loans and pawning. It caters to customers with various financial requirements, including professionals, state and private sector employees, pensioners and SME entrepreneurs. 
HDFC Bank has been engaged in housing development finance for over three decades. It began diversifying its product portfolio in 2012 and ventured into new market segments. The new areas of business included leasing and SME loans. This bank’s diversification strategy was a success. Today, it caters to niche customer segments with innovative products that go beyond the core business of providing housing loans. 
In recent years, HDFC Bank has introduced new processes covering everything from administration to IT. Currently, it offers digital banking solutions including online payment and e-banking services branded as ‘HDFC Click’. Its core banking system has greatly supported its growth strategy.  
HDFC officials said their palmtop banking concept has proved quite popular. In fact, this doorstep banking service is currently used by thousands of customers. Among those who have benefitted the most from it are small-time businesspeople and the self-employed. Its appeal is due to the total convenience and sense of security it provides. 
Driven by a strong management team and energetic staff, HDFC Bank has much to be optimistic about. An advanced digital platform has laid the foundation for an innovative future. While enabling many people to realise their housing dreams, the bank also focuses on business growth and optimising returns to shareholders. It is a vision for long-term sustainability.

HSBC Sri Lanka Country Head of Wealth and Personal Banking Nadeesha Senaratne

 




The global pandemic has accelerated the shift to digitisation with faster transition journeys and the rapid adoption of digital channels, which will continue into the future. HSBC Sri Lanka has helped customers navigate and adapt to the changing digital landscape which will be essential for customers to fulfil their banking needs as part of the new normal. 
Over the course of the last 12 months, the bank has seen a significant increase in customers actively using its digital banking platforms. More than 75% of customer transactions are done digitally through the bank’s online banking and mobile banking platforms. This has resulted in a 117 percent growth in fund transfers compared to last year amidst the pandemic, which is a testament to Sri Lanka’s fast evolving digital behaviour. 
Today, with real time payments enabled, customers can make payments to anyone, anytime and also move funds across geographies if you are a non-resident Sri Lankan (NRSL) living overseas. 
Furthermore, e-statement penetration has increased from 50% to 75%. This means customers prefer e-statements to paper statements via mail which has seen many interruptions.

Enhanced digital banking platforms
With limitations on physical interactions and the emphasis on social distancing, HSBC is continuing to enhance its digital banking platforms to fulfil the needs of customers and closely match the personalised banking experience that was offered over the counter, by investing in new technology and placing focus on three key areas: Simplify banking; Servicing and messaging and Security.         
Over the course of 2020, HSBC invested $ 5.8 billion in technology to help transform the bank globally. With the goal of becoming the leading wealth manager in Asia by 2025, HSBC is committed to significantly invest in digital to enable clients to manage their wealth in their pockets supported by the trusted expertise of its people.
HSBC Sri Lanka Country Head of Wealth and Personal Banking Nadeesha Senaratne said:  “As a leading international bank, HSBC is continuing to invest in market –leading intelligent digital solutions to help customers engage with us, and enjoy the convenience to bank from anywhere, using their smartphones. We want every customer to have the bank in their pocket. Through our investment in technology we also want to bring truly personalised, seamless and integrated wealth to all our customers, enabling them to interact with us how they want and when they want, and this is more than just having access to the transactional services, but also borderless banking.” 
“In order to get there, we still need to focus and deliver on the important everyday services and features that customers need and expect. That means further strengthening our cybersecurity, making all kinds of payments and transfers fast and easy and making product applications instant,” he added.
As such, HSBC Sri Lanka will continue to accelerate its digital banking capabilities by offering the following innovations and new technology. 

Payments and transfers 
Digital onboarding for credit cards, loans and accounts 
Converting from paper application forms, HSBC now offers a digital banking experience for customers who want to apply for a credit card, loan or open an account without having to visit a bank branch. This will also enable customers to know if they are eligible for the aforementioned products in real time. 
In accordance with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL) guidelines issued last October, the bank plans to further enhance this service with a virtual Know Your Customer (e-KYC) within 2021 that would provide a streamlined onboarding process with a digital signature, to offer a truly end to end digital banking experience and help reduce the use of paper.

Account deposits, bill payments and credit card payments through CEFTS 
Customers can pay their utility bills or third party transfers online, as the bank has made the customer journey simpler and faster, so any repeat payments can be done instantly. HSBC credit card bills can be settled with 18+ other local banks through CEFTS in real time without customers having to visit a third party payment point or branch. 

Card payments through digital wallets
The bank partnered with market leading digital wallets – Upay and FriMi to offer customers the flexibility to make HSBC credit card payments in a safer and convenient manner. 
In January this year, the bank rolled out real-time credit card payments through cash deposits machines (CDM) at several of its branches. Customers will be able to use these machines as a self-service terminal, to deposit money into their credit card or bank account/s 24/7, with deposit receipts issued immediately. This will also help customers to avoid queues and filling out forms at branches. 

Servicing and messaging 
“We know customers are juggling busy lives and we want them to reach us when they need support. We have introduced a Web-Chat messaging service which is a convenient channel for our clients to get in touch with us if they don’t like conventional channels like talking to a bank employee at a branch or on the phone,” said Senaratne.
The bank also now offers credit card activation through SMS banking. 

Security
While all this is essential in enabling convenience, security plays a crucial role. HSBC has introduced many firsts as the leading international bank and was the first bank to issue ‘chip’ enabled Credit Cards in Sri Lanka, and in March last year further enhanced this to ‘Contactless’. As a new addition, Contactless-enabled Debit Cards were also introduced as a safe, simple and secure way to pay for everyday purchases – just tap and go. No signature is required for transactions up to Rs. 5,000 and it’s also quick and easy. 
“In order to keep our customers safe in addition to chip and contactless facility for both credit and debit cards, we have enabled a new and improved payment verification system – SMS OTP for online credit and debit card transactions. This provides an additional layer of security for customers,” added Senaratne.
When you make a payment a unique six-digit one-time password will be sent to your mobile number that is registered with the bank to verify your identity before the transaction is processed.

Becomes youngest local bank to cross Rs. 1 t in assets despite turbulent global market conditions 








Sampath Bank Managing Director Nanda Fernando




Looking back at its performance, Sampath Bank noted with pride that it was able to maintain its strengths across diverse parameters, as evidenced by the variety of local and international awards it won.
The bank was able to improve its ranking on many of the corporate leaderboards it was recognised on. In addition to constantly being recognised for its financial prowess, the bank continued to improve in terms of respect from other corporate peers as well as in its perceived value, two non-financial attributes that are crucial, yet extremely challenging to achieve during ordinary times, much less in times of such adversity.
The bank also saw its asset base cross the Rs. 1 trillion mark in 2020, a feat achieved by very few players in the industry. Sampath Bank achieved this milestone in a record 33 years, becoming the youngest bank in Sri Lanka to do so.
Given the volatile market conditions experienced during the past one and a half years, these achievements are a true testament to the strength and stability of Sampath Bank, its resilience and adaptability and the confidence placed in it by investors and customers alike.
“Right from our inception, we have strived to constantly innovate, transforming the nation’s financial services landscape and delivering greater value to all our stakeholders. Helping us earn the trust of our customers and shareholders, our efforts in this regard have been instrumental in shaping our financial success. They also continue to bring us ever more awards and accolades, both at home and around the world,” said Sampath Bank Managing Director Nanda Fernando. 
“On behalf of all of us at Sampath Bank, I would like to thank the nation for their love, respect and support, especially during these turbulent times. We look forward to continuing to serve them and add more value to their lives in the years to come.”
Sampath Bank was rated amongst the Most Admired Companies of Sri Lanka by the International Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (ICCSL), the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) and the Daily FT. 
The bank is one of only five companies to receive an honourable mention at the annual Most Admired Company Awards for the financial year 2019/20. The coveted award recognises companies, both listed and unlisted, that are a cut above the rest in terms of not just their financial performance but also the value they create for their shareholders, customers, employees and the wider community in general.
The bank continued to hold its position in the top 10 line-up in the 27th edition of the LMD 100, Sri Lanka’s pioneering listed company rankings for the financial year 2019/20. Sampath Bank was placed fifth in profitability and sixth in turnover in the latest edition of the ranking.
According to LMD’s Brands Annual publication for the year 2020, Sampath Bank emerged as the ‘Most Loved Brand’ in the Banking category and was the only bank to feature among the Top 10 ‘Most Loved Brands’, while it was also ranked fifth in the ‘Most Valuable Consumer Brands’ category, up two places from last year. In the list of ‘Most Respected’ Entities in Sri Lanka the bank rose two spots to sixth place, while it also moved up one place to fourth on the Business Today Top 30.
In terms of international recognition, Sampath Bank was acknowledged as Sri Lanka’s ‘Best Retail Bank’ and ‘Best Commercial Bank’ for the seventh consecutive year, at the World Finance Banking Awards organised by the UK based World Finance magazine, making it the only Sri Lankan bank to be recognised at this year’s edition and the only bank in the country to have received both these awards every year since 2014. The banker Magazine also ranked it among the ‘Top 1000 World Banks’, an adjudication made primarily based on Tier-one capital.
Recognition such as this further underscores Sampath Bank’s strong financials including steady profitability growth and healthy liquidity levels, as well as its steadfast commitment to customer service and innovation, as it looks optimistically towards the future.
Sampath Bank is a 100% local bank that has deeply rooted itself in the lives of the people of Sri Lanka. Established in 1987, the bank has become a state-of-the-art financial institution that continues to be a market leader today thanks to its constant innovation and customer-focused approach to business. 
It has introduced many firsts to the Sri Lankan banking sector including introducing ATMs to Sri Lanka, extended banking hours and slip-less banking to name a few. The bank continues to steadily transform itself into a technology-driven financial services provider while upholding our traditions and values.

Chairman Atul Malik


 





CEO Indrajit Wickramasinghe




In 2020, Union Bank crossed the significant milestone of completing 25 years of service to the nation. The year tested the grit and foundations of the bank in many ways and the bank emerged strong amidst challenges. While operational performance was impacted amidst the slowdown of economic activity, the
bank continued to focus on cost optimisations, effective resource and productivity management as well as prudent portfolio management to overcome these tough conditions. 
Despite the challenging backdrop, Union Bank increased its liquidity buffers prudently and was able to maintain a strong excess liquidity position. Fitch ratings in its 2020 ratings release affirmed the bank’s current rating, which was backed by the strong liquidity and capital. 
Union Bank stands confident with an industry-leading capital position alongside significant financial flexibility that effectively helps mitigate the pandemic induced economic impacts. The bank maintained a robust Capital Adequacy Ratio throughout the year reporting 16.95% total capital ratio as at year end, which was well above regulatory requirement levels.
Union Bank swiftly re-aligned its operations, prioritising its focus on the new market dynamics and customer inclinations that resulted from the pandemic. The bank executed an inclusive business strategy that ensured smooth continuity of its services while safeguarding the health and well-being of its customers and staff as top priorities. 
Significant investments were made in ensuring the health and safety of staff by providing alternate work solutions, work from home facilities as well as setting up additional infrastructure to facilitate a smooth work environment for critical staff that attended work despite lockdowns.
An imperative focus was placed on rolling out a cohesive plan across all customer segments to provide support to re-build their businesses and lifestyles with the implementation of the CBSL recommended relief schemes for COVID-19 impacted customers. 
In line with the CBSL directives and policy rate cuts administered to enable economic growth, Union Bank implemented a downward revision of interest rates on its lending products including credit cards. Moratoriums of capital and interest were extended to affected borrowers in-line with the CBSL’s financial relief package while a significant number of affected customers were granted debt relief outside the CBSL criteria, as per the bank’s internal credit policy guidelines. Amongst the schemes that were considered for moratoria were loans, leases, overdrafts, pawning and trade finance facilities. Non-performing borrowers eligible for relief schemes were also provided customised rescheduling, inclusive of waivers on accrued interest while withholding further recovery action. 
The bank’s loans and advances stood at Rs. 67,518 million. The deposits base of the bank stood at Rs. 82,384 million as at year-end and recorded a growth of 7.6% despite the low-interest environment. The bank’s strategic focus for low-cost deposits continued to bear results, supported by focused initiatives for CASA growth by the business units. The bank’s CASA portfolio reflected an excellent growth of 26.8% as at December 2020, increasing the CASA Mix of the bank to 30% in 2020 from 25% in 2019. 
As a result of the numerous reliefs extended to affected customers and due to the low-interest-rate environment, the bank recorded a Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 3.2 % in comparison to 3.6% in 2019. The bank’s NII was further impacted with the latest CBSL directive issued in November 2020 that mandated 60 days’ loan extension for moratoriums given in March 2020 at subsidised interest rates up to a maximum of 7%; thus leading to a reduction of interest earned on all such credit facilities repaid on Equal Monthly Instalments (EMI) basis.
The fee income was impacted by adverse market drivers and declined by 18.4% over the comparative year. This was an outcome of the cumulative effect of fee waivers extended as part of COVID-19 reliefs, a slowdown in trade income due to import restrictions and a drop in loan-related fees due to slower credit growth that prevailed during the year.
The Treasury performed exceptionally well, recording impressive capital gains that grew significantly by 84.2% YoY. Other Operating Income of the bank grew notably by Rs. 162 million led by foreign exchange income and backed by growth in customer transactions, depreciation of the currency and the reduction of swaps in 2020. 
The bank had no trading equities and has not invested in any equity fund as at the reporting date. 
The total operating income for the year was Rs. 5,890 million and recorded only a marginal drop despite the challenging market dynamics. 
The gross NPL ratio stood at 6.05% by year-end. The absolute NPL increase however was only Rs. 230 million, while an overall reduction in the loan portfolio caused the ratio to reflect an increase. The bank’s prudent approaches towards managing portfolio quality proved favourable in containing NPLs amidst market volatilities. 
The impairment charge recorded an 88.5% increase YoY. While its actual credit losses were low, the bank recorded significant provisions through management overlays to account for the deteriorating environment. 
Three sectors were identified as risk elevated industries and accordingly additional provisions were made for these by shifting stages. Further on the Economic Factor Adjustments (EFA), weightages assigned to the worst-case scenario increased with the transferring of weightages from best-case to worst-case on 31 December 2020 to account for the deteriorating environment. 
This had a significant impact on the increase in impairments, while the Treasury impairment figures also inflated due to investments denominated in foreign currencies, based on the country risk downgrade. The entire modification loss on account of COVID-19 moratorium scheme was recorded under the impairment charge as per the non-substantial modification method which is in line with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard–9 (SLFRS 9). 
The Total Operating Expenses were prudently managed through bank-wide cost management initiatives and were reported as Rs. 3,772 million, with a YoY decrease of 1.5%. 
The operating margin was Rs. 2,118 million and recorded a decline of 3.3% YoY as an effect of a 2.2% decrease of revenue against the 1.5% drop in costs. Excluding the 60-day moratorium impact of reducing the interest earnings to 7%, the operating margin would have improved by 3.4%.
Share of loss of equity accounted investees was Rs. 29 million for the year ended 31 December 2020. In the previous year, a one-off gain was reported from UB Finance amounting to Rs. 127 million due to tax reversals. The subsidiary profits were also impacted due to the macro-economic challenges of the year under review. Total taxes for the year was Rs. 777 million and was a drop of Rs. 417 million in comparison to the previous year.
The ‘Bank-only’ profit for 2020 was Rs. 605 million and was on par with the previous year. Profit of the bank including its share of ownership in subsidiaries was Rs. 577 million in 2020 and was a decline of 18.8% over the previous year, mainly because of the one-off income recorded at UB Finance in 2019. Other comprehensive income for the year was Rs. 183 million, while the total comprehensive income of the bank was Rs. 759 million.
The group consisting of the bank and its two subsidiaries, UB Finance Company Ltd. and National Asset Management Ltd., reported Rs. 623 million in profits after taxes, a decline of 22.6% over the previous year. Total assets of the group were reported as Rs. 129.6 million. The bank accounts for 95% of the total assets of the group and hence the group’s performance is mainly propelled by the bank. 

Operations and business continuity amidst challenges
Considering the impact of the pandemic on its customer bases, the bank’s key focus for the year was shifted to extending COVID-19-related financial relief to customers across corporate, SME and retail banking segments since March 2020, so as to not compromise on its promise to serve customers with the best-suited financial solutions and tools.
Under the CBSL-recommended scheme, self-employed personnel, foreign currency earners, SMEs and corporates in identified sectors were eligible for loan repayment moratoria from Union Bank. A gamut of relief measures was channeled towards SMEs, including fee waivers on cheque returns and stop payments among others.
As part of the relief efforts, around 58% of the bank’s SME portfolio was accommodated under moratorium schemes by year-end. The bank granted around Rs 1.3 billion worth of working capital loans under Central Bank’s ‘Saubhagya’ COVID-19 renaissance credit scheme to SMEs, aiding their rebuilding efforts. 
For impacted retail borrowers, the bank announced immediate extensions of credit card dues along with a two-month extension for all personal borrowings such as loans and leases. Retail banking relief measures included debt moratoria for all loans upon eligibility and credit cards related relief including minimum payment concessions and fee waivers. Following the second outbreak in October 2020, the moratoria for affected customers across all segments were further extended to ensure resilience amidst the continuous contraction of business activity in identified sectors.
Union Bank’s digital cash management solution, BizDirect, continued to offer its corporate and SME customers much-needed liquidity management efficiency while facilitating CASA and fee-based revenue for the bank during the year. 
Due to a growing inclination for digital solutions, many new corporate and SME banking customers were on-boarded to the product during 2020. In recognition of its success in transaction banking excellence, Union Bank BizDirect was awarded the prestigious ‘Best Cash Management Bank in Sri Lanka’ title at the Asian Banker Transaction Finance Awards 2020. Retail banking business was led by CASA acquisition, deposit mobilisation and Credit Cards portfolio growth. The bank continued to offer value to its cardholders through focused lifestyle savings that included discounts on shopping, dining, and e-commerce platforms along with 0% interest instalment plans. 
Despite lockdowns, curfews and regional isolation procedures imposed from time to time to curtail the spread of the virus, the bank provided uninterrupted banking services via its strategic business continuity plan that was executed through its branches, ATMs and other touchpoints. Union Bank’s Online Banking portal and Mobile Banking app were further enhanced in 2020, to facilitate a wider range of banking conveniences to users enabling contactless banking from the safety of their homes. 
Commenting on the 2020 performance, Union Bank Director/CEO Indrajit Wickramasinghe said: “Our agility and apt business continuity execution have allowed Union Bank to weather the macroeconomic storm in good shape. The bank has safeguarded the interests of its stakeholders amidst challenges and maintained healthy liquidity levels, and stands strongly capitalised to withstand the adverse environment in which we operate in. 
“We will continue on a path of cost optimisation and enhanced operational efficiency in the year 2021 in which we have re-strategised for stronger growth and will continue to leverage on our key strengths while ensuring the health and safety of our customers and staff as a priority when navigating in the new normal.”

Commercial Bank Chief Operating Officer/Executive Director Sanath Manatunge with the award




The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has been declared the ‘Strongest Bank in Sri Lanka in 2020’ by the Asian Banker Magazine, based on the strength of its balance sheet. 
This accolade was presented to the Bank at a virtual plaque presentation ceremony on 25 February during which it was recognised as the strongest bank, with 50 places separating Commercial Bank and the second highest placed Sri Lankan bank.
Commenting on this international ranking accorded to the Bank, Commercial Bank Managing Director S. Renganathan said: “This award is a testament not just to our resilience, but to our ability to grow in the face of adversity. Maintaining a strong balance sheet is crucial to our ability to continue to help our customers survive the effects of the pandemic.”
The 2020 Asian Banker Strongest Banks ranking which should have been announced between August and September of the year was delayed this time, to enable the Magazine’s research team to collate and incorporate the 2020 financial information into the assessment, to appraise performance during the pandemic. As such, this year’s ranking reflects some of the impacts of the pandemic on the financial performance of banks, the magazine said. 
The rankings for 2020 recognised banks and financial institutions that had stood through the unprecedented disruptions to the global economy caused by the pandemic and are well-positioned to play an important role to help economies recover and to restore livelihoods.
The Asian Banker award is based on a detailed and transparent scorecard compiled and analysed after an independent assessment of six areas of balance sheet financial performance – the ability to scale, balance sheet growth, risk profile, profitability, asset quality, and liquidity.
The ranking includes the strongest banks in Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Macau, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The Asian Banker has been publishing its annual ranking of the Strongest Banks in the Asia Pacific region on the basis of balance sheet strength since 2007. The assessment ranks the top-performing banks in each country by strength, an evaluation that is based on a belief that a strong bank demonstrates long-term profitability from its core businesses. The ranking is widely followed by investors, analysts, and the media as the leading source to assess the financial strength of commercial banks in the region.
The first Sri Lankan bank to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World and the only Sri Lankan bank to be so listed for 10 years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 268 branches and 887 ATMs in Sri Lanka.
Commercial Bank’s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets; Myanmar, where it has a Microfinance company in Nay Pyi Taw; and the Maldives, where the Bank has a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake.

A broker trades on his computer terminal at a stock brokerage firm in Mumbai, India - Reuters

BENGALURU (Reuters): Indian shares closed higher on Monday after the country kicked off an expansion of its COVID-19 vaccine campaign and data showed that the economy returned to growth in the December quarter.
The NSE Nifty 50 index gained 1.6% to end at 14,761.55, while the S&P BSE Sensex closed 1.53% higher at 49,849.84.
Both the indexes slumped nearly 4% on Friday as rising bond yields sparked a massive sell-off in global equities.
But with bond yields easing from last week's peaks and the US House passing a $ 1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, the MSCI world equity index firmed 0.5% on Monday.
Aiding sentiment at home was news that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was inoculated with the first dose of a home-grown coronavirus vaccine, beginning an expansion of the country's immunisation drive. Meanwhile, data on Friday showed that the country's gross domestic product grew 0.4% in October to December, compared with a revised contraction of 7.3% in July to September.
Private sector lenders were the top boost to the Nifty. The Nifty private bank index advanced 1.4%, led by a 3.7% jump in Kotak Mahindra Bank.
The Nifty media index gained the most among sectoral indexes, closing 4.3% higher.
The Nifty auto index added 2.4%, with carmaker Maruti Suzuki India rising 2.2% after it reported a near 12% rise in February sales.
Bharti Airtel ended down 4.3% and was the sole decliner on the Nifty 50. Rival Vodafone Idea finished 1.77% lower.
The losses came after Reliance Jio said on Friday it would offer mobile phones and unlimited services for two years at 1,999 rupees ($ 27.16).

By Ali Marikar-Bawa and Laisha Mirpuri

Private Equity (PE) is often defined as investments made into private companies. Similar to other investors, PEs follow the fundamental rule of ‘buy low, sell high’. PE capital is raised by institutional investors and high net worth individuals, looking to commit their money towards long term gain—a cycle that could last 10 years or more.
Funds invested through Private Equity are often used to finance new technologies, expand working capital, acquire companies (sometimes public companies which are then taken private) and strengthen a company’s balance sheet. PE is also used to transform an underperforming company with high potential to offer its investors a significant pay back on investment. PE typically invest in companies that are in the growth stage—i.e. companies that have seen two to three years of profitability.

What does the global PE landscape look like?
Global PE Assets Under Management – the total value of assets that PEs own and manage — was estimated at $ 4.5 trillion in 2019, and is expected to grow by 20% over 2025. In the US alone, it is estimated that the PE landscape is made up of 7,000+ investors with $ 900 b ready for investment, more than three times than that available to European investors.
Also, 19 of the largest 25 Private Equity firms are headquartered in the US — with examples including TPG Capital (which owns and controls Ducati Motorcycles and Del Monte Foods), and Advent International (an early investor in Lululemon). Firms such as Blackstone, KKR, and Carlyle Group stood at the top end, with their funds raised over the past five years at $ 96 billion, 62 billion and 55 billion, respectively. At the mid and smaller end of the spectrum are companies such as Insight Partners, Francisco Partners, and Partners Group with their five-year funds raised standing at $ 23 b, $ 19 b, and $ 18 b, respectively.

State of Private Equity in 2020
Despite the expected drop in deal counts and money spent, the average deal size stood at ~$130 m in 2020, only a 7% drop from the previous year. The average fund size stood at ~910 m, a 4% decline from 2019. Moreover, 2020 has seen a significant drop in sell offs, with PEs reassessing their pre-pandemic exit strategies, and adopting a wait-and-see approach rather than take a haircut on their returns. US exits in 2020 stood at 782, compared to 1,107 in 2019. 

Impact of COVID-19 on Private Equity
COVID-19 has led to a surge in opportunistic deals driven by near term cash flow needs of businesses fostering immediate-term investing and rescue financing. Despite prevailing global economic uncertainty, Private Equity firms are adapting—trying to salvage and maintain adversely affected parts of their portfolios while searching for new opportunities that emerging trends could support.

Spotlight on healthcare and technology investments
Since 2009, PE investing in healthcare has outpaced broader PE deal activity as they often produce returns above the median. These deals have been driven by PEs seeking to capitalise on macro trends such as the aging global population, rise in per capita healthcare spending, etc. The onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic has led to continued proliferation of investments in healthcare.  
Over the past decade, tech-focused PE funds have outperformed non-tech buyouts and growth equity strategies in terms of returns. The COVID-19 pandemic has made investment in technology more attractive due its high growth prospects and resiliency in today’s context. 
Despite lower tech deal values and volumes compared to 2019, the US still holds a ~50% share of the PE technology deal value, totalling ~$ 134 b through 2020. As of the year end 2020, there were an estimated ~870 technology deals across key areas such as Software as a Service, cybersecurity, remote work technology, and automation.

Lessons to draw from Private Equity
PE growth fundamentals are centred on remaining dynamic in a continuously changing business environment, while maintaining profitability and mitigating risks. Although the PE landscape in Sri Lanka is still in its infancy, there are a number of lessons that any business can draw on: 
Define the full potential of opportunities but only pursue a handful of well thought out initiatives: PE firms are very selective of their strategies, and conduct a thorough assessment of all factors including demand, competition, and trends. The execution of their planned strategies is meticulously mapped out from beginning to end, and progress is regularly monitored through a few measurable indicators.
Prepare for all scenarios and “be risk diverse, not risk averse”: PEs prepare for all scenarios by building well-rounded investment portfolios, which enables them to remain profitable despite adverse macroeconomic conditions. For instance, Apollo Global Management has invested 40% of its capital in distressed companies with low valuations during downturns, including its acquisition of Expedia Group—an online booking business—during the pandemic to capitalise on the potential substantial gains in the future. 
Focus on broader themes to proactively capitalise on emerging trends: PE firms have pursued thematic approaches to investing, rather than limiting themselves to a particular company/sector. This involves identifying and selecting a few long-term themes to pursue based on strategic fit and building a portfolio around the theme. Benefits include having a better understanding of the types of deals to pursue and the size of the prize, a well-developed network of internal experts, and ability to create repeatable strategies to optimise results.

SYDNEY (Reuters): Chinese investment in Australia fell by 61% in 2020 to the lowest level recorded by the Australian National University in six years, coinciding with a worsening diplomatic dispute.
The annual tracking study from the university's East Asian Bureau of Economic Research recorded A$ 1 billion ($ 783 million) of Chinese investment in 2020, consisting of real estate (45%), mining (40%) and manufacturing (15%) deals.
The fall was larger than the 42% decrease in foreign direct investment globally measured by the United Nations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, said bureau director Shiro Armstrong.
“It reflects the effects of COVID but also more scrutiny of foreign investment by the Australian government, particularly that from China,” he said.
Australia announced a shakeup of its foreign investment laws in 2020 to give the government the power to veto, or force the sale of a business if it creates a national security risk.
Treasurer Josh Frydenburg said in June the national security test would be applied to telecommunications, energy and utilities firms, and businesses that collect data.
Chinese company Mengniu abandoned a deal to buy the Australia dairy firm Lion Dairy and Drinks from Japanese company Kirin in August, after the Australian government indicated it would block the sale.
The Chinese embassy said in November that 10 Chinese investments had been blocked in Australia on national security grounds, among a list of 14 grievances Beijing had about Australian government policy.
China has since imposed dumping tariffs on Australian wine and barley, and restricted the unloading of Australian coal at Chinese ports.
Chinese investment in Australia peaked at A$ 16.5 billion in 2016, spanning agriculture, transport, energy utilities, healthcare, mining and property, the ANU study showed.
By 2020, 86% of Chinese investment in Australia came from the Australian subsidiaries of Chinese companies.

Reuters: Gold jumped over 1% on Monday as a retreat in US Treasury yields pushed investors to bullion again as a refuge from inflation following the passage of a $ 1.9 trillion US stimulus package. 
Spot gold was up 0.5% to $ 1,742.30 per ounce at 1151 GMT, after rising as much as 1.5% to $ 1,759.53 earlier in the session. US gold futures rose 0.7% to $ 1,740.70 per ounce. 
“In today's trade, investors are simply scared of a rising inflation due to the stimulus, which will put an awful amount of liquidity in the market,” said StoneX analyst Rhona O'Connell. 
The US House of Representatives approved President Joe Biden's $ 1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill early on Saturday, sending it to the Senate for consideration. Gold dropped 3% on Friday, and recorded its biggest monthly decline since November 2016 in February due to a rise in US bond yields. Reversal of the higher yield trend helped gold, said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at financial services firm Axi. 
While gold is considered a shield against inflation, higher yields have of late threatened that status, since they translate into the higher opportunity cost of holding bullion, which pays no return. 
“In the short term we might see some confusion in the market; a weak dollar due to stimulus packages might help gold in the medium term. However, as the economy gains confidence and positive results come out of the vaccines, gold will face some headwinds,” StoneX's O'Connell said. 
On the technical front, the psychological $ 1,700 level is very significant, while the $ 1,760-1,765 range is an important hurdle for gold to rise further, Axi's Innes said.

Amãna Bank Chairman Asgi Akbarally


Amãna Bank CEO Mohamed Azmeer



Amãna Bank crossed the Rs. 100 billion mark in total assets as at YE2020, a milestone bearing evidence to its accelerated growth, which comes in a context where the bank has completed only nine years in banking operations. 
In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic related challenges, the bank has showcased strong resilience especially during the first three quarters of the year and has bounced back strongly in Q4 with a remarkable 51% growth in pre-tax profit recording Rs. 372.1 million in comparison to Rs. 246.2 million in Q4 2019. Post-tax profit for the same period stood at Rs. 213.3 million. 
In comparison to Q3 2020, the bank’s pre-tax and post-tax profits grew significantly by 168% and 167% respectively in Q4 2020. As a result of its resurgent Q4 performance, the bank, for the 12 months of 2020, reported Rs. 761.4 million as profit before tax and Rs. 463.7 million as profit after tax. It is noteworthy that the profit after tax of 2020 is higher than the Rs. 460.9 million reported in 2019.  
Maintaining a healthy financing margin of 3.7%, the bank’s net financing income grew 9% YoY to close at Rs. 3.45 billion, while achieving Rs. 1.13 billion during Q4 alone, demonstrating a growth of 53% against Q4 2019. Despite import control having an adverse impact on trade related fee income, the bank reported a net operating income of Rs. 3.72 billion for 2020.
Having successfully curtailed operating expenses, as a result of the continued focus on cost containment, the bank recorded an operating profit before VAT, NBT and DRL of Rs. 1.15 billion for 2020. The bank’s aggregate tax contribution of Rs. 691 million accounted for 60% of the bank’s operating profit before all taxes. 
Despite the backdrop of challenging market and economic conditions, the bank continued to maintain a strong growth momentum in customer deposits closing the year with a portfolio of Rs. 83.6 billion which reflected a significant YoY growth of 17%. This growth was achieved whilst also improving the bank’s CASA ratio from 39% in 2019 to 45% by end 2020, a testament to the strong emphasis the bank has placed throughout the year to promote its CASA proposition.
Despite subdued demand for credit, the bank recorded an 8% YoY growth in customer advances, surpassing the country’s private sector credit growth in 2020, to close the year at Rs. 62.6 billion. 
Amidst adverse market conditions, the bank’s continued focus on prudent portfolio management and timely customer engagement resulted in containing NPA well below the industry averages with Net NPA and Gross NPA ratios recording 1.4% and 4.0% respectively. Owing to the steady balance sheet growth and effective implementation of the Strategic Plan, the bank’s total assets grew by 16% YoY to close at Rs. 100.2 billion. 
As a result of its healthy financial profile, the bank continued its dividend journey consistently even through 2020, by paying out its third consecutive dividend, showing gratitude for the confidence of the bank’s shareholders. The payout was done in the form of a scrip dividend, in line with the CBSL directive which curtailed cash dividends of all banks. The bank’s total capital ratio stood at a healthy 17.4% as at 31 December 2020, well above the minimum requirements.
Along with the recalibration of Sri Lanka’s national rating scale by Fitch Ratings in June 2020, Amana Bank’s credit rating was revised upward from BB(lka) to BB+(lka) with a Stable Outlook. The rating was further reaffirmed in Fitch’s latest rating review in October 2020.
Commenting on the bank’s performance, Amãna Bank Chairman Asgi Akbarally said: “Despite the turbulent economic environment that we have all come to associate in the year 2020, Amãna Bank was able to record healthy results showcasing strong resilience, thanks to the underlying strengths of our business model, balance sheet and strong capital position. I am thankful to my fellow Board of Directors, recently retired Founder Chairman Osman Kassim and other retired directors, senior management and staff for their commitment and dedication to achieve this commendable performance. 
“I am also thankful to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for their swift and timely action in various aspects which resulted in timely relief to the public, valued support to revive affected SMEs, action to enhance the liquidity of banks, and many other positives which has guided and enabled us to steer through the challenges of 2020. 
“Despite the pandemic our efforts to the community did not cease. The OrphanCare project continued to make strong progress, as it made four rounds of fund disbursements in 2020, benefiting over 2800 orphans across the country, for which I am thankful to our independent Board of Trustees, donors and partners including our honorary auditors Ernst & Young along with other well-wishers for believing in our cause.”
Also sharing his comments on the bank’s performance Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer said: “I believe the pandemic presented an opportunity to demonstrate Amana Bank’s true purpose to support customers, businesses, communities and the nation at all times, which was well demonstrated by our engaged and energetic team, to whom I am really grateful. I am thankful to our directors, shareholders, customers, and valued collaborators, who have been a pivotal force in strengthening the foundation of our resilience. Equipped with such resilience, I believe that Amãna Bank is well poised to face the opportunities and challenges that comes with the 
year 2021.”

Many are aware that a major overhaul in taxation took place in relation to the taxation of individuals when the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 was introduced effective 1 April 2018.  The changes in the scope of taxation of individuals in the last few years is an interesting study. 
The tax liability of an individual depends on variable factors and fixed rules.  The variable factors that affect the tax liability of an individual are income earnings, amounts of deductible expenses, gains on disposal of assets, etc. The fixed rules one needs to be mindful are the Income Tax slabs, tax rates, tax free allowances now granted in the form of reliefs, rules pertaining to qualifying payments, exemptions, etc. In calculating the taxable income of an individual, expenses incurred subject to deductibility rules provided in the Act could be deducted by individuals other than individuals in employment.
This article attempts to focus on the transition of certain fixed rules (i.e. tax slabs, tax rates, tax free allowance/personal relief) in the last few years and the impact stemming from such changes.  

The fixed rules applied in Y/A 2017/18 stemming from IRA 2006
Under the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (IRA 2006), one may recall that the taxation of individuals could be classified broadly into three categories – employees, professionals in practice and self-employed/others. 
Each category experienced different tax treatments either by way of the tax slabs, tax rates or tax-free allowance and these had evolved over the years. If we consider the rules in the year 2017/18 which was the last year governed by the IRA 2006, the professionals in practice and individuals in employment were taxed at varied progressive rates but subject to the highest slab tax rate of 16%, while for others the highest slab tax rate was 24%. 
For comparative purposes if we consider a professional in practice and an individual in employment there was significant disparity in the application of the fixed rules. A person in employment enjoyed a tax-free allowance of Rs. 750,000 p.a. (including the general tax-free allowance of Rs 500,000) in Y/A 2017/18 and was taxed at the slabs of Rs. 500,000 at rates of 4%,8%,12% and 16%. Accordingly, a person in employment was taxed at the highest rate of 16% for income above Rs. 2.25 million a year.
A professional in practice enjoyed much more benefits based on the wider slabs provided in the Law. The tax-free allowance was Rs. 500,000. Thereafter the applicable rates for income up to Rs. 1 million (in Rs. 500,000 slabs) were 4% and 8%. The similarity in tax slabs ended there. The next slab was Rs. 24 million at 12% and next 10 million was taxable at 14%. Any income thereafter was subject to tax at the rate of 16%. Accordingly, a professional in practice would need to pay at the highest slab rate of 16% only if income exceeded Rs. 35.5 million. 
The individuals falling within the category of self-employed/other was entitled to a Rs. 500,000 tax free allowance and was subject to tax on Rs. 500,000 slabs at the progressive Income Tax rates of 4%,8%,12%,16%,20% and 24%.

Introduction of the new Income Tax Law in April 2018 
The Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 (IRA 2017) introduced with effect from 1 April 2018 introduced a framework of equal slabs and rates to all individuals. The personal relief (formerly known as tax free allowance) was Rs. 500,000 p.a. for all individuals (other than nonresident-non citizens) and an individual in employment was entitled to an additional employment relief of Rs. 700,000 p.a. 
Application of certain tax reliefs under the IRA 2017 varied as per the individual’s status of residency for Sri Lanka tax purposes. Income Tax at progressive rates from 4 to 24% was applied on tax slabs of Rs. 600,000 for all irrespective of whether they were employed, self-employed or professionals in practice. These changes had a major impact on the professionals in practice since the width of the slab was slashed drastically when compared to the laws under the IRA 2006. Hence one may concur that with the introduction of the 2017 Income Tax Act, equality prevailed in relation to the application of tax slabs and tax rates for all individuals. 

Proposals as per web notifications 
Thereafter from 1 January 2020 further tax changes were notified in relation to personal income tax via web notifications issued by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CGIR) where the Income Tax slabs were enhanced up to Rs. 3 million per annum and the tax rates were revised to 6, 12 and 18%. The personal relief was also increased to Rs. 3 million per annum and this applied to all individuals (other than a nonresident – non citizen). The employment relief is now embedded as part of the personal relief. So, from 1 April 2020 onwards any person who has income more than Rs. 3 million income will be subject to tax (if no exemptions apply) at the rate of 6%, more than Rs. 6 million at 12% and if more than Rs. 9 million they would be paying tax at the highest slab rate of 18%. 
One cannot deny that certain changes introduced such as the removal of final withholding status on interest, dividend and removal of senior citizens relief did impact severely on a certain cadre of taxpayers which warrants a separate study and maybe a subject for another article. 
The application of rules as dual regimes in Y/A 2019/20
The Year of Assessment 2019/20 where the extended time granted for filing of Return of Income falls on 28 February 2021 has the application of rules from dual regimes of Income Tax law. The tax computation for the Year of Assessment 2019/20 is indeed complex since it is a transition year and rules as per IRA 2017 as well as the rules proposed in the web notifications apply. For the nine months up to 31 December 2019 rules as per Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 would apply while for the three months from January to March 2020, the rules as per the web notifications issued by the Inland Revenue Department are followed. Hence the tax reliefs, tax slabs should be considered proportionately. 
In the last four years, the transition focus has been to gradually achieve a status where all individuals enjoy equal personal relief, tax slabs and tax rates. In addition, there are other reliefs such as rent relief, expenditure relief and qualifying payment reliefs also that one can enjoy. The Asian average for personal Income Tax is 28.67% (2020) while the global average is 31.16% (2020) as per the KPMG individual interactive tax rate tool. The individual tax rates of 6%,12% and 18% (progressive rates) are no doubt one of the lowest rates in the Asian region.  
There are many other areas in individual taxation such as exemptions, reliefs, qualifying payment reliefs granted which are not covered in this article as the focus is solely on the evolution of rules pertaining to Income Tax slabs, Income Tax rates and the tax-free allowance/ personal reliefs in the recent years across three regimes (i.e. IRA 2006, IRA 2017 and changes proposed via web notifications).

Achieves progress whilst continuing to support economic revival 








Chairman Gihan Cooray


 





CEO/Director Priyantha Talwatte



The Government and the Central Bank initiated various policy measures during 2020, aimed at triggering economic activities, ensuring livelihoods, and preserving the stability of the country’s financial
system. These policy measures included loan moratoriums, reduction of policy rates, lowering of the Statutory Reserve Requirement for licensed commercial banks, restriction on import of non-essential items, and various incentives to attract foreign funding sources into the domestic market.
Nations Trust Bank actively participated in providing working capital loans under the ‘Saubhagya’ scheme introduced by the Government and took proactive measures to extend necessary assistance to customers across all segments who required special attention. 
The bank recognised the importance of contributing to assisting adversely affected businesses with a view to supporting the revival of the national economy and rebuilding livelihoods. Towards this cause, the bank allocated Rs. 7 billion for 2020 of internally generated funds under the ‘Nations Diriya’ scheme dedicated to extending financial support to key industries, thereby enabling such businesses to recommence their business operations. 
Special payment relief schemes and special repayment plans for existing borrowers were also offered in addition to the Central Bank mandated moratorium schemes by lowering interest rates and charges on identified segments.
With banking being declared an essential service during the COVID-19 first wave, a concerted effort was made to keep branches across the network open in order to facilitate regular branch operations throughout the lockdown period. The bank operated 24x7 contact centre uninterrupted throughout this period, supporting all its client’s banking requirements.
During the pandemic, the bank strengthened its digital essentials in order to keep its customers constantly connected and facilitated all banking services digitally. The bank also supported cash to the doorstep services during the lockdowns. 
Digitisation and e-commerce being the way forward, the bank continued to invest in further strengthening the digital platforms designed with customer centrality. Whilst being socially responsible, the bank converted customer and brand communications from paper-based to e-based methods.
Despite the unprecedented circumstances followed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic, Nations Trust Bank Group demonstrated a resilient performance with a bottom-line growth of 9%. However, the net interest income fell short by 15% while the interest margins eroded by 80 bps due to the combined impact of the lower interest regime, interest rates ceilings imposed, and the concessionary interest rates granted on debt moratorium. 
The sluggish credit demand from the private sector and the selective lending approach adopted by the bank amidst the elevated credit risk prevalent in the market throughout the year led to a contraction in the loan book by 7% adding pressure on the interest income growth. Low yield on the excess liquid assets further impacted the overall margins.
Low level of economic activity and restricted hours of business operations during the pandemic had a sizable impact on the volume of fee-based transactions carried out by the bank during the year. Further, suspending or refunding of certain charges by the bank, considering the current difficulties faced by customers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, also negatively impacted the bank’s fee-based income resulting in a drop of 12.9% over last year. 
Cards income resulted in the highest drop of 26% with the drop in card spend due to changes in customer spending pattern owing to the pandemic. The restrictions on non-essential imports and an overall decline in exports caused a 7% drop in the trade fee. 
However, gains on trading forex increased as a result of forex funding swaps with the depreciation of the rupee during the current period in contrast to the appreciation experienced during the same period last year. The bank continued to benefit from the low-cost funding swaps compared to the cost of rupee deposits. The bank also benefited with trading profits on its’ fixed income securities portfolio with the drop in market rates resulting in an overall growth in Non-Fund-Based Income by 18% over last year despite the drop-in fee-based income.
The collection efforts were disrupted heavily due to the pandemic resulting in the non-performing loans ratio increasing to 7.2% compared to 6.2% reported last year. The bank made additional provisions on impairment for identified customer segments for possible cash flow delays based on available information and on certain risk elevated industries they operate in. With the cascading impacts of the aforementioned coupled with the downgrading of the country’s sovereign rating, the overall impairment provisions increased by 16.5 over last year. 
The operating expenses were curtailed by Rs. 968 million, a 9% saving over last year. Various cost-saving strategies and initiatives along with productivity, efficiency drives and focus on some of the large cost pools were the main reasons for the favourable variance. Accordingly, the cost to income ratio as of December 2020 improved to 46% compared to 48% achieved last year.
With the abolishment of the Debt Repayment Levy (DRL) and the Nation Building Tax (NBT) from January 2020 and December 2019, respectively, the effective tax rate dropped to 46% from 56% last year, and thereby the Group recorded a profit after tax of Rs. 4.05 billion compared to Rs. 3.71 billion in 2019.
The financial position of the group remained strong as its Tier I Capital and Total Capital Adequacy ratios as at 31 December 2020 stood well above the regulatory levels at 14.73% and 18.29%, respectively. The Statutory Liquid Asset Ratio (SLAR) for the Domestic Banking Unit and the Off‐Shore Banking Unit was at 38.79% and 30.75%, respectively, as at the year-end.
CEO/Director Priyantha Talwatte, commenting on the future, stated: “Despite the substantial headwinds, the bank will continue to support the Government’s initiatives in reviving the economy and safeguarding the livelihoods of our people. The Nations Trust team is fully committed to supporting our nation and all our clients navigate this period and come out strong into a post-pandemic era.  The bank is confident it has many endowments and capabilities to successfully navigate this period and serve all our stakeholders. The rollout of the vaccine and the careful opening of the country’s borders to tourists are welcome indicators of a gradual recovery. The bank is cautiously optimistic of prospects. We continue to be committed to serving our customers achieve their financial goals and aspirations in a sustainable manner.”

Headed by a well reputed and senior group of professionals as the Board of Directors along with the Chairman Sumith Cumaranatunga, Siyapatha Finance is known for its assurance of trust to its customers and the consistent resilience with which it tackles the hurdles faced by the organisation. 
Upholding values of loyalty, openness, trust, unity and service excellence, Siyapatha Finance strives to be the most innovative and trusted premier financial services provider. Siyapatha Finance similarly aims at providing flexible and creative solutions to customers, generating greater values for stakeholders, while assuring corporate governance through an empowered professional team, as their mission. 
Among their many services, the company is able to cater to the financial needs of any customer, in the areas of Vehicle Leasing, Gold Loan, Business Loan, Personal Loan, Fixed Deposits, Savings Accounts, Factoring and so on.

The above mentioned is achieved by geographical expansion through branch networking and market penetration. Siyapatha Finance possesses a strong Branch Network extending to each corner of the island including the North and the East, currently totalling 40 branches. In spite of the likely setbacks during the pandemic, Siyapatha Finance successfully developed and opened five new branches in Kohuwala, Nittambuwa, Malabe, Matale and Dambulla.

Tie up to expand fixed-price payments service and cost-effective currency exchange

Sokin, the new generation fintech payment firm, has signed a partnership agreement with Mastercard in South Asia to provide its fixed-price payment services in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal and the Maldives.  
Sokin is the only global payments provider that will provide a fixed-fee subscription-based payment service for fast and cost-effective currency exchange with no hidden charges. Mastercard’s global network and extensive reach in South Asia will allow millions of people to access Sokin’s instant payment network using Mastercard’s trusted and secure digital banking solutions and card services. 
The collaboration in South Asia follows announcements in November that Sokin will be a Mastercard principal member and card issuer for Singapore and that the two companies have forged a partnership in Europe and the United Kingdom.
“We see South Asia as a key market for Sokin, which is why we continue to build on our strong partnership with Mastercard to deliver our unique services to this region. We know that we have the products and the ambition to become the leading independent provider for South Asia, delivering the services and support people really want,” said Sokin CEO Vroon Modgill. 
Starting in June 2021, Sokin will offer consumers unlimited international money transfers and payments with no mark-up on transactions or hidden fees. Its proprietary technology makes the process easy – from the onboarding of customers to instant payments – all in its secure peer-to-peer mobile app.
 “Mastercard is delighted to support Sokin as it scales operations in South Asia, which is the largest inward remittance corridor globally,” said Mastercard South Asia Chief Operating Officer Vikas Varma. “Mastercard supports innovation and drives technological advances across the entire ecosystem. The combination of Mastercard’s trusted and secure solutions and Sokin’s innovative payment services will expand choice and convenience for consumers across South Asia.”

Invitees and the gathering at the event


Promotes cashless transactions across the country








SDB bank CEO and CBSL Working Group of Financial Institutions Chairman Thilak Piyadigama 




The third phase of CBSL›s ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ campaign unfolded in Galle on 21 February with the support of the island›s leading financial institutions and telcos. 
The ‹Rata Purama LANKAQR› initiative is an island-wide campaign commenced late last year to
introduce LANKAQR as the standard for mobile phone and digital payments countrywide, in moving towards a cashless and digitally-savvy society plus greater financial inclusion across Sri Lanka. 
Held at Court Square Galle Fort, the event was attended by Chief Guest Member of Parliament Chandima Weerakkody, top Central Bank officials, and representatives of participating financial institutions and telcos. 
The ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ initiative continues to be actively driven under the leadership of SDB bank CEO Thilak Piyadigama, who was appointed as the Chairman of the Working Group of Financial Institutions by CBSL to lead the implementation of the LANKAQR project islandwide.
The Galle leg of the LANKAQR national campaign, drawing on the participation of numerous high-profile guests plus the island’s top banks and financial institutions, aimed to advance the program’s overall vision of promoting digital transactions as the new norm and included city-wide promotions, covering major commercial locations in and around the city. 
Developed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, LANKAQR is a common Quick Response (QR) code standard, and its adoption by most major financial institutions in Sri Lanka is a progressive step on the path to Sri Lankans fully embracing a future that is inevitably digital, gradually leading to an entirely cashless mode of transaction. 
The LANKAQR system will allow banks, financial institutions and telcos, through their digital payment apps and platforms, to facilitate fast, secure and low cost digital payments to any merchant or service provider. 
LANKAQR provides customers with a mechanism for payment for all their needs ranging from groceries, healthcare to utilities, and even the purchase of goods from street-side vendors, directly from their bank account through the use of any LANKAQR-compliant mobile payment app.

Cargills Bank Managing Director and CEO Senarath Bandar

 




Fitch Ratings Sri Lanka has recently revised Cargills Bank’s National Long-Term Rating to AA-(lka) with a Stable outlook, from A+ (lka) with a Stable outlook. 
The Rating revision is following the recalibration of the agency’s Sri Lankan national rating scale following Fitch’s downgrade of the sovereign rating on 27 November 2020. The revision of the National Rating of Cargills Bank stems from the change in rating of its parent CT Holdings due to the recalibration of the national rating scale. This revision now places Cargills Bank on the same level as Sri Lanka’s leading and well-established banks. 
Cargills Bank Managing Director and CEO Senarath Bandara said: “At just six-years-old, we are a young bank. But by banking on the human spirit, we have made great strides in our short history. Through our hard work and honest, straightforward business style, we have garnered the respect of the public and built confidence amongst all business sectors. 
“Our main priority is to support the primary sectors of the Sri Lankan economy, with a strong focus on the agricultural sector and SMEs. This ties into our overall goal of becoming the most inclusive bank in Sri Lanka, while leveraging the support and resources available to us through the Cargills Group ecosystem. Achieving success and ensuring the best services possible has been exceedingly challenging in the post-COVID environment. 
“Thus, we are proud that with the support of our parent Cargills Group, we have received a rating of AA-(lka) with a Stable outlook from such a well-respected entity as Fitch Ratings Sri Lanka. We will continue to work to become the best and most inclusive bank in Sri Lanka.”
As the financial services arm of the Cargills Group, Cargills Bank was established in 2014 with a vision to be the most inclusive bank in Sri Lanka, utilising technology to harness the extensive Cargills ecosystem to provide holistic financial and market solutions to support agriculture and entrepreneur development in Sri Lanka. 
The bank has also embraced the Central Bank’s vision of a cashless society, being the first Financial Institution to issue and acquire LankaQR transactions in Sri Lanka, and facilitates technology-based payment solutions in Sri Lanka. Cargills Bank also enabled the acceptance of LankaQR payments at selected Cargills Food City outlets, making Cargills Food City the first supermarket in the country to accept LankaQR payments.
Cargills Bank provides a full range of banking and financial services. Customers may also access their Cargills Bank accounts through Cargills FoodCity outlets island-wide and enjoy free cash deposits and withdrawals at any Cargills FoodCity counter, courtesy of the Cargills Cash Service. 
Cargills Bank’s services include a full range of savings accounts, investment planner accounts, credit and debit cards, consumer loans, agriculture and micro financing, SME and business banking loan facilities and Trade facilities. 
The bank also provides a range of flexible and convenient digital banking services, ensuring 24/7 access and absolute convenience.

It was the largest non-bank listed debenture issue. 
The offer was for 75 million listed rated senior unsecured redeemable debentures at Rs. 100 each with an option to issue a further 25 million in the event of oversubscription of the original amount. The issue was assigned ‘[SL] A (stable)’ rating by ICRA Lanka. The issue included three types of debentures.
Type A was five-year tenor and offered 10.25% per annum payable annually and attracted 69 applications via bank drafts and cheques requesting for Rs. 309.39 million worth of debentures and 21 applications via RTGS, SLIPS. CFTS transfers requesting for 1.9 billion worth of debentures and three applications via bank guarantees requesting for Rs. 1.375 billion worth of debentures.

The proceeds of up to Rs. 7.5 billion raised from the initial issue of debentures will be utilised by the company to re-finance an equal amount of short term/money market borrowings obtained from the commercial banks in the country.
LOLC intends to replace short-term debt with medium-term debt at fixed interest rates in order to mitigate interest rate risk due to market volatilities. Settling these short-term loans and refinancing the same via medium-term funds will enable the company to minimise the reliance on financial institutions for the financing of the working capital requirements. 
The gearing ratio of the company prior to the issue was 1.66. This is expected to remain unchanged following the debenture issue.
Outstanding short-term loans and overdrafts as at 30 September 2020 amounts to Rs. 31.45 billion of which Rs. 7.5 billion will be settled through the funds raised via the initial issue of the debentures.
Accordingly, outstanding short-term loans and overdrafts post debenture issue will be Rs. 31.44 billion. 
The company intends to utilise the funds raised through the oversubscription option of Rs. 2.5 billion to settle short-term loans and bank overdrafts to the value of Rs. 2,500 million from the remaining pool of over Rs. 31.44 billion outstanding short-term loans. 
The specific short-term loans to be settled through the proceeds from the oversubscription option will be selected based on the interest rates of these facilities at the time of settlement. These loans can be settled at any time at the discretion of the company without any penalty charges.

Trade Finance and Investments PLC (TFI), a well-established financial service provider in Sri Lanka for over 35 years, has been amalgamated into one of Sri Lanka’s pioneering finance companies, Commercial Credit and Finance PLC (CCF).
The amalgamation, which came into effect from 31 December 2020 was subject to the shareholders of both companies approving the said amalgamation at Extraordinary General Meetings held on 09 November 2020. 
The amalgamation was driven by the financial sector consolidation plan initiated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in 2014, where CCF acquired majority control of TFI. Further to the request made by the CBSL, the Boards of Directors of both companies resolved to the amalgamation in line with the consolidation plan. The amalgamation would result in a combined asset base of approximately Rs. 90 billion with a strong asset-base with enhanced core capital ratios which provides CCF with a strong base for future growth.
Furthermore, with the inclusion of TFI’s two-wheeler and three-wheeler dominant loan portfolio into the CCF portfolio, which is also exposed to the same business line, the amalgamated company is expected to have market leadership in the two and three-wheeler lending segment in the country. 
The amalgamated entity will have a branch network of 126 locations enabling it to expand and fill in the network gaps within the CCF network and reach out to its customer base more efficiently with its range of products and high service standards.  
Commenting on the milestone, Commercial Credit Chief Operating Officer Rajiv Casie Chitty said, “The amalgamation is best-suited in keeping with Commercial Credit and Finance PLC’s progressive stance in order to serve our customer base better in fulfilling their dream for a brighter future. This will enable us to penetrate into Trade Finance and Investments’ current geographical locations covered by its branch network and gain leverage on its strengths, while introducing Commercial Credit and Finance’s broader product portfolio in these locations thereby strengthening the asset-base for the betterment of all stake-holders of both entities.”

DFCC Bank Vice President/Head of Card Centre Denver Lewis highlighting the use of Lanka QR to simplify a distribution operation as the QR code could be shared with customers and obtain payments upfront

Minister Chandima Weerakkody making a purchase using the DFCC Pay App
 
 
DFCC, the bank for everyone, recently participated in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL) RataPurama QR promotional event, held in the southern economic hub of Galle. 
The decision by DFCC to maintain a presence at this event comes after the recent success of DFCC’s promotional campaign held at the Narahenpita Economic Centre with the goal of promoting QR payments under the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s Rata Puraama Quick Response initiative. 
Due to the fact that this event’s objective was to promote the national level interest of bringing Sri Lanka into a cashless future, Minister Chandima Weerakkody, CBSL Governor Prof. W.D. Lakshman and CBSL Director Payments Dharmasri Kumaratunge attended the occasion as the Chief Guests. Representatives present from DFCC were Vice President (Cards) Denver Lewis and Southern Regional Manager Pradeep Alwis.
DFCC’s stall caught the attention of many invitees and participants and as a result, countless successful cashless transactions were conducted. This was further driven by the presence of displayed products from Narangoda Group, a prominent dealer for LAUGFS Gas and Hemara Rich Look, a leading clothing store in Galle.
Additionally, DFCC was also able to build increased awareness and usage of the DFCC Pay App that enables QR code transactions - numerous vendors and customers were able to gain insight into the convenience of using a QR-based payment method via DFCC Pay App. As a result, new QR Merchants from the area were onboarded and subsequently promoted QR Payments to their customers. 
DFCC is no stranger to the benefits of enabling their customers to use QR-based paymentmethods. The launch of DFCC’s Pay App in January 2019 resulted in the bank becoming among the first financial institutions to be certified for the LANKAQR standard which is now accepted as the national common QR.
The trailblazing Pay App permits customers to make retail payments using smart mobile devices through funds available in their current or savings account to the merchant’s account directly. The DFCC Pay App provides a convenient, secure and affordable option for making retail payments which is otherwise primarily made by cash. 
Similarly, the DFCC Pay Merchant App can be used by all types of merchants in the countryfrom large corporates, SMEs to wayside vendors, while QRMerchants can accept payments even with the use of a basic feature phone as the paymentconfirmation can be sent as an SMS Alert. As an unwavering partner in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s efforts to reduce the usage of physical cash by Quick Response (QR) initiative, DFCC has assumed an active role in supporting the CBSL’s vision of building a cashless future. By continuing to leverage the use of advancements in technology and digitalisation, it is expected that the shared values of DFCC and the CBSL will result in an even faster adoption of QR technology among the general public.

Chief Guest CBSL Governor Deshamanya Prof. W.D. Lakshman speaking at the event

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) expanded its pioneering ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ initiative in the Galle District with a promotional campaign organised by HNB PLC with the participation of 21 leading financial institutions and telecommunication partners in the country. 
The Galle-leg of the national campaign, hosted by HNB PLC at the Magistrate Square, will be the third phase of the island-wide initiative of ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ to introduce LANKAQR as the standard for mobile phone payment apps and digital payments across the island, moving towards a cashless and digitally-savvy society with greater financial inclusion.
“We have successfully introduced a convenient, safe and secure mode of payment for merchants and consumers and we are delighted to see a substantial number of conversions to LANKAQR since its launch last year. The digitalisation of payment solutions in Sri Lanka in this manner has ensured the continuity of business activities and development of not just the financial sector but also the economy at large, despite the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“As such, we are delighted to witness a significant number of small and medium enterprises and consumers using the technology in their day to day activities. If the digitalisation of payment solutions continue we will be able to significantly reduce the amount we spend on printing currency and ensure we face the challenges brought on by the pandemic head on,” CBSL Governor Deshamanya Prof. W.D. Lakshman said. 
The campaign was attended by several high profile guests and top banks and financial institutions to advance the program’s overall vision of promoting digital transactions as the new norm, and included city-wide promotions covering major commercial locations in and around the city. Following the ceremony, several merchants in Galle were presented with the LANKAQR code by CBSL Director - Payments and Settlements Dharmasri Kumaratunge to conduct transactions. 
As LANKAQR is a common Quick Response (QR) code standard introduced together with licensed financial institutions and Lankaclear Ltd. by the CBSL, merchants will no longer need multiple QR codes for different platforms. Users can make payments via LANKA QR by scanning the code using any digital payment app connected to LANKAQR. Upon completion, merchants will receive an instant SMS notification, confirming the receipt of payment.
Since the launch of the campaign last year, 160,000 merchants across the country have adopted LANKAQR, a faster assimilation to the system compared to the cards industry which took over 30 years to connect 85,000 POS terminals.
The LANKAQR enables banks, financial institutions and telcos to facilitate fast, secure and low-cost digital payments to any merchant or service provider through their digital payment apps and platforms. It also provides customers with a payment mechanism directly from their bank account through the use of any LANKAQR-compliant mobile payment app for all their needs ranging from groceries, healthcare to utilities, and even the purchase of goods from street-side vendors.
HNB hosted the campaign under the patronage of Chief Guest CBSL Governor Deshamanya Prof. W.D. Lakshman, Guest of Honour Member of Parliament Chandima Weerakkody, Southern Province DIG Rohan Silva, CBSL-appointed LANKA QR Committee Chairman and SDB Bank CEO Thilak Piyadigama, and CBSL Director - Payments and Settlements Dharmasri Kumaratunge, together with senior officials from the banks, including HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles and HNB Deputy General Manager - Retail and SME Banking Sanjay Wijemanne. 
The adoption of LANKAQR by most major financial institutions in Sri Lanka is a progressive step on the path to Sri Lankans fully embracing a future that is inevitably digital, gradually leading to an entirely cashless future of transaction.

Meanwhile, the bank’s Operating Profit Before Taxes on Financial Services increased by 4%, reflecting excellence in core banking performance and the success of cost containment measures, despite the bank’s fee-based income declining sharply due to reduced business volumes resulting from disruptions caused by COVID-19 pandemic and waiver of fees and charges mandated by the regulator.

The bank’s net interest margins improved from 4.36% to 4.41% during the year which a commendable feat, given the fact that the bank recognising the entire loan modification loss from COVID 19 loan moratoriums under interest income and the industry-wide deterioration in credit quality.

However, the bank’s net non-performing loan ratio improved from 2.82% to 2.34% due to prudent provisioning.
Commenting on the financial performance, the bank’s Director/CEO Nimal Tillekeratne said: “The bank was able to record this exceptional performance due to proactive decisions and effective execution of strategies capitalising on the opportunities in the macroeconomy while managing the risks. This impressive performance reflects the bank’s resiliency, foresight, agility, and the growing capability to generate strong financial performance even amidst challenging conditions.”

150,000 new ePassbook app downloads in 6 months

 
New app downloads of Commercial Bank of Ceylon’s ePassbook has increased by 150,000 in just six months after self-registration was permitted via a recent upgrade, Sri Lanka’s largest private bank reports. 
The first digital passbook in Sri Lanka’s and South Asia’s banking industry, ComBank ePassbook has users in more than 100 countries who now log in at the rate of 20 per second, averaging more than 1,000 active users per minute, and has over one million customer registrations, the Bank said.
The ground-breaking app was upgraded recently with features including self-registration for personal accounts, real-time transaction notifications, and a biometric login feature that enables account holders to use the app via face ID and fingerprint, all of which significantly improved accessibility, versatility and security, enhancing user-autonomy and convenience.
The newly introduced self-registration option which is the main catalyst for the spike in downloads of the app is especially advantageous as it eliminates the need for account holders to visit their respective branches to activate the app. Another simultaneous upgrade made it possible for users to self-add, remove, or group Current Accounts, Savings Accounts, and Credit Cards in their ComBank ePassbook mobile application.
Future enhancements to the app will include the possibility of viewing unlimited transaction history, including unrealised cheques, account holds and the total overdraft limit for current accounts.

The app provides access to details of savings, current, NRFC, RFC accounts, and Credit Cards on Android with Google Play and iOS powered mobile devices and acts as a single repository for multiple accounts enrolled by an account holder, with the capability to view each account separately. 
Users of the app may also label different accounts with preferred names or codes such as salary, petty cash, savings, entertainment and such, for easy reference. 
At present the app enables account holders to track account balances and transactions of the past 30 days in real-time on their mobile phones or tabs from anywhere. The ComBank ePassbook app updates automatically whenever the user is online, the bank said.

Further advancing its continuous program of digital transformation, SDB bank is set to introduce an all-new paperless onboarding process in mid-February. 
This follows the bank’s implementation of a lean, e-signature system for customer loan agreements in late-2020.
SDB bank’s paperless customer onboarding effort will replace their current customer onboarding process which is fully paper-based. The use of digital technology in this key process across the bank’s 94 branches island-wide promises a host of new benefits to their extensive personal customer base, proudly covering people belonging to all walks of life with both small-scale entrepreneurial and personal finance requirements. 
The initiative will afford numerous conveniences and create an improved experience for both customers and staff. The integration of digital technology into the customer onboarding process is parallelly set to enhance efficiency across the bank, improve accuracy of data, offer greater internal controls, plus reduce the cost per customer. 
Each of these advantages to the bank, as part of their digitalization of internal processes, will allow them to facilitate a smooth, modern onboarding experience for all their customers, regardless of where they may be. Whether out in the paddy field, at a construction site, a factory, or anywhere else, the facility allows for anytime, anywhere convenient customer onboarding without the requirement of the customer’s physical presence at the bank. This further strengthens the bank’s reputation as a provider of world-class banking facilities not only in city locales and to high-net-worth individuals, but equally to out-of-Colombo, low- and middle-income customers. 
As such, SDB bank’s paperless onboarding system is expected to boost personal banking numbers in far-off locales along with signing on of customers displaying small-scale entrepreneurial needs in these areas, ensuring they are connected to the national economy and offering numerous banking conveniences to uplift their entrepreneurial efforts.
Through their emphasis on digital innovation across both internal and external aspects of their banking operation, SDB bank has continued to gain recognition as a digital pacesetter in local banking and a key facilitator of national development, particularly through the modern banking conveniences offered to small-scale entrepreneurs in uplifting the national economy.

LONDON (Reuters): Retail investors should avoid using unverified information from social media to buy and sell stocks, the European Union’s markets watchdog said yesterday.
Retail investors following the Reddit forum WallStreetBets in the US piled into GameStop Corp last month, sending shares in the retailer rocketing at the expense of prominent investors who had bet against the stock, ringing alarm bells in Europe.
Although market rules and structures are different in the EU, it cannot be ruled out that similar circumstances may occur in the bloc as well, the European Securities and Markets Authority said in a statement. There are already signs that more retail investors are piling into European stock markets.
ESMA said increased participation of retail investors in Europe is helping to deepen the EU’s capital market, but they face significant risks when buying shares that are very volatile, the watchdog said.
Investors should first gather information from reliable sources and know how much losses they can bear, ESMA said.
Organising or executing coordinated strategies to trade or place orders at certain conditions and times to move a share’s price could constitute market manipulation, ESMA said.
“Similarly, special care should be taken when posting information on social media about an issuer or a financial instrument, as disseminating false or misleading information may also be market manipulation,” it said.
Care should be taken when disseminating investment recommendations, including via social media and online platforms, as they are subject to regulatory requirements, ESMA added.

BOC SDGM (HR) K.E.D. Sumanasiri 

 
 




Persisting with the purpose-designed HR plans BOC implemented at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the bank has managed to ensure a safe and dynamic environment for the successful mobilisation of staff plus continuous provision of services, despite ongoing restrictions and safety concerns. 
In managing the early part of the pandemic, BOC’s HR function proactively engaged all employees, drawing on a novel method of delegation, seeing that it would be the most effective and efficient way forward in handling an unprecedented situation posing similarly unseen challenges. This draws from BOC’s culture of smart delegation, a core component of its HRM and operational philosophy. 
To mobilise a team exceeding 8,000 staff members in the initial months of the global pandemic, required the bank’s HR department to give trust and confidence, to all employees across the organisation in their capabilities and decision-making power. The system of delegation adopted was driven by this empowering of staff, where managers and employees at every level were instructed to take decisions in their respective positions, using their discretion to act and delegate as necessary. 
BOC adopted a two-tiered strategy, where the primary objective included the protection of all employees, and secondly ensuring business would go on as normal even with the restrictions. Therein, employee adherence to all Health Department enforced regulations and orders remained a key HR goal, complemented by its own initiatives to drive employee safety and continuity of operations.  
The bank continues to bear all costs for quarantine procedures and PCR tests to be performed by employees. Apart from essentials such as providing PPE for all employees, BOC also adopted a roster system and offered free transport, to ensure its 8,000 strong staff have been able to progressively resume work. 
Accounting for the many impacts of COVID-19 on the bank’s HRM function, BOC has adopted numerous changes in its delivery of HR services including digitalisation. From unique methods of showing appreciation to employees in overcoming challenges to meeting in person, remote hiring and recruitment with video platform-based interviews to save time and ensure safety, to restructuring of time-off policies and leave to reflect government provided guidelines, the bank’s HRM department has been keen to create an environment conducive to high-impact work and growth. 
Towards this end, BOC has afforded much focus to ensuring a strong work-life balance for employees, in line with the increased need for work-from-home and flexible work arrangements organization-wide.  
While affording employees numerous freedoms and demonstrating to them that the organization truly cares for their safety and wellbeing, which has led to many staff members volunteering to work at their respective branches and offices, the bank has given continuous importance to its unique HR culture and history. 
With the HRM outlook the bank has carefully tailored over several decades, the core focus has been keeping employees happy and nurturing an environment for them to prosper, parallelly implementing safeguards for proper discipline, while continuously tending to their future security. 
BOC’s HR culture of closely understanding people and their problems, plus offering continuous skill, career and life development opportunities, is closely complemented by their attention to place-appropriate HRM. 
The notion that HR and HRM differ widely based on the institution where it is being applied, has been a key component of the human resources approach of BOC from very early in their progression. Staying true to HR fundamentals, the bank, operating as a State bank first and foremost, understood that they had to align their HR principles with their primary objectives. 
With a focus on eradicating financial issues at the ground level and uplifting the economy therein, the bank though liberal in their approach to HR, recognised that certain HR freedoms could not be afforded to their employees, as issues of resource misuse may occur otherwise. 
A major part of their unique HR outlook therefore involves recruiting and nurturing employees who understand these principles strongly. The bank actively attempts to develop value-added employees who progress in their careers while serving the bank and its overall vision. 
Towards this end, BOC affords greater importance to discipline and behaviour, which services primarily as a protective mechanism to ensure continued employee betterment and safety, while also protecting the bank’s image and offering confidence to customers in our trustworthiness and dedication to them. 
BOC’s HR function’s emphasis on tending to and improving employee health across six aspects, from physical, mental, social, emotional, and spiritual, to economic health, represents a novel approach to employee wellbeing and career motivation, driven by numerous dedicated programs. 
In a unique stance, despite the growing trend of digitalisation to streamline repeat HR processes and tasks, even within the BOC setup, the bank emphasises on the need for the human touch in HR. It is what lends the all-essential organisational component of human capital, now being actively pushed worldwide as a quantifiable contributor to business success, humanness. This actively reflects BOC’s HR outlook, which has allowed it to successfully manage the ongoing pandemic and continue its human plus employee-first approach.

Awarded highest eco-friendly rating by Green Building Council of Sri Lanka


The heritage building which is home to the Galle Fort branch of the Commercial Bank of Ceylon has won a Platinum award from the Green Building Council of Sri Lanka (GBCSL) for its eco-friendly features after it was recently restored to its original grandeur by the Bank. 
The Platinum award is the highest rating achievable based on a set of performance standards used to certify the operations and maintenance of a building. Key aspects taken into consideration by the GBCSL to bestow this rating on a commercial or institutional building includes management, sustainable sites, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, innovation and design process, and social and cultural awareness. 
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon ticked all the boxes when it undertook the renovation of this building, built in the early 19th century, which came into the Bank’s possession in 1973 when the Bank acquired three branches of the Mercantile Bank of India (MBI). Pivotal features of a Green Building, such as energy efficiency and renewable energy, water efficiency, environmentally preferable building materials and specifications, waste reduction, toxics reduction, indoor air quality, smart growth and sustainable development were focused on during the restoration. 
The building consists of the Commercial Bank’s Galle Fort Bank branch, the Bank’s Regional Office and a holiday home. It also houses a mini museum containing archives and items used since the inception of the branch, which has now become a popular tourist attraction.
The Platinum Rating was accorded to the building for the restoration process that included the recycling of all imperishable material in an environmentally friendly manner, using only locally sourced, specified Green rated raw material in the renovation, disposal of debris in compliance with the Department of Archeology and the Galle Heritage Foundation, installing a 15kW rooftop solar energy generation system, installation of a rain water harvesting system and ecofriendly food recyclers for all meal rooms, and the fitting of a fire protection system, back-up generator, energy efficient Variable Flow Refrigerant (VFR) air conditioning system, and an LED lighting and electrical system to complement the state-of-the-art banking operations of the branch.
The building has achieved 45% energy saving compared to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standard baseline and consumes minimal portable water with the use of a tube well and a pump powered by solar energy, the harvesting of rainwater, and the installation of efficient sanitary fittings.  
Furthermore, in adherence to the Bank’s green agenda, the mechanically ventilated areas of the building are fitted with energy-efficient air conditioners and the carbon dioxide levels of office area are continuously measured to maintain a healthy indoor environment for its occupants. 
The building’s refurbishment was carried out in consultation with the Galle Heritage Foundation, the Department of Archeology, the Galle Municipal Council and the Urban Development Authority, preserving the old structure wherever possible. 
Commenting on the renovation that earned the building the GBCSL Platinum Rating, Commercial Bank Assistant General Manager – Services Chinthaka Dharmasena said: “Sustainability is one of the key pillars of the Bank’s corporate agenda, while the preservation of heritage sites and traditions is one of the causes we support through our CSR Trust. Both these aspects were addressed in the renovation of our Galle Fort branch as one of the initiatives to celebrate our centenary year in 2020.”
Commercial Bank was also presented the ‘Excellent Green Commitment Award’ for the Banking Sector in 2019 by the GBCSL for its leadership in multifaceted Green initiatives encompassing lending to support eco-friendly operations, migrating customers to paperless banking, reducing consumption of non-renewable energy, water and other resources in its own operations, and support to community initiatives that help conserve habitats and the environment.
The Green Building Council of Sri Lanka is a consensus-based not-for-profit organisation with diverse and integrated representation from all sectors of the property industry and academia. Established in 2009 as a joint effort of the professional institutions of architects, engineers, structural engineers, town planners, quantity surveyors, university academics, construction industry leaders, environmentalists and business leaders, the organisation’s aim is to transform the Sri Lankan construction industry with green building practices and to encourage it to fully adopt sustainability as the means by which the environment thrives, the economy prospers and society grows.
The first Sri Lankan bank to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World and the only Sri Lankan bank to be so listed for 10 years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 268 branches and 887 ATMs in Sri Lanka.
Commercial Bank’s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets; Myanmar, where it has a Microfinance company in Nay Pyi Taw; and the Maldives, where the Bank has a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake.

Fitch Ratings views most rated Sri Lankan corporates as less vulnerable than local financial institutions to the sovereign’s financial distress. This is because most rated corporates have a combination of strong business profiles, low leverage, sound liquidity, and limited exposure to Government. 
On the other hand, local financial institutions’ ratings are usually constrained by the sovereign rating due to the strong correlation with the sovereign’s credit profile, as reflected in high exposure to Government securities, the wider domestic economy, and local financial markets.
National ratings of most corporates are now grouped at the upper end of the Sri Lanka national rating scale following the scale’s recalibration, which followed the downgrade of the sovereign rating to ‘CCC’ from ‘B-‘ in November 2020.
In a stressed environment that follows a sovereign default in particular, we believe stronger corporates (that are not linked to the sovereign) with sufficient on-balance sheet liquidity can weather some period of financial market stress, although accessibility to external capital may be limited (but not completely shut out) and may come at a high cost. 
Most Fitch-rated corporates at ‘AA(lka)’ or above benefit from strong business profiles, and we therefore expect they will continue to be able to access local bank funding in a hypothetical stress scenario that follows a sovereign default.
Furthermore, corporates rated ‘AA+(lka)’ and ‘AAA(lka)’ have low leverage and solid liquidity which act as buffers against a prolonged deterioration in operating cash flows in the event revenues fall. Some issuers benefit from a degree of support from stronger shareholders based overseas, which is not affected by challenges in the domestic economic environment.

International Credit Rating Agency assigns this rating to schemes that have an adequate degree of safety regarding timely receipt of payments from the investments that they have made
Rating is based on JB Vantage Money Market Fund’s portfolio with the credit score being comfortable at the assigned rating level







JB Financial CEO and Fund Manager of the JBMMF Christine Dias Bandaranaike 

 
 




JB Financial Ltd., a specialist asset manager, investing in a range of investment grade debt instruments, equity and gilt-edged securities received a credit risk rating of [SL]A+mfs (pronounced as Sri Lanka A plus m f s) for its JB Vantage Money Market Fund (JBMMF) recently from ICRA Lanka Ltd. 
The fund is the second largest Money Market Fund in terms of assets under management (AUM) in Sri Lanka with Rs.18.82 billion as at December 2020. The fund was initiated on 4 August 2011 and has been in existence for nearly a decade consistently outperforming the benchmark (NDBIB CRISIL 91-day T-bill Index).
Deutsche Bank AG acts as the trustee of the JBMMF, and ensures that the fund manager operates according to the investment mandate to achieve the goals and objectives while safeguarding investors’ interests. 
The fund is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission on a regular basis to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The JBMMF has been a consistent winner at the CFA Capital Market Awards for best unit trust, winning the Gold award in 2016 and 2017 and the Bronze in 2018 and 2019.  
Speaking on the rating, Christine Dias Bandaranaike (CFA), CEO of JB Financial and Fund Manager of the JBMMF, said, “The rating reflects our solid position as a leading specialist investment manager. We have over the past few years grown the Fund’s AUM while maintaining a robust risk management framework and sound financial metrics in line with the investment mandate. The rating further signifies the relative prudence of the fund which only invests in companies which are willing to subject themselves to an external rating and are therefore transparent with their financials. As part of our investment mandate, we only invest in companies that are considered Investment Grade, that is rated BBB- and higher by an external rating agency. Investments in the BBB rated category is further restricted up to an average of 30%, while the remaining is invested in A rated and above companies in order to manage and mitigate credit risk more prudentially.”
She added, “In times of very low-interest rates as we are experiencing now, we provide investors a more lucrative alternative to traditional financial instruments such as bank and non-bank fixed deposits. The JBMMF provides investors with a higher yield than a traditional fixed deposit with the flexibility to redeem or withdraw investments as and when needed without a commitment period or a penalty.” 
The JBMMF yielded annualised returns of 11.79% for the past five years, 12.22% for the past three years and 11.41% for the past one year as of December 2020. 
JB Financial is the only Sri Lankan fund management company that is compliant with both the Asset Manager Code (AMC) and the Global Investment Performance Standard (GIPS). The Company claims compliance since 2016 and recently updated to the latest GIPS 2020 standards as well, conforming to ethical, professional and fair representation of investor performance. 
ICRA Lanka Ltd. (ICRA Lanka) is a fully owned subsidiary of ICRA Limited (ICRA) of India and is licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC). The ultimate parent company of the international Credit Rating Agency, Moody’s Investors Service, is ICRA’s indirect majority shareholder. The rating is awarded based on the expertise of the parent company driven by a rating committee comprising experienced senior executives from ICRA for a period of one year.

Today the global payment system has gradually shifted to an electronic payment system where telecommunication systems, banking systems and business sectors globally have united to harness the benefits of this payment system

During the last couple of months I noticed that there were a number of advertisements sponsored by Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) both in print and electronic media to inculcate the general public about the enormous benefits one can gain through cashless transactions and the agony one has to endure when using cash for transactions. In other words, it encourages simply not to use cash/money/currency but to use plastic cards either credit or debit or smart and ATM (Automated Teller Machine) cards when making financial transactions. 
Today the global payment system has gradually shifted to an electronic payment system where telecommunication systems, banking systems and business sectors globally have united to harness the benefits of this payment system. Providing the enormous benefits of cashless transactions, mainly the debit cards and credit cards among others are playing a crucial role and despite the red signals issued by some segments of society in respect of the security and loss of privacy, customers continue to use these cards rapidly. Consequently at present globally financial institutions and business organisations, both private and public, work together to exploit this opportunity using the rapidly-developing innovative technology.
 
Evolution of the e-payment system
As reported the first ATM which facilitates customers to use a plastic card known as debit or credit or ATM card to effect a financial transaction was introduced in the Enfield Town Branch of Barclay’s Bank in the UK in 1967. Gradually but within a very short period, the services rendered by ATM have been trendy and secured a presence in every populated corner in the world. Objectively in the earlier phase, banks installed the ATMs inside of and outside close to the branch. However this trend has been changed now to locate the ATMs in high traffic areas like shopping centres, grocery stores, bus stands, railway stations, airports, service stations, hospitals, main junctions and other public convenient places.
When these plastic cards to effect a financial transaction are used, in order to secure the transaction, each customer has been given a confidential Personal Identification Number or PIN. Many cards have a chip to transact the data from the card to the machine. These work in the same way as a bar code that is scanned by a code reader.
No doubt this is a radical shift but to Sri Lanka, it is still in the beginning. In Sri Lanka, if my recollection is correct, the first ATM was introduced by Sampath Bank in 1986 and today every bank in the country operates its own ATMs.
With the expectation of harnessing the benefits of this move and to improve the operational efficiencies, banks and a few Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs) in Sri Lanka have now invested heavily in advanced digital platforms. Banks and the NBFIs which do not possess healthy balance sheets are also now compelled to invest in such platforms for them to survive in the market, though it involves high cost. 
The new apps introduced by banks and a few NBFIs in Sri Lanka in the recent past allow customers to perform self-service transactions such as to make withdrawals, deposits, bill payments and transfer funds within the bank known as intra bank transactions or with another bank known as inter bank transactions, electronically. Besides, the customers are advantaged to purchase goods and services online by paying the vendors using an electronic payment system which is popularly known as e-commerce payment system or online payment system.
Reducing the transaction and personnel cost and also the paper work, this electronic payment system has revolutionised the payment process which is user-friendly and consumes less time than manual processed payment system.
In the meantime the outbreak of the corona pandemic has also considerably contributed towards the acceleration of this move. The COVID-19 directives to maintain a physical distance has compelled a significant number of people in Sri Lanka to use these electronic cards to affect their cash transactions. 
 
Different types of e-payment systems
In a nutshell e- payment methods which are being used in Sri Lanka are as follows.
Credit card and debit cards:  Though no need to elucidate the most popular forms of payment for e-commerce transactions are credit cards and debit cards which are very simple to use. 
Smart card which also a type of plastic card in which the personal data of the customer embedded and stored in it. The customer can load the card with funds and effect the payments or settle a bill. Here the special feature is that needs to be re-loaded since the money loaded reduces with the usage.
E-wallet is also another method of e-payment in which the customer has a registered and created E- wallet profile. It is a prepaid account which allows the customer to store multiple credit cards, debit cards and bank account numbers in a secured environment.  The important feature here is the customer needs not to key the required information every time when making payments.
Internet banking:  This has now become a very popular e-payment method in the country. Here the advantage is the customer can pay for online purchases directly from the bank account.  Interbank and intra bank fund transfers as well as bill payments, credit card payments are also can be made through this payment method. For internet banking no plastic cards are used but the customer needs to register with a preferred bank in order to avail this facility. 
Mobile payment: This is a latest development where online payments can be made through a smart mobile phone. When the customer makes a payment request to the related service provider through a text message the customer’s mobile account is charged with the payment and it will be added to the monthly phone bill for settlement. Just by downloading the app from a preferred service provider’s website and linking the information related to credit card or mobile billing, any customer can easily setup this mobile payment system.
 
Benefits for banks and NBFIs than the customers
No need to elaborate that the above briefed e- payment services which are being used by customers to make financial transactions are more beneficial to the respective banks and NBFIs than the customers.
 
What made me to say so?
Just imagine; In the case of a manual processed payment system, when a customer enters into a bank branch to make a withdrawal, he/she needs to duly complete a standard payment instrument (withdrawal-form or a cheque) introduced by the respective bank. This payment instrument (PI) has to be tendered to the teller/cashier of the cash counter who in turn needs to verify the accuracy of the PI in order to ensure that it has been accurately completed and signed by the customer. Customers’ identity has to be verified; signature has to be checked to ensure whether it tallies with the given specimen signature, etc. After verification of the balance in the account, the PI has to be authenticated by the cashier or by an authorised officer. Equally whenever a customer tenders a PI to obtain cash, a temporary number which is known as Token Number has to be issued for the easy identification of the correct customer who tendered the relevant PI.
Once the approval is granted for the PI, the cashier has to call-out the token number signalling to appear the respective customer in front of the cashier to obtain the requested amount of cash. Thereafter the cashier has to prepare the cash and count it using the cash counting machine in front of the customer. After the accuracy of the amount is ensured the so counted cash have to be given to the customer obtaining his/her signature again as an acknowledgement. 
This entire process including printing of the PIs is a cost to the bank and time consuming. Effective man hours and time are wasted. On the other hand the customer too has to waste his/her effective time since this process is such long and time consuming. This simple illustration indicates the wearisome activities both bank and the customer to endure whenever a traditional payment is made. In the case of making a deposit, bill payment and fund transfers the process to be encountered is almost similar or worse. 
All these discomfitures could be effectively and efficiently managed as a result of properly inculcating and providing facilities to the customers to transact electronically. Not only the discomfiture but also the cashless payment wipes out the danger of fake-notes almost completely and also it shrinks the dread of cash robbery.
These are the objectives of the above said “avoid Cash agony’ advertisements. In order to successfully accomplish this objective, whether the banks, NBFIs and business organisations in Sri Lanka are doing the most appropriate things, to persuade and attract the customers, is an issue which needs to be addressed.  
 
Cumbersome process
When a card is to be issued the banks require the customer to provide information. Generally, most of the above said cards are issued to an existing bank customer who maintains an account. At the time of establishing the relationship or opening the account, a prospective customer provides almost all the details that are repeatedly required by the bank at the time of issuing a card. Since already the details are available in the bank, why can’t the bank to issue a card as an additional facility without annoying the customer requesting to provide the information which is already there in the bank?
In most cases the bank asks to provide the details of either the mother or father of the card applicant. In the case of a mother the name prior to the marriage is also considered necessary. Can any bank is in a position to reveal that by using the applicant’s mother’s name prior to the marriage has helped such banks to detect frauds and curtail frauds? Frauds reported versus number of cards being used are very minimal and negligible. 
It is amazing, at the request of the bank when a customer needs to obtain a chip embedded card instead of a chip-less card which is being used, it is compulsory to provide all these details which are already there in the bank.
Why cannot banks simplify this process if they want to harness the benefits of e-payment methods? It shows that though the systems and processes are digitalised, the workforce is mentally living in the traditional payment methods and not transformed themselves as moderated thinkers. Doesn’t this annoy the customer and discouraging him/her than encouraging for e-payment methods?
Whenever an issued card is lost a new card needs to be obtained. It is mind-boggling even in such instances too some banks ask the customer to fill up a new application form providing the information which are already there in the bank. Why can’t they without wasting their own valuable time and that of the customer, issue a new card straight away just jamming the previous card?
A payment is made using a credit card, the vendor requests the cardholder to place his/her signature in a slip generates by the Point of Sale (POS) machine of the vendor. This is made compulsory. Do the vendors verify the accuracy of the signature just by comparing the signature placed by the customer on the credit card?  Not at all.  Whether there is a signature or not in the credit card, requirement to place the signature is made mandatory. It is very clear no vendor verifies the accuracy of the signature and it has become a routine work. Hence why can’t the bank prevent this fruitless unnecessary practice? 
Has the bank addressed the issue of under-banked population in the rural peripheries of the country and attempted to provide them with this emerging facility? Yes; a few banks have reached them but comparatively still in a deprived situation. More opportunities are there and it would be a good market segment for banks to exploit. But the present cumbersome procedure needs to be evaded. 
 
Additional charges imposed
Are the banks aware that some prominent traders including a few wholesale distributors even in major cities add 2.5% to 3.5% to the bill value when the payment is made by a credit card? What is the logic behind this is not well-defined and the very same trader is also not able to clarify when a customer asks the reason for it. Does this encourage the customers to avoid the agony of cash transactions? 
Limitations imposed by banks and NBFIs for withdrawals by cards also hinder the acceleration of this move. In some cases this limit has come down to Rs. 50,000 or Rs. 60,000 per day. It is to be appreciated that some banks have rather higher limitations such as Rs. 200,000 or so. If the banks are really interested in harnessing the benefits of cost effectiveness and the efficiency, these limitations are totally not warranted. As a result of these limitations, multiple transactions are often needed and transaction fees to be incurred by the customer definitely mount up. May be that these limitations have been imposed to such a lower level to shrink the forgeries or the dread they have in respect of the forgeries. Need to analyse and see whether such limitations indeed have prevented forgeries or rather prevented the electronic transactions. It is clear undeniably, the answer is the latter.
It is no doubt in the near future ATMs transactions will become more popular and increase the number of withdrawals likely to be full service terminals instead of traditional cashiers or tellers. CBSL can intervene and impose a maximum limit of say Rs. 200,000 or Rs. 250,000 applicable to all banks and NBFIs which seems to be more coherent.
When an e- payment method is used by a customer, he/she is compelled to pay a fee. The charges range from Rs. 5 to Rs. 200 or more depending on the nature of the transaction and on the bank. Customers should be allowed to use the e-payment methods and cash withdrawals at no charge. Why? Electronic payment methods take some of the customer service burdens totally helping the banks to mainly save their payroll costs and other related costs drastically. The time involvement of employees could be devoted for more productive works. Are we in Sri Lanka getting this service free of charge? No; mammoth charges are levied almost all the banks and NBFIs for each and every e payment transaction. Fund transfers within the bank are allowed free of charge by some banks and for all other payment methods a fee needs be made.
One can logically squabble how a service can be provided with no charges. There is a lucid in this argument. However, when financial statements are published by banks and NBFIs annually it is very apparent they disclose their profits in millions or rather billions. No bank reports a loss. Total wealth runs into trillions. Who has helped the bank to reach this healthiness? No doubt it is the customer. Then why can’t the banks to reverse back a very little amount of these profits to its customer who has indeed helped the bank to be financially sound and strong. 
Banks and NBFIs heavily spend for advertisements and promotions. In this respect the amount spent by a few State banks is colossal.  Maybe they consider this as an investment. If so such investments should give them back a delightful return. It is very doubt whether these banks appraise the return that they gain on these huge expenses or rather return less investments.
One or two months ago the Secretary to the President has issued some directives requesting the State institutions including State banks to curtail the expenses incurred by those State institutions for advertisements and promotions. This directly applies to State banks. 
The Governor of CBSL also has directed the Licensed Commercial Banks to avoid unnecessary expenses saying, “Licensed Commercial Banks shall also refrain till 30 June 2021 from buying back its own shares, increasing management allowances and payments to Board of Directors, exercise prudence and refrain to the extent possible from incurring non-essential expenditure such as advertising, promotions, gift schemes, entertainment, sponsorships, travelling and training.”
These two directives alone mirrored that the cost incurred by banks are non-essential expenses.
As outlined above, the charges levied on customers for e-payment transactions can be totally suspended since through e-payment transactions the customers help the banks to massively save the payroll costs and other costs linked with the printing of forms/slips and costs associated with paper work, distributing physical currency etc. It is no doubt directly the e-payment process help the bank to increase the productivity of employees and employees can be diverted for more productive activities.
The above stated issues seem to be very trouble-free minor issues but when they aggregate together stand against accomplishing the above said objectives.
Therefore all the banks and NBFIs cooperatively with the participation of business sector and respective service providers should endeavour to address the above issues and take immediate steps to rectify them. That alone will be a most valid encouragement for the people to involve in e-payment methods and to avoid the agony of cash transactions.

This award is therefore very significant for SANASA life insurance.  International Business Magazine, the Dubai, United Arab Emirates based publication, recognises the awardees considering the business, business leaders and their skills in the field of international business and finance, as well as the progress achieved by those businesses. 
In the year 2020, SANASA Life Insurance won two awards by International Business Magazine: Best Employee Benefit Provider – 2020 and Best Micro Insurance Company – 2020.

Asset risk at Sri Lankan insurers has increased due to the sovereign’s weaker credit profile and the consequent lowering of national ratings of some state-owned and private-sector institutions, says Fitch Ratings in a report published yesterday.
The increased asset risk, however, will not greatly affect the regulatory capital ratios of most Fitch-rated Sri Lankan insurers due to the limited rise in risk charges according to local risk-based capital (RBC) rules.
The local regulatory RBC rules exempt debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Government from charges on credit and concentration risk in the calculation of the regulatory capital ratio. In addition, some of the recent negative national rating actions were within the same national rating category and therefore not subject to additional credit risk charges according to these rules.
Fitch downgraded Sri Lanka’s sovereign rating to ‘CCC’, from ‘B-’, in November 2020 due to the country’s increasingly challenging external-debt repayment position over the medium term. 
Fitch estimates that as at end-June 2020 Fitch-rated insurers had invested around 55% of their fixed-income portfolios in direct Government securities, such as treasury bills, bonds, Sri Lanka development bonds, repos and unit-trust assets backed by Government securities, and around 16% in deposits and debt securities issued by state-owned enterprises, including banks, non-banking financial institutions and corporations.
Fitch recalibrated the national rating scale following the sovereign downgrade, resulting in the downward revision or downgrade of the national ratings of some State-owned and private-sector institutions. 
Fitch estimates that around 12% of the fixed-income investment portfolios of Fitch-rated insurers, or around 28% of deposits and debt instrument portfolios, were invested in these entities.

One is that, as the chamber has identified, many of the employees of various capacities in organisations have no proper understanding and fair awareness on the role and activities of the Stock Exchange and the share market.
The second reason is that the time is opportune to look for new avenues by both individuals and organisations for savings and investments taking the country’s current scenario into consideration.  
Abeyratne Muthugala further said that it would be an interesting webinar and believed that not only private sector organisations, but also many other public sector organisations and any interested individual would find it useful to be aware of the Stock Exchange, its role and impact to the economy of the country. 
The content of the scheduled webinar includes ‘Share Market as an Economic Indicator of a country,’ ‘What is a share?,’ ‘Colombo Stock Exchange,’ ‘Purpose of Stock Exchange,’ ‘How to open a CDS A/C,’ ‘Types of Securities,’ ‘Benefits of Investing,’ ‘How to do a Trade,’ ‘Transaction Cost,’ ‘CSE Performance Indices,’ and ‘Current Market Condition’.
This important webinar will be conducted by Colombo Stock Exchange Senior Executive – Investor Education Imesha Fernando who has long years of experience in the field and possesses very good training skills. 
For further details, please call CNCI secretariat or write to cnci@slt.lk, visit the CNCI website www.cnci.lk and/or www.facebook.com/THECNCI for further details. CNCI offers discounts to the companies sending three or more participants.

Presenting of a QR code and POS material to a merchant at the Narahenpita Economical Centre by DFCC Bank Manager Merchant Acquiring Chrishan Jayamanne (centre) during the promotional campaign 

As an unwavering partner in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s efforts to reduce the usage of physical cash by promoting QR payments under the Rata Puraama Quick Response (QR) initiative, DFCC, the bank for everyone, recently conducted a promotional campaign at the Narahenpita Economic Centre in line with this objective. 
The successful promotional campaign resulted in increased awareness and usage of DFCC Pay App that enables QR code transactions. As the Narahenpita Economic Centre is an important hub for trade in Colombo, many vendors and customers were able to gain insight into the convenience of using a QR-based payment method via DFCC Pay App. 
As the Sri Lankan population has started to embrace avenues of new technology which offer greater convenience and security, DFCC has assumed an active role in supporting the CBSL’s vision of building a cashless future. As a financial institution which continues to leverage the use of advancements in technology and digitalisation, it is expected that the shared values of DFCC and the CBSL will result in an even faster adoption of QR technology among the general public. 
DFCC is no stranger to the benefits of enabling their customers to use QR-based payment methods. The launch of DFCC’s pay app in January 2019 resulted in the bank becoming among the first financial institutions to be certified for the LANKAQR standard which is now accepted as the national common QR. 
The trailblazing Pay App permits customers to make retail payments using smart mobile devices through funds available in their current or savings account to the merchant’s account directly. The DFCC Pay App provides a convenient, secure and affordable option for making retail payments which is otherwise primarily made by cash. DFCC Credit Cards can also be added to the DFCC Pay App to facilitate Visa QR local and overseas transactions at VISA QR enabled merchant outlets through a smart mobile device.
Similarly, the DFCC Pay Merchant App can be used by all types of merchants in the country from large corporates, SMEs to wayside vendors to accept these payments. DFCC Bank QR Merchants can accept payments even with the use of a basic feature phone as the payment confirmation can be sent as an SMS Alert.

NEW YORK (Reuters): Insurer American International Group Inc posted a net loss of $60 million in the fourth quarter, mainly due to a $1.2 billion loss from derivatives, the company said on Tuesday, but its adjusted earnings hit analysts’ targets.
Quarterly adjusted profit totaled $827 million, or 94 cents a share, down from $923 million, or $1.03 a share, a year ago. Analysts had expected 93 cents a share, according to data from Refinitiv.
For the full year, AIG posted a $6 billion net loss, largely due to its sale of Fortitude Group Holdings LLC last June. But it met analysts’ estimates with full-year adjusted earnings of $2.2 billion, or $2.52 a share.
The lower 2020 results reflected $1.1 billion in costs related to COVID-19 for the year, and higher losses on catastrophe coverage, the company said.
It company noted that fourth-quarter adjusted pre-tax income of $809 million for its general insurance was up 4% from a year ago. For its life and retirement segment, the figure rose 20% to $1.027 billion.
AIG did not provide a 2021 outlook, having suspended such guidance after the first quarter of 2020. It also did not provide an update on the plan to exit the life and retirement business that it announced last year.
The company will hold a conference call with analysts on Wednesday morning.

Gary Cokins, CPIM




The Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA) will conduct a webinar on ‘Lean Accounting and Activity Based Costing – A Choice or a Blend’ on Thursday, 18 February from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. via online Zoom platform. 
CMA Sri Lanka is the national professional management accounting body in Sri Lanka set up by an Act of Parliament and member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) the global body for the accounting profession, South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA) the regional body for the South Asian Region and the Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants (CAPA) the accounting body for the Asian and Pacific region. 
This presentation addresses confusion that management accountants have. There are debates in the management accounting community about what is the most appropriate costing method. There are rival camps. For example, some lean accounting advocates who create ‘value stream maps’ criticise activity-based costing (ABC). There are passionate advocates of ABC because it provides much greater cost accuracy and visibility to cost drivers compared to the flawed and misleading costs from traditional and grotesquely cost distorting cost allocation methods. Who is correct? 
What is needed is to ask a different question that resolves this dilemma. That question is about how a company might have two or more co-existing management accounting methods. There can be different costs for different purposes used by different types of managers and employee teams. 
Gary Cokins presentation includes ‘What has created interest in activity-based costing (ABC)?’, ‘How do you design an ABC model that becomes an ABC system?’, ‘What are barriers preventing organisations from implementing ABC?’, ‘What are solutions that overcome those barriers?’, ‘What is the purpose and benefits of lean accounting?’ and ‘How can organisations apply both lean accounting and ABC?’
The webinar will be conducted by Gary Cokins, an internationally recognised expert, speaker, and author in advanced cost management and performance improvement systems. He is the founder of Analytics-Based Performance Management, an advisory firm located in Cary, North Carolina at www.garycokins.com. Gary received a BS degree with honours in Industrial Engineering/Operations Research from Cornell University in 1971. He received his MBA from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management in 1974.
The webinar will conclude with a question-and-answer session where participants will also have an opportunity to discuss practical applications and obtain clarifications via chat option.

LONDON (Reuters): A record $ 58.1 billion poured into global equity funds over the past week as investors pulled money out of cash funds and had a lighter exposure to bonds, BofA’s weekly fund flow data showed on Friday.
World stocks notched all-time highs this week as earnings and economic recovery prospects buoyed investor sentiment.
The rush to equities saw extreme positioning among the US investment bank’s wealth management clients, with 63.1% allocated to equities – the highest ever – and 19.1% to debt – the lowest ever.
The investment bank said a bulk of last week’s flows ended up in US equities with $ 36.3 billion inflows, the best ever, with large-cap funds taking in $ 25.1 billion in the week to Wednesday.
Relentless buying in big tech stocks has also been a major feature in recent investment trends. Tech funds attracted $ 5.4 billion, beating last week’s record $ 4.2 billion inflows.
BofA’s Bull and Bear indicator hit 7.7, just shy of “extreme bullish” levels in a sign of exuberance.
The risk-on mood triggered outflows from cash and gold. Cash funds lost $ 10.6 billion, while gold recorded its first outflows in two months with $ 800 million fleeing. Bond funds saw $ 13.1 billion inflows.

Abans Finance PLC has announced its highest-ever after-tax profit of Rs. 188 million for the first nine months of FY21, despite the turbulent period due to COVID-19.
This was an increase of 1465% from the profit for the corresponding nine-month period last year where PAT was only Rs 12 million. 
The achievement was whilst adhering to the Central Bank debt moratorium guidelines and taking a day-one loss of Rs. 72 million on the first moratorium. 
Impressive results are also hot on the heels of the recent upgrade by Fitch Ratings in January 2021, from ‘BB+(lka)’ to ‘A (lka)’,
Abans Finance is a principal member of the prestigious Abans Group, the renowned household name in Sri Lanka. Through the backing of the Abans Group and a strong management team, led by CEO Dharshan Silva, the company has been able to diversify its lending portfolio, reduce its funding cost and improve collections to develop one of the best performances for a finance company in the past nine months. 
“A key to this success has been the strong recovery culture within the organisation with close tracking of performance metrics coupled with incentives for everyone in the organisation. All this has been achieved whilst managing new COVID-19 protocols, including work-from-home models for staff and ensuring uninterrupted customer service,” Abans Finance said in a statement.

Hong Kong (Reuters): Asian shares rallied on Tuesday, setting the stage for world equities to extend their bull run for a 12th consecutive session, as investors banked on a rollout of coronavirus vaccines to keep the global economic recovery on track.
Oil prices jumped to a 13-month high as a deep freeze due to a severe snow storm in the United States not only boosted power demand but also threatened oil production in Texas.
Asia’s surging shares set the way for renewed optimism on global markets.
S&P500 futures were up 0.5% and MSCI’s all country world index (ACWI), which has risen every day so far this month, ticked up slightly.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shot up 0.62%, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.4% to a 30-year high.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 1.4% to hit a 32-month high, while Australia’s S&P/ASX200 gained 0.7% for the session. Mainland Chinese markets will remain closed for the holidays until Thursday.
The positive sentiment was also extended to Bitcoin which flirted with breaking through the $ 50,000 barrier.
Bitcoin was trading at $ 49,323.56 in the Asian afternoon trading session, slightly below its record high of $ 49,715 hit on Sunday..
JPMorgan Private Bank head of Asia investment strategy Alex Wolf said the ongoing coronavirus vaccine rollout was giving investors confidence that global growth would be protected in 2021.
“This is a positive factor that we are coming into the process of economic normalisation,” Wolf said.
Ord Minnett advisor John Milroy said while share markets were positive investors were becoming wary of the future risk of inflation due to central bank and government stimulus programmes in place around the world.
“There is a clear sense with rates staying low for some time yet and investor appetite for equities staying strong we will likely see markets hold up for some time yet,” Milroy told Reuters.
“Gaining traction is the thought that inflation could rise much faster and sooner than the Fed is currently thinking. Then if they do raise rates to combat it what happens to equity markets and of course bond markets.”
The bullish view on the economy lifted bond yields, with the 10-year US Treasuries gaining 5 basis points to 1.24% in Asian trade, its highest since late March.
Investors are looking to the minutes from the US Federal Reserve’s January meeting, due to be published on Wednesday, for confirmation of its commitment to maintain its dovish policy stance over the near future. That in turn is set to keep a tab on bond yields.
But some analysts say investors should keep a wary eye on bond yields.
“If US bond yields keep rising, that could start to unsettle stocks,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.
Wolf said JPMorgan’s private bank forecast US 10-year yields could reach 1.5% by the end of 2021, as investors again banked on further economic stimulus which could help global growth prospects.
“An increase in yields is not a large concern for the rest of the world. It’s the pace of the increase that tends to matter most from an Asian perspective. If there’s a rapid repricing then that can have a negative effect for emerging markets,” he said.
US President Joe Biden is pushing ahead with his plan to pump an extra $ 1.9 trillion in stimulus into the economy, in a further boost to market sentiment.
US crude futures were trading up 1.1% at $ 60.11 per barrel.

CA Sri Lanka Faculty of Taxation Chairman Sulaiman Nishtar




In its standing as the change makers of the country’s professional landscape, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) has been at the forefront in enhancing the knowledge and
competence of finance and non-finance professionals. In fulfilling this important objective, CA Sri Lanka recently organised a public seminar on tax which received a massive response.  
The online public seminar titled ‘Awareness on Personal Tax Obligations’ attracted over 725 participants who joined the free seminar conducted early this month.  
The seminar was organised amidst increasing concerns expressed by the public in relation to opening income tax files and file returns. The Government announced and implemented significant tax changes from 1 January where the Advance Personal Income Tax (APIT) was introduced in lieu of Pay-As-You-Earn tax (PAYE Tax). 
In the past, tax payers who only had employment income were not required to file income tax returns, as PAYE tax was deducted from their income by the employer and remitted to the Inland Revenue Department. However, from January 2020, everyone who is in the tax liable range, are required to register with the Inland Revenue Department and comply with the respective tax obligations.  
During the seminar, BDO Partners Partner – Tax Services Sarah Afker made a detailed presentation which covered important aspects in relation to the personal tax obligation components including sources of income, qualifying payments and reliefs, available exemptions, personal tax rates, concessionary rates and how to compute taxable income, and tax payable.  
The seminar was further boosted with an expert panel discussion featuring CA Sri Lanka Tax Committee Former Chairperson Hiranthi Ratnayake, CA Sri Lanka Faculty of Taxation Alternate Chairman Denzil Rodrigo, Gajma & Co. Partner N.R. Gajendran, Consultants Consortium Principal Consultant V. Sivagurunathan, and Assent Advisory Partners Managing Partner/Director Athula Ranaweera. CA Sri Lanka Faculty of Taxation Chairman Sulaiman Nishtar moderated the session.  
The Tax Faculty was established in 1995 to assist chartered accountants and non-accounting professionals to further their knowledge in taxation. The faculty conducts various courses and programs including seminars and workshops targeting professionals and practitioners to further their knowledge in the subject. The Tax Faculty also organises events hosted by eminent speakers to share knowledge on subjects related to local and international tax matters.

Research shows growing confidence among consumers and business leaders that robots handle finance tasks better than people

Austin, Texas: Year 2020 has changed our relationship with money and people now trust robots more than themselves to manage their finances, according to a new study by Oracle and Personal Finance Expert Farnoosh Torabi. 
The study of more than 9,000 consumers and business leaders in 14 countries found that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased financial anxiety, sadness, and fear among people around the world and has changed who and what we trust to manage our finances. In addition, people are rethinking the role and focus of corporate finance teams and personal financial advisors, according to the research.

COVID-19 has created financial anxiety, sadness, and fear 
The global pandemic has damaged people’s relationship with money at home and at work.

Among business leaders, financial anxiety and stress increased by 186% and sadness grew by 116%; consumer financial anxiety and stress doubled and sadness increased by 70%.
90% of business leaders worry about the impact of COVID-19 on their organisation, with the most common concerns centring on a slow economic recovery or recession (51%); budget cuts (38%); and bankruptcy (27%).
87% of consumers are experiencing financial fears, including job loss (39%); losing savings (38%); and never getting out of debt (26%).
These concerns are keeping people up at night: 41% of consumers reported losing sleep due to their personal finances.

 
People see robots as a better way to manage finances
The financial uncertainty created by COVID-19 has changed who and what we trust to manage our finances. To help navigate financial complexity, consumers and business leaders increasingly trust technology over people to help. 

67% of consumers and business leaders trust a robot more than a human to manage finances.
73% of business leaders trust a robot more than themselves to manage finances; 77% trust robots over their own finance teams.
89% of business leaders believe that robots can improve their work by detecting fraud (34%); creating invoices (25%); and conducting cost/benefit analysis (23%).
53% of consumers trust a robot more than themselves to manage finances; 63% trust robots over personal financial advisors.
66% of consumers believe robots can help detect fraud (33%); reduce spending (22%); and make stock market investments (15%).

 
The role of finance teams and financial advisors will never be the same
To adapt to the growing influence and role of technology, corporate finance professionals and personal finance advisors alike must embrace change and develop new skills.

Our relationship with money has changed, it’s time to embrace AI to manage finance
The events of 2020 have changed the way consumers think about money and have increased the need for organisations to rethink how they use AI and other new technologies to manage financial processes. 

60% of consumers say the pandemic has changed the way they buy goods and services.
72% of consumers say the events of 2020 have changed how they feel about handling cash, with people feeling anxious (26%); fearful (23%); and dirty (19%). More than a quarter (29%) of consumers now say that cash-only is a deal-breaker for doing business.
Businesses have been quick to respond as 69% of business leaders have invested in digital payment capabilities and 64% have created new forms of customer engagement or changed their business models in response to COVID-19.
51% of organisations are already using AI to manage financial processes, compared with 27% of consumers.
87% of business leaders say organisations that don’t rethink financial processes face risks, including falling behind competitors (44%); more stressed workers (36%); inaccurate reporting (36%); and reduced employee productivity (35%).

“Managing finances is tough at the best of times, and the financial uncertainty of the global pandemic has exacerbated financial challenges at home and at work,” said Farnoosh Torabi, Personal Finance Expert and host of the So Money podcast. 
“Robots are well-positioned to assist – they are great with numbers and don’t have the same emotional connection with money. This doesn’t mean finance professionals are going away or being replaced entirely, but the research suggests they should focus on developing additional soft skills as their role evolves.”
“Financial processes in our personal and professional worlds have become increasingly digital for many years and the events of 2020 have accelerated that trend,” said Juergen Lindner, Senior Vice President, Global Marketing, Oracle. 
“Digital is the new normal and technologies such as artificial intelligence and chatbots play a vital role in managing finance. Our research indicates that consumers trust these technologies to accelerate their financial well-being over personal financial advisors and business leaders see this trend reshaping the role of corporate finance professionals. Organisations that don’t embrace these changes risk falling behind their peers and competitors; hurting employee productivity, morale and well-being; and struggling to attract the next generation of AI-empowered finance talent.”

The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) recently conducted a forum for the Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) of several private companies with the view of encouraging them to list on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
The SEC has had a continuous dialog with all stakeholders of the capital market and has emphasised on the need to take aggressive measures to develop the market in order to ensure that it is the preferred place to raise capital.
Only a few companies have listed on the CSE during the last several years and that was seen as one of the reasons for inadequate level of liquidity and relatively small size of the market. The SEC recently approved a new framework for listing of companies, granting complete autonomy to the CSE in the listing process and has also relaxed the Listing Rules in order to encourage more listings.
The aim of this forum was to reach out to companies that are not listed in order to make them aware of the benefits of getting listed and to apprise them of the key proposals included in the Government’s budget for 2021 which has provided certain tax exemptions to companies who list prior to 31 December 2021. 
SEC Chairman Viraj Dayaratne PC made the opening remarks and explained the advantages of obtaining a listing, especially during the current positive market environment and stated that the process involved in listing a company was not as cumbersome or expensive as is generally perceived. He requested them to take the message to their respective boards.
Those present had the benefit of insightful presentations by CSE Chief Regulatory Officer (CRO) Renuke Wijayawardhane and SEC Commission members Manil Jayesinghe and Naresh Abeysekera.
Wijayawardhane outlined the requirements and processes involved in listing and Jayesinghe explained in detail how listing on the CSE was an attractive option for companies to raise funds. He highlighted as to why this method of raising capital was more advantageous than other methods through which a company was able to raise capital.
Naresh Abeysekera pointed out how the digital platform can be used to raise capital in the near future and benefits that listed companies can derive from the CSE mobile application.
The forum concluded with a panel discussion featuring the Chairman, the two Commission members, Director General Chinthaka Mendis and the CRO of the CSE. The panel discussion created the space for a dialogue between the panellists and the CFOs who participated at the forum.
The SEC intends in the future to organise events where the Chairmen/CEOs of companies would be spoken to in order to take this initiative forward.

Access to and use of Commercial Bank of Ceylon’s multiple mobile banking apps has become even easier with the launch by the bank of an aggregator app that bundles them together as a single download.
The aggregator can be found by iOS as well as Android users in the App Store and Google Play respectively by simply searching for ‘Commercial Bank,’ the bank said.
The aggregator app eliminates the requirement of operating through separate downloads of different apps launched by the bank and simplifies the mobile banking experience of customers.
It currently enables customers to access five of the bank’s core mobile applications: ‘ComBank Digital’, ComBank ePassbook, ComBank eSlip, ComBank Q+, and ComBank Remit Plus. The bank said all mobile apps it offers will eventually be included, with new apps to be launched being automatically updated on the aggregator.

We continue to focus on introducing more digital products and services to enhance access and versatility to match the lifestyle and requirements of the modern customer.”
Once the aggregator app is downloaded, it prompts users to select one of apps in the suite to complete their operation. If the selected app already exists on the user’s device, it will be launched instantly. Users can register for the apps that are relevant to them once downloaded through the app aggregator.
ComBank digital app is the integration of all its online and mobile banking channels on a single omni channel platform. The bank’s digital banking channels including ComBank Digital, a highly secure, user-friendly and responsive web application catering to both retail and business users. While the ComBank Remit Plus App enables those who use the bank’s remittance services to conveniently access remittance-related information and services, the ComBank eSlip app launched recently encourages paperless banking by facilitating cash and cheque deposits to current and savings accounts.

Commercial Bank was the first financial institution in Asia to launch the revolutionary ePassbook.

Weekly bill auction undersubscribed for third consecutive week
Rupee closes mostly unchanged


By Wealth Trust Securities

The upward momentum in secondary market bond yields witnessed over the previous few weeks continued during the trading week ending 12 February as well. Continued selling interest driven by the outcome of the weekly Treasury bill auction along with uncertain market conditions were seen as the reasons behind the increase in yields. At the weekly auction, only an amount of Rs. 13.92 billion was accepted in total against its total offered amount of Rs. 40 billion.
Activity was witnessed across the yield curve as the liquid maturities of 2022’s (i.e. 01.10.22 and 15.12.22), 01.10.23, 2024’s (i.e. 15.09.24 and 01.12.24), 01.05.25, 2027’s (i.e. 15.08.27 and 01.10.27) and 15.05.30 saw its yields edge up to intraweek highs of 5.57%, 5.55%, 5.95%, 6.62%, 6.67%, 6.90%, 7.31%, 7.35% and 8.02% respectively against its previous weeks closing levels of 5.40/45, 5.42/48, 5.90/97, 6.38/45, 6.45/50, 6.60/70, 7.15/20, 7.15/25 and 7.70/85, reflecting an upward shift of the yield curve week on week.

By Softlogic Stockbrokers

The dawn of the New Year began with markets being viewed as ‘exciting’ as retailers battled over targeted stocks with the expectation of stock splits. Stock prices continued to rally as short-term traders anticipated further upside. 
They were right – but the optimism lasted only for a month. On 11 February, the Colombo Stock Market experienced its worst decline after March 2020, but bounced back very strongly the next day. 
During the sudden but short-lived collapse, many investors experienced their portfolios dropping by almost 50%. The panic of losing further prompted investors to keep hitting the sell button which created a fleeting, yet ‘Black’ Thursday (11th). Despite its biggest fall, the market rebounded very strongly on Friday (12th) with the assurance provided by SEC and the State Minister for Money and Capital Markets. This crash and subsequent rally resulted in three different outcomes – investors that panicked and sold off their positions incurred significant capital losses while the investors that didn’t embark on the drastic selling spree saw their portfolios bouncing back to pre-collapse levels. Another group of active investors managed to make day returns exploiting on the dip and the immediate recovery.
The fall on Thursday was the worst decline new retailers have faced recently. However, we believe it will make them more mature to approach the market with an understanding that market declines are surprising and unexpected. It also gives them an added perception that even declines are opportunities for a set of investors to grab on to stocks which are fundamentally strong and would yield returns even in the ‘darkest’ of times.
Many new retail investors have limited insight into how much risk they can absorb and therefore sudden market crashes of this nature would result in mental stress leading to extreme decisions. Our recommendation is that new investors stay away from trading on excess margins which in turn would give them the confidence to hold on to their portfolio during down time as well as buying power to capitalise on panic selling. Risk management is crucial to survive any market crash as the event maybe unpredictable, but the occurrence is inevitable. 
With yields in fixed income markets at historically low levels and excess liquidity slushing around, the investment thesis for the stock market clearly stands out. Earnings season has been supportive of the recovery narrative, with local manufacturing and export-oriented companies continuing to post exponential growth in earnings on a year-on-year basis.  
Meanwhile, CBSL has assured investors of their long-term plan for loose monetary conditions and low rates. Finally, the State Minister for Money and Capital Markets appears to be determined to push through the market re-rating which had fallen for a couple of years.

Union Assurance has added another facet to its digital experience with a self-service app, Clicklife, to meet the increasing demand for mobility and remote accessibility to policyholders. 
The Clicklife mobile app is part of an end-to-end digital insurance solution offered by Union Assurance, and now allows consumers to manage and be updated in real-time on their policies including balances, dues, claim status and loan submission. 
The Clicklife app allows customers to connect with Union Assurance anywhere, anytime, managing policies, making claims as well as premium payments conveniently, efficiently, and securely. The Clicklife app goes one step further by enabling consumers to carry out digital policy loan submissions, which previously consumed time and required tedious paperwork. 
Commenting on the digital initiative of Union Assurance, Chief Technical Officer Rumesh Modarage said: “We are disrupting legacy systems to make transactions 100% transparent. Policyholders can now access real-time information on their policy at their fingertips. Call centres and agents have been the frequent touch point for customers to change, or request policy-related information such as address or contact change, claims submission, loan submission and balance statements. But now, the app will offer all these services, empowering the customer to have 100% control over their portfolio.” 
Another exciting facet of the app is the inclusion of a health tracker which offers regular health tips, that double as rewards with vouchers and discount coupons for customers, redeemable instantly across a growing partner network.
“Union Assurance is leading the digital transformation of Sri Lanka’s life insurance landscape, simplifying the process of buying protection,” stated Union Assurance Chief Marketing Officer Lucille Diaz.
“Part of this digital transformation journey was to address our customer needs, and eliminate bottlenecks, paperwork and legacy systems. Claims and follow-ups were deemed by consumers to be extremely time-consuming and labour-intensive processes. Now with the launch of our Clicklife self-service app, we have created a seamless user experience eliminating delays and affording real-time updates to consumers, meeting the challenging demand of today’s rapidly evolving consumer lifestyles and current reality.”
The app affords the insured full control of their policies, with additional features such as a loyalty program, customisable dashboard for real-time policy overviews, as well as instant access to online agents 24/7.
Powered by cutting-edge mobile technology, the Clicklife App is available for download at the App Store and Google Play Store for all iOS and Android users, with the first 1,000 users to download the app standing a chance to win exciting merchandise.

Nishan Premathiratne




Following the sharp dip in the Colombo Bourse, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) (YAF) Regional Representative for Sri Lanka and the Sector Specialist for Commercial Law Reforms of the
Ministry of Justice and Attorney-at-Law Nishan Premathiratne, yesterday opined that regulation should not be brought in such a hurry but should be done cautiously, giving time for stakeholders to adapt to regulations in a gradual manner. 
“Regulators of capital markets being proactive and taking steps to closely scrutinise and monitor market affairs is a good thing. However, there is a thin line between regulation and over-regulation. The consequence of certain circulars which are intended to be in the best interest of the entire stock market and also to protect investor interest, could actually result in changing the overall market sentiment. This in turn might actually be counter-productive and against the interest of all investors. The new circular which has been issued with the objective of clearing stockbroker credit has seemingly caused the stockbrokers to force-sell shares resulting in the overall share prices coming down,” opined Premathiratne. 
He also said: “Going forward, I think it is in the interest of the entire stock market and in the interest of all investors that these circulars be re-looked at, wherein a more gradual process of clearing credit of certain stockbrokers should be effected. This in turn would provide the brokers with a reasonable degree of flexibility and could resurrect the market, more over preventing the market from coming down any further and reaching record lows.”
From being hailed as ‘The World’s Best Stock Rally’ by Bloomberg.com at a time when many Sri Lankan citizens were actively investing in the stock market, the Colombo Stock Exchange has plummeted over 1,500 points within a period of a mere 10 days, unleashing catastrophic effects upon the investments of individuals.
Having reached a record high of 9,000 points in late January, 11 February saw the market plummeting more than 500 points, compelling the market to be stalled where trading was stopped twice when share prices plummeted 20% in most counters.
The downward trend started from on or around the 1 February, when market regulators issued a circular to all broker firms which resulted in a free-fall in the market over the last 10 days.

Empowers the Backbone of the Economy to grow and prosper


In 2020, Seylan Bank was named the most popular banking service provider in Sri Lanka in the exclusive customer experience ranking announced by LMD, for the second consecutive year. For the team of dedicated bankers and SME relationship officers who work with the backbone of the economy, this is just how they do things. Great relationships coupled with the best products make for excellent customer experiences; helping them grow, prosper and revitalize the economy. 
The inception of Seylan Bank was as a financial institution catering to the small and medium industries (SME) segment of Sri Lanka – an ethos the Bank stands by after all these years, as well as an envious growth trajectory. The Bank boasts a network of 173 branches, spread around the Island, going where the SMEs are.
The government too has identified the importance of SMEs to the successful revitalization of the economy, and to that end the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has introduced many low-interest refinance facilities to support the sector, with the active contribution of local institutions and international entities such as the ADB.

Backbone of the Economy
According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, an SME is a business that generates an annual turnover of less than Rs. 750 million. Constituting the largest industry segment in the Island by numbers, SMEs account for nearly 52% of the country’s GDP.  Standing as the veritable backbone of the economy, SMEs directly contribute to much needed job creation at the ground level and to poverty alleviation.
Seylan Bank has always been keen on serving the SME customer segment, both from a corporate perspective, and also for its national value. Small and Medium Enterprises form the largest component of the formal economy and have also been some of the most affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic fallout from it. However, they have also remained the most resilient and entrepreneurial in the face of adversity, with many enterprises innovating to stay relevant in the new normal. 
Seylan Bank supported their resilience with targeted financial relief measures, including a 6-month debt moratorium and extended loan repayment times during the pandemic. The bank also supported customers who sought working capital loans at low-interest rates for business expansion & growth and extended continuous support to ensure timely processing of salaries, remittances and international trade transactions in a bid to aid the business owners.

Supporting Growth 
The growth and sustenance of these enterprises is vital to the economy, and Seylan Bank has curated special financial facilities and offers to the industry. SME owners in the Agriculture, Agro processing, Manufacturing, Fisheries, Tourism, Animal husbandry, Export oriented businesses and other segments who wish to develop their businesses while strengthening the economy, can avail these special loan schemes, and businesses that wish to access working capital can apply for loans up to Rs. 10 million, repayable over 3 years with a 6-month grace period at an interest rate of 4.7%.
Businesses that wish to install Solar Power up to 50kWH to their business premises and save energy, are offered loans by Seylan at 4% interest, repayable over 10 years with a 6-month grace period. For Small and Medium exporters that take Sri Lanka to the world, Seylan Bank has arranged a very special loan scheme where they can borrow funds up to Rs. 50 million at a very low interest rate of 6%, and repayable over 3 years with a grace period of 6 months added on.

‘SME Hub’ concept
At Seylan, SME Banking is more about long term relationships than providing a one-off facility. Unlike big corporates that have a corporate governance structure and framework, SMEs mostly start off and run as businesses headed by an individual with a small number of staff. Small business owners are dependent on their bank for more than the monetary facilities they provide. They treasure the financial advice, and business acumen they receive from the banking partners to grow and prosper. When they look to expand and finance the business further, the importance of sound financial structuring and planning for the future becomes essential. 
To this end, Seylan Bank has set up SME Hubs for each region of the bank. The Hubs fast-track credit proposals from within the region, saving processing time otherwise lost when everything is sent back to Colombo. The Hubs also act as business advisors to small business owners, helping them structure scalable businesses, plan the big picture, and help them identify profitable growth pathways.
Seylan Bank was the first to appoint ‘SME Relationship Officers’, much ahead of the industry curve. Not only do these officers canvass customers at their door-step, but they commit to support them further, including post disbursement strategies. While this ensures the businesses will grow smoothly and be in a position to pay their facilities in good time; it also helps grow the local economy, resulting in a better financial ecosystem for all involved.

Holistic Solutions
As the Bank with a Heart, Seylan Bank believes in making real change happen. One of the key factors in SME growth is knowledge and awareness of opportunities and identifying new avenues. The Bank regularly organizes value added events such as business seminars, and during the months long lockdown webinars; to arm the SME sector with essential industry tools. The Bank’s commitment to bring SME operators together with representatives of professional bodies pertinent to their businesses enables customers to do better in business, and to grow together with the economy as a vital cog in the national machinery. 
The webinars organized during lockdown successfully focused on key areas such as ‘Digital Transformation Procedures for SMEs’, ‘How to create and uplift a Brand successfully’, ‘How to Upgrade a Home-Based Business Operation’, ‘Methods of Short-Term and Long-Term Cost Control’, ‘New ways of Marketing Products and Services’, and much more. These exclusive forums were completed in partnership with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and experts from various industries and sectors. 
Since lockdown lifted, the Bank met small business owners in Kandy at a workshop to ‘Mobilize Visionary Entrepreneurs’, and also launched the ‘Diyunuwata Saviyak’ SME Workshop. Most recently, the Bank organized a seminar for export finance, with Bank officials together with professionals from the Export Development Board creating awareness and adding to the knowledge of small time exporters.

Digital Advantage
When the global pandemic shut down Sri Lanka early last year, Seylan Bank was one of the best prepared. Having foreseen the need for digitization early on, the Bank had already put in place robust infrastructure to enable digital transactions on multiple channels. Once the lockdown took effect, the Bank smoothly transitioned to a digital set up, considering the safety and convenience of both employees and customers.
While the majority of SMEs operate outside the Western Province and some firmly in the physical domain; second and third generation owners are younger and more keen to create a digital presence even for traditional businesses, along with new age e-commerce entrepreneurs operating entirely online and in the social media space. This digital infrastructure growth has benefited these SMEs immensely, with some unique offerings targeting the sector. Beyond mobile banking, Seylan Bank’s upgraded and interactive website, and the smartphone apps, the Bank provides total online payment solutions for small businesses operating in the digital space, through Seylan Merchant Portal, an all in one and multipurpose payment portal with integrated internet payment gateways, which can enable all online payment acceptance needs from remote customers. 

Building a Support System
For Seylan Bank, courting SMEs has never been only about acquiring customers for one-off facilities. Even as the Bank grew to a leader in the industry, it has supported businessmen grow their owner-operator business to multi-tier enterprises, offered them unique saving and investment products to ensure capital protection, and supported their personal growth with added facilities including housing loans.
Going a step further, the Bank also offers payroll management systems for small businesses and assists them with financial management solutions. Added to this is the mPOS system transforming smartphones into mobile credit card terminals for businesses on the go, POS machines for the more established places, and IPG systems for businesses conducting online transactions with remote entities.

Standing Out from the Crowd
Businesses thrive on relationships. Seylan Bank values the trust placed in it by business owners who seek advice on fund utilization, future proofing and business growth, and ensures it has long term clients with excellent relationships with the Bank and its people. Seylan Bank’s special SME loan schemes will allow eligible businesses to grow and prosper as the country works towards regrowing the economy and creating a prosperous future. Small and Medium business owners who wish to be part of this growth journey can contact the bank for further information on the loan schemes, and to ascertain eligibility.

About Seylan Bank
Seylan Bank PLC, the Bank with a Heart, operates with a vision to offer the ultimate banking experience to its valued customers through cutting-edge technology, innovative products, and best-in-class service. The Bank has a growing clientele of SMEs, Retail and Corporate Customers and has expanded its footprint with 173 branches across the country and an ATM network of 216 units. Seylan Bank has been endorsed as a financially stable organisation with performance excellence across the board by Fitch Ratings, with the bank’s national long-term rating revised upward, from ‘A-(lka)’ to ‘A (lka)’. The bank was ranked second among public listed companies for transparency in corporate reporting by Transparency Global. Seylan Bank has also been named the Most Popular Banking Service Provider in Sri Lanka in Customer Experience by LMD consecutively in 2019 and 2020.

The findings of the study have important implications for diverse users to formulate their future policy decisions for the development of the stock market and the economy 

By Dewundara Liyanage Prasath Manjula Rathnasingha and Nayomi Weerasinghe


4. Analysis and discussion  
‘Do sell side security analysts act as prophets?’ has to be carefully examined through understanding the relationship between the information contained in consensus return (RCP) and realised stock return (Rit). Then the researcher attempts to explain the findings of the study from a different perspective giving novel insights to the existing literature. The research question outlined, guide the researcher throughout starting with descriptive analysis concerning the variables of the study. Then aims to ensure statistical assumptions underlying in the estimation model through a test of validity and reliability. Finally, the results of hypothesis testing through multiple regression models discuss to achieve the research objectives. 
 4.1. Descriptive statistics  
The descriptive analysis aims to provide an overview of the variables under the study based on the sample data to make a general conclusion. Accordingly, Table 1 shows the average value of stock return, consensus return and risk factors together with their standard deviation values and t statistics. The information evidence that the mean value of the Rit is 1% per month and the average value of RCP is 1.1% per month. The average value of Rit is significant and different from zero at a 10% significance level, whereas RCP is significant at a 5% level. 
4.2. Inferential statistics 
The test of the hypothesis is the main focus under inferential analysis. Based on the hypotheses establish, statistical test conduct for their acceptance or rejection and facilitate the achievement of the research objectives and ultimately address the research problem of the study. 
4.2.1. The relationship between stock return and consensus return 
 The empirical studies have evidence that there is a direct relationship between stock return and consensus return. Hence, hypothesis 1 developed by the researcher to test the relationship postulate in the present study. The descriptive statistics relevant to the regression analysis represented in Table 3. 
The regression output in terms of the relationship between Rit and RCP shows that there is a positive significant relationship between two variables. The adjusted R squared value 52.17 percent shows the overall model suitability in terms of the dependent and independent variables. It is required to observe the relative strength and statistical significance of the co-efficient of RCP (independent variable) on the Rit (dependent variable). However, the researcher unable to find any evidence in the empirical studies to the best of available knowledge to grasp the direct relationship between Rit and RCP. The consensus price defines in the literature as the average target price forecast by all the SSSA in the market for a given stock (Nasdaq, 2018;). Thus, the researcher’s effort is to find evidence in terms of SSSA recommendations and target price forecasts and incorporate consensus price to the existing literature to recognise the relationship with stock return. 
There is evidence in the literature that SSSA forecasts once they publish affect share prices. Specifically, Brav and Lehavy (2003) state that approximately 54% of SSSA target prices realise in the actual market. In terms of SSSA recommendations, Womack (1996) finds that buy recommendations lead to a +2.4% change in share price in a short term, whereas sell recommendations lead to a -9.1% change in share price in long run. The evidence reveals that there is a relationship between SSSA forecasts and returns of securities. Thus, the researcher can reliably assume that there is a direct relationship between return Rit and RCP. 

5. Findings of the study  
Efficient functioning of a share market is critical for economic development since it gives companies the ability to quickly access capital it needed for investments through stock markets. Financial security analysts are an important element of financial decision making in the Stock Exchanges throughout the world. Accordingly, SSSA act as middlemen between investors and the stock market by reducing the information bridge. The empirical studies evidence that SSSA use all the available information in their equity research such as past price information, publicly available information and notably the private information in deriving at the consensus prices to deliver a fair estimate about future share prices ensuring market efficiency (Jagadeesh et al., 2001). 
Thus, investment banks, brokerage houses and pension funds, spend large amounts of capital to obtain the service of SSSA to generate forecasts (stock recommendations, target prices and consensus prices) for their investors. However, though SSSA use all the available information in deriving at consensus prices, actual prices might deviate harshly from the consensus prices. The ambiguous performances identify in above creates an excitement in the researcher to conduct the present study to solve the research problem, Do Sell Side Security Analysts (SSSA) act as Prophets? 
To address the research problem, twenty two listed companies selected for the period from 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2017. The number of companies qualifying for the study bounds by the sample selection criteria to limit the analysis to a realistic level. Further, in the study of the direct relationship between share price and consensus price, the researcher deliberately transforms the unit of measurement from price to return. The investigation reveals that there is a statistically significant positive relationship of 1.386 (t = 8.084) between Rit and RCP. The incorporation of RCP into asset pricing models continue the association nevertheless in a lesser magnitude. The RCP decrease from 1.386 (t = 8.084) to 0.342 (t = 1.938) in CAPM and Further, diminishes to 0.265 (t = 1.518) in FF5 model with the introduction of risk factors MRP, SMB, HML, WML, RMW and CMA in each assets pricing model. 
The SSSA are more interest in declaring favorable predictions on growth (high B/M) firms with high market risk and less favorable predictions about value (low B/M) firms with low market risk (Barber et al., 2001; Brav & Lehavy, 2003). SSSA predictions (recommendations, target price revisions and consensus prices) already reflect in the MRP and incorporation of RCP into the asset pricing model modify the magnitude of the coefficient of MRP without any change to the factor significance. However, asset pricing model significance measured in terms of adjusted R2, enhance from 79.6% (in CAPM) to 83.7% (in FF5) with the incorporation of RCP to the basic asset pricing model. 
The inclusion of a new factor into an asset pricing model is problematic for the reason that the average return describes by the new factor reflects from the existing factors and vice versa as recognise in the Fama and French (2015). Thus, in the following phase researcher’s effort is to recognise the impact of RCP on other risks factors in the asset pricing models, thus there is a significant difference in HML factor (Δ0.009 in FF3, Δ0.011 in C4F and Δ0.007 in FF5) WML factor (Δ 0.007) and RMW factor (Δ -0.014) after incorporating RCP into the basic asset pricing models. However, the researcher notifies that MRP, SMB and CMA factors are static concerning the introduction of RCP, where factor significance remains the same irrespective of the changes in coefficient values. The reason justifies in the empirical study of Barber et al. (2001) consistent with the conventional wisdom that SSSA interest in issuing forecasts for larger firms. Hence, the study sample comprises of the highest capitalisation firms in the CSE, thus MRP and SMB factors are insensitive to the SSSA forecasts concerning big firms in a portfolio (Barber et al., 2001; Brav & Lehavy, 2003). Similar reasoning is generalised into the CMA factor as well. 
Fama (1998) states: “The long-term return anomalies are fragile. They tend to disappear with reasonable changes in the way they are measured” (p. 304) known as the ""bad model problem"". In that the researcher’s effort in using prominent asset pricing models CAPM, FF3, C4F and FF5 are to test the methodological illusion in the asset pricing models use in estimation of long-term abnormal returns. The analysis reveals that it is unlikely the results generate is attributable to a poor asset pricing model. Where all the models reveal that RCP absorbs an equal portion of the unexplained abnormal return. The researcher notifies a difference (Δ) in the abnormal return of 0.009 in the CAPM model with RCP. The difference (Δ) in abnormal return is 0.006 for the rest of the asset pricing models (FF3, C4F and FF) after incorporating the new variable RCP. Thus, the researcher presumes that the argument raises by Fama (1998), “long run return anomalies to market efficiency tend to disappear with a reasonable change in the asset pricing model use” is unreciprocated. Thus, based on the findings of the study, the researcher exemplifies that there is no significant difference in the estimation of long-term abnormal returns using different asset pricing models. 
In the present study, the researcher’s exertion is to examine the relationship between RCP and Rit. Further, the researcher employs the knowledge gathered from the examination to test the abnormal return predictability, the measure by the magnitude and significance of the regression intercept. The aforementioned discussion evidence that new variable RCP absorbs an unexplained portion of the abnormal return pertains to the basic asset pricing models. Hence, the parameter estimates of the multiple regression models for the portfolio consider in the study and the time series regression analysis shows that RCP has predictive power in explaining the cross section of average returns. Consequently, the coefficient of alpha diminishes in each asset pricing model after integrating the RCP by the researcher. 
Thus, the researcher précises the findings of the study as follows; There is a statistically significant relationship that exists between the RCP and Rit. The measurement of return predictability in asset pricing models reveals that the relationship between RCP and Rit further exists in lesser magnitude even after the introduction of risk factors i.e. MRP, SMB, HML, WML, RMW and CMA in each asset pricing model. However, a fragment of the relationship in RCP and Rit represents through HML, WML and RMW factors however, MRP, SMB and CMA factors are insensitive to RCP. Based on the analysis and discussion, the researcher exemplifies that there is no significant difference in the estimation of long-term abnormal returns using different asset pricing models i.e., CAPM, FF3, C4F, and FF5. All the asset pricing models used in the study reveals that RCP absorbs an equal portion of the unexplained abnormal return. 
The sole interest of the present study is the ‘abnormal return’ measure by the magnitude and significance of the regression intercept (Fama, 1998; Brav & Lehavy, 2003; Kothari & Warner, 2007; Fama & French, 2015). The new variable, RCP absorbs an unexplained portion of the abnormal return pertains to the basic asset pricing models. Thus, the researcher believes it is more likely that analysis evidence of a market that is informationally inefficient. Accordingly, the researcher reserves the right to define ‘consensus return’ as a potential anomaly to market efficiency. 
The conclusion is drawn as to the ‘informationally inefficient market’ cannot be generalised to the CSE as the sampling frame consists of forty-four companies with consensus information. Further, “the test of private information’ is a test whether individual investors or groups have monopolistic access to private information that is not fully reflected in the market price. As emphasise by Fama (1970), “We would not, of course, expect this efficiency model to be an exact description of reality” (p. 409). Accordingly, the researcher can conclude that sell side security analysts act as prophets in the Sri Lankan context. 
 
 5.1. Implications of the study 
In a globalised world, the role of academic inquiry to discover new knowledge is significant to have a knowledge driven community. In that the implications of the present study discussed from the perspective of academics, investors, public listed companies itself, SEC and Government of Sri Lanka as follows; The consensus price is probably the next level of security analysts’ forecast, the most notable output of the financial analysis where limited attention receives from the academics, teachers of finance and students. 
Specifically, the results generated from the study contributes to the theory that it is possible to earn abnormal returns by using sentiments based on SSSA consensus price, especially by constructing portfolios using the methodology followed in the study. Thus, the findings of the study benefit the academics and students by fetching the finance practice into theory. 
Moreover, the study has important implications for both local and foreign investors. The information publishes online on financial service companies like Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and FactSet, directly impact on the trustworthiness of the local and foreign investors in formulating their investing strategies. Additionally, both private and institutional investors can get insights based on SSSA consensus price to construct portfolios that consistently beat the market and earn abnormal returns. The government plays an important role in this regard, as evidenced in the study of Antônio et al. (2017) find that the greater the government effectiveness, the greater the forecast accuracy of target price estimates and consensus prices issue by the SSSA. 
The findings are valuable from the perspective of companies listed in the CSE to formulate suitable policy decisions. The accuracy of favourable consensus price forecasts enhances the reliability of the investment. Thus, investors inspire to trade based on the SSSA consensus price and it increases the liquidity of the stock, improves the firm valuation and reduces the cost of equity of the company. Contrarily, unfavourable consensus price forecasts give signals to the company about their near future, thus the management can plan future uncertainties and better evaluate its operational and financial restructuring alternatives.
Further, there is an increasing trend between investors to invest in emerging stock markets due to higher risk and return and exploit profit through market inefficiencies. Additionally, the inefficiency of CSE provides an insight to market participants to create innovative financial products (e.g., short selling) which improve investors' active market participation and develop the CSE. Also, SSSA consensus price directly affects future share prices. Superfluous price escalation gives insight to the SEC and Government of Sri Lanka on many market ills such as excess market volatility, the possibility emerging bubbles in fast-moving companies, emerging market meltdown and recent financial crisis. Thus, the findings of the study have important implications for diverse users to formulate their future policy decisions for the development of the stock market and the economy.

Tokyo/New York (Reuters): Asian stocks hit a record high on Wednesday, as upbeat earnings, hopes of a large US fiscal stimulus and progress in vaccinations fanned optimism about a global recovery from the pandemic.
MSCI’s ex-Japan Asian shares index rose 0.8%, rising above its January peak to reach its highest level ever.
In mainland China’s CSI300 rose 1.3% to a 13-year high and the Shanghai Composite hit a five-year high on the last trading day before the week-long Lunar New Year holidays.
Japan’s Nikkei eked out gains of 0.1% while e-mini futures for the U.S. S&P 500 rose 0.35%.
Corporate earnings have been beating expectations in many places including the United States and Japan.
In the latest example, shares of Lyft Inc rose as much as 11.8% while Twitter Inc climbed 3.5% in aftermarket trading on their latest quarterly results.
“Globally investors are raising weightings on stocks as the Biden administration looks set to spend pretty much close $1.9 trillion on its stimulus,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
Although US President Joe Biden’s stimulus package faces opposition from Republicans, his fellow Democrats last week approved a budget outline that will allow them to muscle the stimulus through in the coming weeks without Republican support.
On Wall Street, major stock indexes closed little changed on Tuesday, though the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite eked out a record high on a gain of 0.14%. The S&P 500 lost 0.11%.
The S&P had climbed the previous six sessions and is up 5.3% for the month, underpinned by the prospects of the large US relief package.
The yield on the benchmark US 10-year Treasury notes was last at 1.16%, not far off Monday’s 10 1/2-month high of 1.20%.
Higher bond yields also reflect rising inflation expectations, with break-even inflation calculated from inflation-protected Treasuries rising to 2.20%, the highest since 2014.
The Fed has said it would tolerate inflation rising beyond 2% temporarily.
US inflation data, due later on Wednesday, is expected to show an annual rise of 1.5% in core CPI.
In the currency market, the dollar traded near two-week lows against a basket of currencies after sizable fall in the previous trade.
The dollar traded at 104.55 yen after 0.64% fall on Tuesday, its biggest in three months, while the euro changed hands at $1.2119, extending its rebound from a two-month low of $1.1952 touched on Friday.
The British pound held firm at $1.3822, hitting its highest level since April 2018.
The offshore Chinese yuan held firm at 6.4185 to the dollar, within sight of its 2 1/2-year high of 6.4119 set on 5 January.
Bitcoin, which gained 19.5% on Monday, stood little changed at $46,292, not far off its record high of $48,216 set on Tuesday.
Ethereum, the second-most-popular cryptocurrency, hit a record high of $1,826.
Spot gold added 0.3% to $1,842.8 an ounce after rising to a one-week high on Tuesday.
Brent oil held firm at $61.03 per barrel, near 13-month highs after a seven-day winning streak as investors are betting that fuel demand will rise while OPEC and allied producers keep a lid on supply.
“With Brent over $60, it’s been great psychologically,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. “Everyone is feeling bullish about stronger demand and global inventories in further decline.”

CBSL Director – Bank Payments and Settlements Dharmasri Kumaratunga presenting Fadna Tea Managing Director Chamendra Somathunga the LANKAQR code for Fadna Tea, together with HNB Deputy General Manager – Retail and SME Banking Sanjay Wijemanne, HNB Chief Technology and Digital Officer Rohan Buultjens and HNB Regional Business Head – South Western Region Mahinda Senevirathne

 
Fuelling the development of a robust cashless payments eco-system, the island’s most future-ready bank, HNB PLC, expanded its support to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL)’s pioneering ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ initiative with the launch of a promotional campaign for merchants in Maharagama.   
The event was hosted at the bank’s Maharagama Customer Centre and featured participation from prominent CBSL and HNB officials, including CBSL Director – Bank Payments and Settlements Dharmasri Kumaratunga as Chief Guest of the event, together with HNB Deputy General Manager – Retail and SME Banking Sanjay Wijemanne, HNB Chief Technology and Digital Officer Rohan Buultjens, HNB Regional Business Head – South Western Region Mahinda Senevirathne and HNB Maharagama Customer Centre Manager Kumudu Liyanage.   
“When compared with other economies in the region, Sri Lanka still has a lot of ground to cover in order to achieve a truly digitally empowered economy. However, since the onset of the COVID pandemic, we have seen unprecedented growth in digital payment solutions.  
“The establishment of a common standard for these transactions through LANKA QR is a clear signal that Sri Lanka is making cashless payments that are accessible to all a top priority. We therefore express our gratitude to HNB for wholeheartedly supporting this vital national endeavour, and we look forward to working with them and the banking sector as a whole in order to encourage larger numbers of merchants and customers to adopt QR-based payments as their preferred method of transacting,” CBSL Director – Bank Payments and Settlements Dharmasri Kumaratunga said.     
Following the ceremony, several merchants in Maharagama were presented with the LANKAQR code to conduct transactions by the CBSL Director. Teams from HNB customer centres in the region also raised awareness among merchants in the area regarding cashless and contactless payment options available via HNB SOLO.   
“The bold decision by the Government and the CBSL to champion QR-code payments promises to unleash a wave of growth and innovation from the grassroots of the Sri Lankan economy up. With the number of customers shifting to QR-based payments like HNB SOLO recording an unprecedented surge in recent months, we are all excited to support merchants in Maharagama and across the island to get on board with LANKAQR,” HNB Deputy General Manager – Retail and SME Banking Sanjay Wijemanne said.     
Launched in 2019 as HNB’s flagship digital payments solution, SOLO provides the convenience of digital transactions via the affordable, easy and widely-adaptable QR code, a more cost-effective option when compared to alternative payment solutions available in the market.      
Having already linked LANKAQR to SOLO, HNB is among the leading financial institutions and telecommunication partners driving a cashless QR-code based payments revolution that aims to make mobile phones and digital payments the standard for day-to-day transactions island-wide.    
As LANKAQR is a common Quick Response (QR) code standard developed by the CBSL, merchants will no longer need not have multiple QR codes for different platforms. Users can make payments via LANKA QR by scanning the code using SOLO. Upon completion, merchants will receive an instant SMS notification, confirming the receipt of payment.   
The bank has continuously bolstered the features and functionality of SOLO while refining its user interface in order to make QR-based payments intuitive, easy to use and versatile. SOLO has also provided extensive promotions and rewards to its growing user base. Additionally, the app has the option of digitally storing all payment instruments, including Visa, Master debit and credit cards, and any bank account connected to the JustPay payment eco system.        
With 252 customer centres across the country, HNB is one of Sri Lanka’s largest, most technologically innovative banks having won local and global recognition for its efforts to drive forward a new paradigm in digital banking. Over the recent past, the bank was ranked among the World Top 1,000 Banks list compiled by the prestigious UK-based Banker Magazine. HNB has a national rating of AA- (lka) by Fitch Ratings (Lanka) Ltd.    
HNB was also declared Best Sub-Custodian Bank in Sri Lanka at the Global Finance Awards 2020. 
The bank further won the Award for the Best Retail Bank in Sri Lanka for the 11th time at the Asian Banker Awards 2020, in recognition of its sustainable growth and continuous improvements in processes, products and services amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment.

Chamath Palihapitiya

 




Chamath Palihapitiya-backed Clover Health Investments Corp said on Friday it had received a letter from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission following a critical report published by noted short-selling specialist Hindenburg Research.
The company said the agency had requested “document and data preservation for the period from 1 January 2020, to the present, relating to certain matters that are referenced in the article.” Clover said it intends to cooperate with the investigation.
The company on Friday also disclosed a separate earlier inquiry from the US Department of Justice, but added it had not received any civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the department.
Palihapitiya and the company were fully aware of the DOJ inquiry, which it did not consider as “material information” for its earlier disclosures, Clover said.
On Thursday, Hindenburg published a scathing report, the title of which called Clover a “broken business,” and accused the company of not disclosing a DOJ investigation into its business model and its software offering, Clover Assistant.
The insurance firm’s shares fell more than 12%, their biggest daily percentage drop in four months, following the report.
Clover said on Friday some of the claims were “completely untrue” and executives Vivek Garipalli and Andrew Toy said in a separate blog post that the report was “rife with ad-hominem attacks, sweeping inaccuracies and gross mischaracterisations”.
Hindenburg was the first major short-selling research house to publish a new report since the eruption two weeks ago of the battle between short-sellers and investors over GameStop Corp and a number of other stocks.
Clover, which sells Medicare-backed insurance plans, went public through a $3.7 billion deal with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by Palihapitiya. Its other investors include Alphabet Inc and Silicon Valley-based venture capital giant Sequoia Capital. Shares of Clover were up nearly 4% in trading before the bell.

CEO Nalin Wijekoon




People’s Merchant Finance PLC completed another successful quarter, achieving a profit of Rs. 31 million for the quarter ended 31 December 2020 amidst the prevailing challenges in the operating environment. This continuing growth momentum is attributed to the support given by stakeholders, especially its primary shareholder, Sterling Capital Investments Ltd. (SCIL), part of Sterling Japan Co. Ltd., and the largest exporter of Japanese vehicles to Sri Lanka. 
Success is also attributed to PMF’s well-developed strategic plans and the optimistic stance taken, together with the go-getter attitude of its management team and employees.

The transformation made possible
The Chairman, Chandula Abeywickrema, is convinced that PMF’s continued transformation into positive bottom line was made possible due to the vast experience and the dedicated efforts of the Board of Directors and the newly strengthened senior management team of PMF. “It is these uniquely blended efforts of the PMF team which makes it possible for the Company to achieve such success in such a challenging environment. The banned imports of motor vehicles and the lower levels of economic activities have been tough for the Company, all our employees, our customers, and other stakeholders, as well the people of the nation,” he stated. “The Company will have to remain focused on people – from employees and customers to suppliers, business partners, shareholders, and the community. They are after all the foundation on which any business or entity is developed and expected to achieve success,” Abeywickrema says.

PMF has successfully relocated two of its branches in the towns of Kurunegala and Trincomalee to serve customers better and more efficiently, increasing reach and customer convenience.

viable has paid good dividends as showcased in the Company’s financial results for the quarter ended 31 December 2020. 
Internal process and systems development has supported external growth, and the Company is placed in a unique position to offer exceptional services and new products to the market. The corporate restructuring efforts has proved fruitful, and facilitated the cohesively directed strategy implementation. 
CEO Nalin Wijekoon states, “The operational enhancements and the efficiencies achieved in just nine months since we implemented our new five-year strategic plan is progressing very well. Our second consecutive quarter of profitability in times when people are having their personal challenges, both financially and in other ways, is a true reflection of the trust in our Company by customers and the tireless efforts of the management and staff. I am sure that we will be able to achieve what we have planned for the coming financial year and make surer strides in making PMF a renowned financial services company of the nation.” 

Strengthening core capital requirements
The Company’s planned right issue which was postponed due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, will now move ahead, strengthening the minimal core capital requirements and consolidating the Company’s pursuit of strong compliance with industry regulations and laws. Furthermore, the Rights Issue which is expected to raise Rs. 811.9 million will also improve the position of internal funds of PMF creating value for our stakeholders and positioning the Company to continue its planned investments for long-term growth. 

Setting the stage for the financial year 2021/22
Remaining true to its efforts to innovate and bring new and in-demand products to meet customer needs while supporting the Sri Lankan Government’s Economic Development Agenda, PMF has concluded its development of the Entrepreneurship Loan Product and has brought in an expert to facilitate implementation and successful launch in the coming financial year.
Enhancing reach and improving the delivery model by expanding the digital footprint is another focus area for the coming year. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extended lockdowns brought to the forefront the true importance of digital channels of delivery for extending customer reach. The Company is currently researching opportunities to obtain right-fit partners to realise their digital expansion strategy and improve their digital operational sphere.
PMF also has firm plans to improve branch network infrastructure and set up new branches across developing towns in the nation to augment service levels and make sure that people who require financial assistance have easy access to the same.

DUBLIN (Reuters): Ireland’s High Court ruled on Friday that four publicans insured by FBD were entitled to be indemnified for losses under lockdown-linked claims, in a test case that could have implications for over 1,000 similar contracts.
Irish pubs have been shut for large parts of the last 10-1/2 months due to COVID-19 restrictions that were toughest on bars that do not serve food. They were only allowed trade for a total of two weeks and not permitted to open at all in Dublin.
The court heard in October that FBD had sold the policy in question to around 1,300 publicans throughout Ireland, ranging from small rural pubs to larger urban bars. FBD estimated in July that the claims would cost 30 million euros ($36 million).
“It should never have come to this,” Noel Anderson, managing director of Dublin’s Lemon & Duke, one of the four publicans who took the case, said in a statement.
“We were forced to go through 10 months of deep financial uncertainty, significant additional risk in taking this action as well as extensive stress and strain to arrive at an outcome which should have been clear from the outset.” FBD said it was committed to paying all valid claims and would arrange interim payments while awaiting clarity on the final quantum. It said it expected the cost to be “well within the range of considered financial outcomes.” Ireland’s latest lockdown shut briefly reopened bars down again on Dec. 24 and is unlikely to be lifted until April at the earliest. In each of the four cases, FBD declined cover on the grounds that the imposed closure did not arise in consequence of an outbreak of COVID-19 on any of the plaintiffs’ premises or within a 25-mile radius of the premises.
Judge Denis McDonald rejected that argument in a more than 200-page written judgment. He said the pubs may be indemnified for losses beyond the period of imposed closure until those losses cease or the indemnity period comes to an end.
The issue of quantifying the losses will be dealt with at a later date and the sides will agree on the next steps in court on Feb. 17, the judge said.
Shares in Ireland’s only domestically listed insurer were 1.4% lower at 6.98 euros at 1255 GMT.
The ruling follows similar decisions by Britain’s highest court last month and a French court last year.
Irish Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who as business minister has introduced a number of state supports to keep shuttered firms afloat, said the judgment was welcome news for small businesses across Ireland.
Ireland’s central bank also welcomed the ruling and said it would closely examine the impact for customers of insurance firms. The regulator has estimated there are about 90,000 business interruption policies in Ireland, some of which provide pandemic cover.
Representative groups for pubs called on insurers to quickly review their policies and promptly pay all valid claims.

Net foreign selling in Sampath topped the list of non-national activity for two weeks. During the week when a one into three share split was announced, net foreign selling was 9.46 million shares worth Rs. 1.9 billion and last week the amount was 3.5 million shares worth Rs. 622.6 million. 
Analysts were mixed over Sampath’s share split move with some saying it was unwarranted whilst others welcomed it. The public holding of Sampath Bank is a high 90.6% held by 25,481 shareholders.

Analysts said Sampath Bank like several other liquid stocks had been on the sell side of foreign funds for several months. Some investors were disappointed the price gain was below expectations, whilst others said the stock lost momentum since the split was announced after the market was closed on Wednesday, and the next day there was no trading due to a Poya holiday.
However post-split announcement, Matthews fetched a higher price.
Next trading day post-split announcement SAMP shot up to a new 52-week high of Rs. 250 and closed at Rs. 201.50 up by Rs. 38.25.

Security analysts make predictions on earnings, forecast long term share price trends and try to anticipate future share prices
 

By Dewundara Liyanage Prasath Manjula Rathnasingha and Nayomi Weerasinghe

Introduction 
Observations raise a compelling empirical motivation for the researchers to investigate Do Sell Side Security Analysts (SSSA) can forecast earnings, stock recommendations, target prices and particularly consensus prices (average target prices) accurately. If so, do investors have the ability to earn abnormal returns using SSSA forecasts? 
Security analysts make predictions on earnings, forecast long term share price trends and try to anticipate future share prices. Thus, prediction of a share price is an interesting area over the past years by economists, statisticians and teachers of finance through “chartist” or “technical” analysis and “fundamental” or “intrinsic” value analysis. 
Further, security analysts engage daily in the operations of the stock market and have contacts with both the business and financial communities with extensive information, so that they have monopolistic access to private information to execute their exceptional artistic skill in forecasting (Fama, 1991). 
Forecasting is a tedious task, once an American writer Mark Twain describes it is an art, where he uses the specific word to describe it as “prophecy”, particularly in terms of future. The security analyst acts as “prophet” in this regard, they predict future states of a firm based on information, most of which are not available to an ordinary investor. However, the ability to generate abnormal returns using security analysts’ forecasts depends on the stock market definition. 
 
1.2. Sell side security analysts forecasts and abnormal returns 
 Müller-Bloch and Kranz (2014) state that there are conflicts of ideas in research findings in the empirical studies. Scholars from the domain of finance literature give insights about the different outcomes of the empirical studies done to test the ability to earn abnormal returns using security analysts’ recommendations, earnings forecasts and target price forecasts. 
The studies by Barber et al. (2003) find that investors are not able to earn abnormal return using security analysts’ forecast. In contrary Asquith et al. (2005) conclude that investors can earn abnormal returns based on analyst forecasts. Thus, the researcher recognises the gap in prior research after careful examination of conflicting arguments raised by the scholars concerning the ability to earn abnormal returns using security analysts’ recommendations, earnings forecasts and target price. 
 
1.3. Public information vs. private information 
The empirical findings suggest that investment professionals including pension fund managers, mutual fund managers and investment managers able to earn extra returns over the benchmark since their forecasts are based on private information (Potocki & Swist, 2012). A domineering argument made by McNichols (1989), states that investors have information about a firm's future earnings beyond that of its management by accessing information sources through SSSA. 
The argument suggests that security analysts possess information to foresee the future of the firm better than its management. Similarly, there are evidence that SSSA tends to disclose recommendations and target prices in favor of the management to access private information (Rees, Sharp & Wong, 2017). 
However, once the target prices or consensus prices and stock recommendations publishes online on financial service companies’ websites such as Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Reuters, Dow Jones, CNN and Bloomberg, all the information including private information gather by the SSSA eventually become publicly available to all investors in the market (Stickel, 1995; Womack, 1996). So that anyone has an interest in obtaining the information regarding stock recommendations and target prices of securities can access to the information without incurring an additional cost. 
Nevertheless, in the Sri Lankan context, Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is categorised as a frontier market by the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) and Morgan Stanley Capital International Index (MSCI). Further, the study by Abeysekara and Nimal (2017) considers CSE as a frontier market based on economic growth and development that prevails in the country during the study period. The MSCI (2018) states that in a frontier market ‘the cost of information’ is high when it compares to the developed and developing markets. Thus, in the Sri Lankan context, even though security analysts’ forecasts publish online on financial service companies, (e.g., Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and FactSet) it is costly to get access to such information by an ordinary investor. 
The validity of the argument develops by the researcher ensures the soundness of the efficient market model where the researcher needs to ask whether access to such private information pays for the average investor or the average economist to spend resources to search out the unknown information (Fama, 1970). Thus, a stock is worth analysing only when its information value above a certain minimum value decided by the investor after taking into account, the opportunity cost and benefit of including a particular stock into the investment portfolio (McNichols & O’Brien, 1997). 
One possibly will argue that insider trading based on private information prohibits in Sri Lanka as well as most of the countries in the world. However, the findings of the empirical studies do not recognise market professionals as corporate insiders (Haddock & Macey, 1987). Notably, they propose that market professionals should allow trading on private information since it creates more liquidity in stock markets and stimulates competition in the acquisition of information, thus SSSA do not use the private information to earn an abnormal return for themselves. The discussion fetches empirical evidence concerning the subject under discussion through four avenues. Thus, in the present study, the researcher’s exertion is to test whether investors can earn abnormal returns using the information contained in the SSSA consensus price. Moreover, the consensus price information can be accessed only to limited investors and categorise as “private information” in the context of Sri Lanka. 
To synchronise the variables, use in the methodology the consensus return used as a proxy for consensus price in the study. Thus, in the present study, the researcher’s exertion is to examine the relationship between the information contained in consensus return and stock return. The research question formulates to address the research problem “Is there a relationship between stock return and consensus return in the context of Sri Lanka?” with the research objective articulate from research question is “To examine the relationship between stock return and consensus return in the context of Sri Lanka”. 
 
 2. Significance of the study 
 The significance and potential contribution of the present study can be discussed from both theoretical and practical standpoints. The study contributes to the new knowledge by ‘bridging the knowledge gap’ that exists in the practice into the finance theory by arguing SSSA forecasts are comprised of or private information. 
The findings of the empirical studies, i.e., public availability of SSSA forecasts conduct in respect to developed and developing stock exchanges cannot be generalised into CSE, which is a frontier market. The empirical evidence suggests factors to distinguish between different markets as the number of investors and their behavioural characteristics, liquidity levels, legal and regulatory framework, institutional framework and market’s operational bottlenecks (Osei, 1998). The study has important implications for investors (local and foreign), stock brokering firms, security analysts, mutual fund managers, companies listed in CSE, regulatory authorities including government and academics. 
Moreover, from the investor’s perspective, the findings of the study enhance the trustworthiness of the institutional, local and foreign investors in formulating investing strategies. Investors, especially foreign investors rely heavily on SSSA forecasts i.e., consensus prices publish on online financial service companies such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and FactSet. The accuracy of consensus prices enhances investor confidence concerning the fortification of the value of their investment. The findings are valuable from the perspective of companies listed in the CSE to formulate suitable policy decisions. So, the inefficiency of CSE provides insight to market participants to create innovative financial products that improve investors' active market participation and develop the CSE and thereby Sri Lankan economy in the long run. 
 
 3. Data and methodology 
The purpose of the study is to identify the relationship between stock return (Rit) and consensus return (RCP) of individual securities. Based on that the study also attempts to investigate the investors’ ability to earn abnormal returns using consensus price and to test whether the companies listed in the S&P SL20 Index of CSE support for the strong form market efficiency. 
 
 3.1. The population and sample of the study 
A population is the totality of cases that conform to some designated specifications, which could be people, events, or things of interest to the researcher (Sekaran, 2006). The population of the study includes public listed companies in CSE registered in a reputed financial service company, which are of interest to the SSSA in their equity research studies. Thus, all the listed companies cannot be considered as the population since there are companies that haven't used in the stock market research or equity research studies of the brokering firms. 
The stock picking by the SSSA is based on the attractiveness of the stock to investors. The consensus price data is available in the research office of the reputed financial service company and for 44 public listed companies in Sri Lanka. The financial service company’s research team collects target price data from the written and electronic reports of registered brokerage firms and the system calculates the average target price i.e., consensus price and disseminates the information to required stakeholders. The unit of analysis (element) of the present study is at the individual company level. CSE is an emerging market with a small number of listed stocks (Kongahawatte & Nimal, 2015). Thus, the sample consists of all the companies of which the consensus information available. 
The number of companies qualifying for the study is based on the sample selection criteria to limit the analysis to a realistic level. The study period or sample period was from 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2018. The data availability of the sample, the consensus price data should be available for at least three months or more for a year under study, i.e., a listed company should be under a research study by any registered stockbroker for a period of three months or more. Thus, in the present study, the sample selection is based on the criteria given above, disregarding whether the firm is a financial firm or a non-financial firm based on the empirical evidence. There are 22 listed companies, qualified for the study from 2012 to 2018. 
3.2. Data collection and administration 
The data used in the present study mainly consists of secondary data sources and data corresponding to CSE retrieve from data library CD publish by the CSE. The monthly consensus price data is also a secondary data source not available to the public, store in a reputed financial service company in Sri Lanka. The consensus price automatically generates from the financial company’s software based on manual and electronic research reports of stockbrokers. 
The information regarding the constituent changes (inclusions and exclusions) to the S&P SL20 index obtains from the CSE press release data on the CSE website. The three-month Treasury Bill Rate (TBR) takes as a risk-free rate published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). 
 
3.3 Variable definition and hypothesis
The empirical studies have evidence that there is a direct relationship between stock return and consensus return. Hence, hypothesis develop by the researcher to examine the relationship postulate in the present study between Rit and RCP. Here hypothesis is H1: There is a statistically significant relationship that exists between Rit and RCP.
 
3.4. The relationship between stock return and consensus return 
 Fundamentally, the consensus price is the average target price forecasts by all the SSSA in the market for a given stock (Nasdaq, 2018). There is evidence in the literature that SSSA predict the consensus price through technical analysis, fundamental analysis and using different sources of private information about a firm. Thus, investors’ intention to purchase or sale of stocks is purely base on the SSSA consensus prices and it has a direct impact on the actual stock returns (Antônio et al., 2017). 
Rit=C+RCP+εt 
Where, Rit : Realise stock return for the stock i for the month t 
RCP : Return based on consensus price for the stock i for the month t 
C  : Constant 
εt  : Error term 
The new variable, consensus return recognises as a variable that affects the direction and strength of the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Thus, the consensus return (RCP) is the percentage change in the consensus price estimate in the month t and month ending t-1. 

Where, 
RCP : Consensus return for the stock i for the month t 
CP1  : Consensus price of the stock at the end of the month t 
CPo  : Consensus price of the stock at the end of the month t-1 
 
3.5. Measurement of dependent variable 
 
The dependent variable of the present study is monthly Rit. So, the monthly share prices at the end of each month of the S&P SL 20 companies listed on the CSE use to calculate Rit. In year 2006, Nimal uses a formula in his study to adjust the daily stock returns in the form of remittances such as dividends, bonus issues, stock splits and right issues, with the assumption that any form of remittances are reinvested at the earliest possible time in the same stock (Abeysekara & Nimal, 2016, 2017). Thus, evidence suggests that the selection of return calculation method is depending on the assumptions made by the researcher. 
In calculating monthly stock returns, the researcher assumes that any form declaration of remittances such as dividends, bonus issues, stock splits and right issues encourage investors to purchase the stock and it causes the price of a stock to increase. In general, the increase is about equal to the amount of the benefit, however, the actual price change is based on market activity. Thus, it is reflected in the share price appreciation and incorporate into the return calculation. 
Where, 
        Rit : Return of the stock i for the month t 
         P1 : Price of the stock at the end of the month t 
         Po : Price of the stock at the end of the month t-1 
 
 3.6. Measurement of market return 
 The empirical evidence suggests that SSSA do not consider all the listed companies in a stock market in the analysis and are based on the attractiveness of the stock to investors (Lehavy et al., 2011). Thus, the study confines only to the S&P SL20 as evidence suggest i.e., companies representing the characteristics of high liquidity and high market capitalisation among 299 listed companies in CSE. In the present study, the individual stock return calculates as a percentage change in monthly share prices assuming that capital gains, dividends and other forms of remittances are reinvested at the earliest possible time in the same stock. So, the percentage change in the S&P SL20 Index used as a proxy to the market return to better represent the market fluctuations. The present study sample limits S&P SL20 companies thus, it accurately represents the market return of securities listed in the S&P SL20 Index. as a proxy for the market return to better represent the stock return. 
 

 
Where, 
RMt : Return of the market portfolio at month t 
S&P SL20t : Value of the S&P SL20 Index at the end of month t 
S&P SL20t−1 : Value of the S&P SL 20 Index at the beginning of month t-1 
(To be continued)

FRANKFURT (Reuters): Deutsche Bank swung to a small annual profit in 2020, its first since 2014, on the back of strong gains at its investment banking division, the German lender said on Thursday.
The return to profit is a victory for Chief Executive Christian Sewing, who was promoted in 2018 to turn around Germany’s largest lender after years of losses and steep fines over money laundering failings and its role in the mortgage crisis.
Over the past 10 years, Deutsche has lost a total 8.2 billion euros ($9.84 billion). Analysts believe the bank is set to post another profit in 2021, according to a consensus forecast.
“We have built firm foundations for sustainable profitability and are confident that this overall positive trend will continue in 2021, despite these challenging times,” Sewing said.
The net profit attributable to shareholders of 113 million euros ($135.69 million) compares with a 2019 loss of 5.7 billion euros. Analysts had expected a loss of about 300 million euros for 2020.
Shares were up 3.7% in premarket trade.
A big question for analysts is how sustainable the profits will be. Deutsche Bank, like its competitors, experienced a trading boom because of market volatility linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, boosting its investment bank last year.
Revenue at the division rose 32% to 9.28 billion euros in 2020, while revenue from its key fixed-income and currency sales and trading business climbed 28%.Low interest rates and a slowdown in global trade pressured revenue at Deutsche’s other divisions, such as those for corporate and retail clients.
The bank has been trying to become less reliant on its investment bank in an effort to stabilise business.
Sewing, in announcing 18,000 job cuts and the closure of its global equities business in a major revamp announced in 2019, said the investment bank should contribute only 30% of core revenues. In 2020 the division accounted for close to 40% of core revenue.
Deutsche Bank ended the year with a fourth-quarter net profit of 51 million euros, against a net loss of 1.6 billion euros in the same period a year earlier and analyst expectations for a loss.

SHANGHAI (Reuters): Allianz will acquire full ownership of its China life insurance business after agreeing to buy the 49% stake it doesn’t already own in its Chinese joint venture, the German insurance giant said on Friday.
Allianz, through a holding company in China, will acquire the minority stake in Allianz China Life Insurance Co from Chinese joint venture partner Citic Trust, in a move that demonstrates the strong confidence and long-term commitment of Allianz Group to the China market, the company said in a statement.
The purchase of the stake comes a month after China and the European Union reached a China-EU Investment Agreement to promote cooperation.
“Allianz has been pursuing the 100% ownership of our life entity since the opening up measures were announced by the Government in 2019,” Sergio Balbinot, chairman of Allianz (China) Insurance Holding Co, was quoted saying in the company statement.
Allianz will leverage its global management experience, advanced digital technology and brand value, to provide professional and comprehensive life insurance for a growing number of customers in China, it said.
The transaction remains subject to regulatory approval, Allianz said.
The amount of the deal was not disclosed in the statement. Citic Trust did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In January, Allianz obtained regulatory approval to set up China’s first wholly foreign-owned insurance asset management company in Beijing, as the insurer stepped up expansion in the world’s second-biggest economy.

The Bank is committed to women empowerment at the workplace with six women in its corporate management team and many more holding senior and key positions in the Bank.
Additionally, the Bank hosted its first ‘WomEntrepreneur’ event titled ‘Vision towards sustainable business,’ in 2019 in partnership with the Women’s Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) exclusively for women entrepreneurs engaged in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The Bank also conducted a webinar in 2020 in collaboration with the same organisation to help female entrepreneurs adapt to the requisites of the ‘new normal’ after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Commercial Bank has been consistently offering non-financial services including Entrepreneur Skills Development Programs to enable its SME and Micro customers to excel in their chosen trades. Notably, women make up the majority of the Bank’s Micro customer segment while close to 50% of the Bank’s SME exposure is in ‘women connected’ entities.
Launched in March 2011 by WIM, ‘The Top 50 Professional & Career Women Awards’ celebrates the achievements of remarkable women who inspire those around them – either through the media, through achievements in their careers, businesses, and everyday lives. The annual event is an uplifting awards ceremony where the individual and corporate achievements of trailblazing women leaders in Sri Lanka are celebrated.

People’s Bank Senior Deputy General Manager Payment and Digital K.B. Rajapakse




Sri Lanka’s banking sector is successfully leading the country’s transition to a more inclusive digital economy from the cash-based economy in the line with the Government’s vision and under the
guidance of the Central Bank (CB) while capitalising on recent consumer behavioural trends emerged with the COVID-19 outbreak, the Senior Vice President of Association of Professional Bankers (APB) affirmed. 
In a recent discussion, the Association of Professional Bankers (APB), Senior Vice President and People’s Bank Senior Deputy General Manager – Payment and Digital K.B. Rajapakse asserted that the country’s banking sector recognised its pivotal role as an industry to lead the country’s transition towards a digital economy, which has become already evident in digital investments. 
“The country is rapidly transforming to become a digital economy under the vision the country’s new Government leadership. The banking sector plays a crucial in the economy in particular fulfilling needs of entrepreneurs in terms of capital funding and working capital requirements to grow their businesses, while catering to needs of retail customers and depositors and specialise for SME section. Therefore, the digitalisation drive in the banking sector is to cut costs associated with printing and distributing physical currency, reduce paper usage, increase employee productivity, efficient customer service, and finally leading to efficiency in processes and overall productivity. Therefore, we strongly feel that we have a responsibility and duty to contribute to the Government’s development agenda ‘Visions of Prosperity’ and the vision which is also mirrored in the Central Bank’s vision,” he elaborated.
Rajapakse highlighted that the CB’s QR-code based payment initiative which was embraced by the banking sector would play an important role in supporting the country’s SMEs and allowing them to play a key role in the envisaged digital economy.“This is convenient for both consumers and merchants to carry out real-time digital transactions on the spot. The small-scale vendors could save capital expenditure on POS machines and other related costs associated with it .This will also be helpful to bring them into formal fin tech sector,” he pointed out.
The banking sector has been able to get almost 170,000 merchants to this platform from large State-owned corporations to private sector supermarket chains to small-scale vendors.
Apart from the CB’s initiatives to popularise QR-based payment method among the general public and the merchants, banks on individual level are also launching their own marketing efforts. 
In addition to standard digitised products, the banking sector also launched range of digital products including products to process customer loan applications entirely on digital channels, Account opening, mobile payment apps, e-wallets etc.
Further, the association also expects several innovation products come through the CB’s FinTech regulatory sandbox. 
Touching upon the impact of COVID-19 had on consumer behaviour, Rajapakse outlined that consumers irrespective of the age, Sri Lankan consumers largely embraced digital products, in particular during the lockdown periods. 
“There was a perception among the industry that only younger generation’s keen on digital products. However, not only young customers, but also customers in all age segments utilised our products during these lockdown periods. Therefore, I believe Sri Lankan consumer has grasped the benefits of the digital products,” he added.
Illustrating an example, he noted that banks saw a record tenfold increase in retail transactions though digital channels in 2020 compared to the previous year.
Rajapakse emphasised that the country’s banking sector plans to capitalise on these trends. Commenting on the future of Sri Lanka’s banking sector, he expects Sri Lanka to make a gradual transition to digital channels, while keeping some of brick and motor channels alive for human touch.
“Sri Lankans are making a gradual transition to digital channels, unlike the rapid transition that we are seeing in Europe and other Western countries. Some of our customers still prefer the human touch as it’s important for them to build further the trust and confidence. That means we won’t be 100% digitalised and will keep our traditional banking channels open to serve these customers,” he elaborated. 
As at January last year, the number of mobile connections (excluding IoT) stood at 31.8 million, indicating 149% penetration, according to popular Social Media Management Tool, Hootsuite.
A total of 91% of these mobile connections were pre-paid while remaining 9% were post-paid connections.
Further, Rajapakse highlighted that 71% of these mobile connections could be considered as broadband (3G-5G) connection, which indicates the immense growth potential for digital banking products in Sri Lanka.
In concluding, Rajapakse urged consumers to beware of attempts by certain fraudulent individuals to scam out of their funds, in particular on social media platforms: “I want to urge customers not to share their confidential data with any third parties, because there are so many scams taking place both online and offline targeting vulnerable customers.”

Nisha Premathiratne




International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Regional Representative for Sri Lanka and Ministry of Justice Commercial Law Reforms Sector Specialist Nisha Sydney Premathiratne is of the view that a
positive market sentiment is paramount in order to stimulate investor confidence towards the share market. 
One of the very few significant positives for the country at this juncture is indeed the bullish market attracting global investors. However, if the market plummets close to 700 points in a day which some might attribute to over regulation, such would deter investors from coming into the market and retract market confidence. 
In this backdrop, stakeholders would have to be cautious when implementing rules in respect of the market, as such might send mixed signals to investors. Regulations are indeed important and the regulators globally make every endeavor to ensure that investors’ interests are protected by acting as a watchdog. 
However, there is a thin line between regulation and over regulation. Every decision has to be carefully thought of and deliberated with all stake holders, prior to being implemented. After all, if the market sentiment is negative with reduction in turnover and trading, the objective of regulation might be actually be pointless.

Fortune once again favoured a group of Ceylinco Life policyholders with a bonanza of Rs. 5 million in gold when the life insurance leader conducted the second of six draws under the 2021 edition of the company’s ‘Family Savari’ mega promotion.
This second set of 103 winners to strike gold included policyholders from Monaragala, Kekirawa, Manippai, Nattandiya, Anuradhapura, Ampara and Horana, highlighting the fact that Ceylinco Life’s rewards to policyholders reach geographically far flung and economically diverse parts of the country.
In December 2020, the inaugural batch of winners comprising 103 policyholders won the first tranche Rs. 5 million in gold. Four more draws are to be conducted this year, culminating in a total of 618 Ceylinco Life policyholders winning Rs. 30 million in gold via the Family Savari promotion. The decision to present policyholders with gold instead of the customary overseas holidays and local excursions was on account of the travel restrictions and safety precautions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In each batch of winners, one receives the equivalent of Rs. 1 million, two win Rs. 250,000 each, five receive Rs. 100,000 each, 25 get Rs. 50,000 each and another 70 receive Rs. 25,000 each.
To be eligible to participate in the six bi-monthly Family Savari draws, Ceylinco Life customers are required to keep their life insurance or retirement plans active between September 2020 and August 2021.

Ceylinco Life Senior Assistant Brand Manager Nirusha Luxshumyraj and Category Manager – Marketing Chamath Alwis with the SLIM Brand Excellence award presented to the company

The philanthropic and good citizenship commitments of Ceylinco Life were recognised by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) recently which presented the life insurance leader with a Silver award in the ‘CSR Brand of the Year’ category at the 2020 Brand Excellence Awards. 
Ceylinco Life won this award for the Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives the Company completed in 2019. These included the construction of seven classrooms, the conduct of 12 ‘Waidya Hamuwa’ free health camps, donation of a High Dependency Unit (HDU) in the Teaching Hospital Kandy – the fifth such donation by the company – and the maintenance of the previously donated HDUs as part of its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the UN for 2030.
Commenting on this accolade, Ceylinco Life General Manager – Marketing Samitha Hemachandra said: “Our corporate social responsibility initiatives are motivated by a deep-rooted sense of obligation to respond to community needs, rather than as a brand building strategy. Nevertheless, we appreciate the independent assessment of the impact of these initiatives that forms the basis for the SLIM award, and see it as a further encouragement to continue to look for opportunities for good corporate citizenship.”
The evaluation criteria for the ‘CSR Brand of the Year’ accolade included an analysis of the connection between the Corporate brand and CSR brand’s intent and purpose; the link between the brand’s vision and mission in relation to its CSR activities; the strategic link between CSR initiatives and brand intent; the impact of the initiatives and how it was communicated to stakeholders, employee engagement with initiatives, and internal marketing activities. 
Ceylinco Life ticked all the boxes in the evaluation criteria by establishing a strong connection between its Corporate brand and its CSR initiatives in the areas of Health and Education aligned with goal numbers three and four of the UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030; engaging employees at all levels across the branch network and head office and logging 5,000 plus man-hours in initiating, conducting, monitoring and completing its 2019 CSR initiatives; creating a positive impact on 2,616 school children, 3,042 health-camp beneficiaries of whom some had not previously experienced a western medical check-up, and on more than 1,700 HDU patients who were treated at the donated facility in the year of assessment. 
Overall, Ceylinco Life’s support to the nation and its needy communities is reflected in the 146,000 people benefitted by the health camps programme over the years, the 84 classroom buildings the Company has donated to date, the five HDUs and numerous other donations of essential medical equipment to government hospitals and donations last year to support the battle against the spread of COVID-19.
Ceylinco Life was shortlisted for the ‘CSR Brand of the Year’ award based on the application submitted and a presentation to a jury panel consisting of eminent marketing professionals representing various industries in Sri Lanka.
The SLIM Brand Excellence awards program is a celebration of brand excellence at a national level and a recognition of the outstanding efforts of top-notch marketers. Through this event, SLIM endeavours to not only encourage best practices in branding but also to raise local brands to global standards, to enhance the image of marketing in the country and that of SLIM in the region. This event translates as industry recognition of the motivation, dedication, and hard work that great marketers have demonstrated in making brand champions. 
Sri Lanka’s leading life insurer for more than half of the 33 years it has been in existence, and certified as a ‘Great Workplace’ in Sri Lanka by Great Place to Work, Ceylinco Life was ranked the ‘Most Valuable Life Insurance Brand’ in Sri Lanka by Brand Finance in 2020 and declared the ‘Peoples Life Insurance Service Provider of the Year’ for the 14th consecutive year at the 2020 SLIM-Nielsen Peoples Awards.  The company was named the ‘Best Life Insurer in Sri Lanka’ for the seventh consecutive year by World Finance in 2020, and accorded an ‘Honourable Mention’ as one of the ‘Most Admired Companies in Sri Lanka’ in 2019-20 by the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL) in collaboration with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), UK.

First interim target on the way to climate neutrality in the investment of policyholder funds by 2050 
25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in equities and corporate bonds
Real estate investments on 1.5-degree path by 2025 
New sustainability strategy sets ambitious targets for climate protection and social progress 

Allianz announces for the first time concrete interim targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the investment of policyholder funds, implementing its stated goal of climate neutrality by 2050. 
By 2025, emissions for selected asset classes in the portfolio of customer funds are to be reduced by 25% compared to 2019. In addition to traditional investment criteria, all equities as well as corporate bonds will in future be reviewed for their compatibility with the 1.5-degree target of the Paris climate agreement. In addition, by 2025, all real estate invested in by Allianz will be in line with scientifically based 1.5-degree pathways in terms of total emissions. Allianz will report on its progress annually, creating transparency for its customers and the public.
Allianz supports the shift to a climate-friendly economy with an ambitious sustainability approach for its business areas as well as operations. Over the next five years, the company will therefore also reduce climate gases from its operations by 30% (compared to 2019). The company already offers numerous customised products and solutions with environmental or social benefits and is a leader in renewable energy financing. “With change, we start with ourselves - to then support others to move towards carbon neutrality. We are convinced that integrating climate and sustainability aspects will have an impact on our investment strategy,” explains Dr. Günther Thallinger, member of the Allianz SE Board of Management responsible for Investment Management and ESG. “This allows us to mitigate climate-related risks and take advantage of opportunities offered by future-oriented business models.”
The reduction of the investment’s environmental footprint is achieved in five-year steps. Ultimately, companies that match Allianz’s investment profile and follow a 1.5-degree path will increasingly be held in the portfolio. This is implemented, among other things, through active dialog with the companies and specifications of climate protection targets. Emissions are also reduced by expanding investments in climate-positive technologies and by refraining from investments in carbon intensive business models.  “The past year has clearly shown: Markets and countries must learn to deal with new risks such as pandemics, climate change and social unrest. It is the most important task of the coming decade to shape a sustainable economy and society,” says Allianz SE CEO Oliver Bäte. “We will therefore intensify our partnerships with politics, business and civil society for a climate-friendly and socially just future.” 
Cross-industry and international partnerships are seen as important levers for tackling global challenges. Allianz also developed the methodologies underlying the reduction target together with partners in the UN-led Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA) network. The Target Setting Protocol, published for consultation and now finalised, is based on the latest international climate research and is currently one of the most ambitious climate guidelines for investors. Currently 33 members strong, the AOA plans to continue to grow and further establish its climate protection standards in the financial industry. 
Allianz continues to strategically expand the topic of sustainability. As of 1 January 2021, Line Hestvik will lead the Global Sustainability function in the newly created position of Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO). She reports directly to the Board of Management and will implement the new Allianz sustainability strategy in all markets. In addition to further integrating sustainability into the core business, the share of green electricity in business operations will be increased to 100% by 2023 and the use of single-use plastic and paper will be further reduced. In its social engagement, Allianz plans to expand support for disadvantaged children and young people at its sites, particularly in the areas of health, integration and resilience.

Two of Sri Lanka’s oldest finance companies, Associated Motor Finance Company PLC (AMF) and Arpico Finance Company PLC (AFC) will be forged ahead to cater to Sri Lanka’s growing financial services industry needs upon the merger of the two entities. This amalgamation of two entities will be a symbol of Sri Lanka’s financial industry strength despite a challenging environment in current global financial landscape that resembles prudent financial management skills of a family business corporation with proper governance structure and responsibility towards stakeholders.
“With two entities now becoming one as Associated Motor Finance Company, our record of resilience and fortitude will help us to tide over this challenging period to the best of our abilities and in a more resilient manner than many others in the industry,” Associated Motor Finance Company PLC Chief Executive Officer T.M.A. Sallay said adding that once the two entities are merged the entity will have a strong asset base over Rs. 20 billion. 
“With the acquisition of Arpico Finance Company, we are operating as a group with joint synergies and have diversified into three and four-wheel leasing categories by leveraging on Aprico Finance’s expertise and geographic spread with 10 strategically located branches. Earlier Associated Motor Finance PLC was operating more on a ‘Branch-Less’ model but now we will be forging ahead with Branch model to cater to a wider clientele,” Sally added. 
He went on to say that AMF benefited by way of its low-cost business model which consisted of one main branch supported by field agents who service customers located across the country in past before the acquisition of AFC. Now with the merger AMF with branches will also expected to enhance value through consolidating and administrating the operational infrastructures more efficiently while adding more value to all stakeholders, enabling the merged entity to emerge as a considerable force in the finance sector of Sri Lanka tiled under Associated Motor Finance Company PLC (AMF) brand. AMF acquired 94% percent of shares in AFC in October 2014.
Sallay further pointed out that AMF group is backed by a clear vision, with definite plans that enable them to withstand adversity, with strength to deliver powerful, structured solutions to every stakeholder that company serves. 
Meanwhile AFC CEO Chandrin Fernando said that he has great faith in the experienced Board, senior management and highly trained staff of AMF to soldier on and mitigate the many challenges whilst the well-being and financial security of their customers remains the foremost priority. 
“The inclusion of Arpico Finance Company into AMF will help us strategically serve diverse market segments while further entrenching our credentials in the market,” Chandrin Fernando said adding that AMF and AFC under AMF umbrella will be one strong entity which will be safer for its depositors. 
“It will also provide a pathway to enhance and strengthen its current capital position, complying with the objectives of the regulatory authorities,” he added. 
Recently AMF has also invested in advanced IT systems to empower the field force and to infuse greater efficiency. The company has made a concerted effort to partner fin-tech companies and technologies that design disruptive and path-breaking technologies that truly enhance convenience of customers. The AMF group is also reviewing the company’s past strategies while also enabling the merged entity to emerge as a considerable force in the finance sector of Sri Lanka.

Commercial Bank Chairman Justice K. Sripavan flanked by the bank’s Managing Director S. Renganathan (second from left) and Chief Operating Officer S. Manatunge and accompanied by members of the corporate and senior management formally declares open the new Trincomalee branch building 

Sustainability and salubrity were the operative words when the Trincomalee branch of the Commercial Bank of Ceylon relocated to a purpose-built eco-friendly building on land owned by the bank in this scenic north eastern resort town this week.
Built in conformity with sustainable construction principles that not only minimised environmental impacts during construction but will reduce the branch’s carbon footprint during operation, the new branch building is set in landscaped gardens that emphasise nature rather than the structure itself with a majority of the space conceded to the outdoors.
Located at No. 420, Court Road, Trincomalee, the two-storey edifice is fitted with rooftop solar panels that will generate a major percentage of the electricity required under a net-metering system; an overhead rainwater harvesting facility and its own sewage treatment plant that will recycle sewage into water to irrigate the gardens. All garden lights are powered by dedicated independent solar panels.
The building is designed to maximise use of natural light during daytime further reducing energy consumption and is equipped with energy-efficient air-conditioning that enhances its ‘green’ credentials. Befitting the location, a separate holiday bungalow has been constructed on the premises for the use of the bank’s staff on official visits or on furlough.
For customers, the new branch building has an ATM, a Cash Recycler Machine (CRM) and an e-Slips cheque collection capability that together offer access to cash and deposit facilities around the clock, 365 days of the year. 
The new branch building was formally declared open by Commercial Bank Chairman Justice K. Sripavan on 1 February in the presence of the bank’s Managing Director S. Renganathan, Chief Operating Officer Sanath Manatunge and representatives of the corporate management.
Commercial Bank has been serving the people of Trincomalee since March 2000 when the Bank’s first branch in the town opened at 191, Central Road. The bank said it will continue to operate the Automated Banking Centre (ABC) that was part of the old branch, for the convenience of customers.
The first Sri Lankan bank to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World and the only Sri Lankan bank to be so listed for 10 years consecutively, Commercial Bank, which won more than 25 international and local awards in 2020, operates a network of 268 branches and 885 ATMs in Sri Lanka.
Commercial Bank’s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the bank operates 19 outlets; Myanmar, where it has a Microfinance company in Nay Pyi Taw; and the Maldives, where the bank has a fully-fledged Tier I bank with a majority stake.

Ceylinco Life’s Chairman R. Renganathan (left) and Managing Director/CEO Thushara Ranasinghe 

The COVID-19 pandemic tested the mettle of virtually every business on the planet. Some went under, many are still struggling, some survived relatively unscathed, and a select group achieved growth and progress to end 2020 stronger. In this interview, Ceylinco Life’s Chairman R. Renganathan and Managing Director Thushara Ranasinghe reflect on the year that was and its lessons. Excerpts:

Q: The year 2020 was universally challenging for businesses. How did Ceylinco Life fare, overall?
Renganathan: It was a year of multifaceted challenges that tested the contingency plans of most companies. Businesses were compelled to balance the imperatives of keeping revenue generation going with ensuring the safety and wellbeing of employees as well as customers. The impacts of the lockdown continue to be felt by many companies. However, Ceylinco Life has ended the year in better shape than most. Our financial figures for 2020 have not been released as yet, but I can say at this point that we achieved a growth in all business KPIs even as we improved our platforms to conduct interactions with customers digitally. 

Q: How did the company achieve this in the face of the disruptions caused by the pandemic?
Ranasinghe: I think the key to our success was how quickly we were able to adapt to the changing situation. Companies do prepare for contingencies, but when there is sudden, near cataclysmic change, only the most agile can respond instantly. At Ceylinco Life, we had already deployed available digital technology to facilitate convenience for customers and enhance the efficiency of our sales force. We began equipping our staff with digital devices several years ago. 
Therefore, the management team was able to conduct Business Continuity Plan meetings via Zoom within days of the first lockdown in March. This enabled the company to continue with the work uninterrupted and employees were able to seamlessly transfer to working from home with laptops and the connectivity provided to the majority of them. Physical meetings were replaced with online meetings both at head office and in branches. As far as was possible, we maintained the momentum of our operations with a ‘business as usual’ approach although the way we delivered services was different and stringent health and safety protocols had to be observed.

Q: Given that selling life insurance requires close interaction with the prospective client, how did Ceylinco Life manage this dynamic?
Renganathan: Life insurance is not easy to sell, and the products can be complex, requiring explanation of the features and the terms and conditions. Therefore, we needed to do several things – develop simpler products for new customers, upsell to existing policyholders, and simplify and automate the processing. In terms of products, we promoted simple online insurance plans. In terms of processing, we effectively used our e-submission system, which makes it possible for a sales person to convince and close a sale without meeting the customer face to face and to obtain digital signatures, and for payments to be made digitally. Social media was used extensively to engage with customers, and we used operations staff at branches to inquire into the wellbeing of customers and also to assist them to revive their policies.

Q: How did the company supervise and interact with staff and sales teams in 250 plus branches around the country in 2020?
Ranasinghe: The directors continued to have meetings online with the heads of the sales team on a weekly basis. All other meetings at our head office were also conducted online. The sales teams in turn had their group meetings via online platforms, and messaging apps were used to disseminate information and updates to the sales force. The staff at head office was split into two teams to ensure work continued uninterrupted. The two teams worked at separate locations and in some instances one team worked in the office while the other team worked from home. 
The company also introduced a method where sales leads were obtained digitally and passed on to the sales force. This enabled the sales teams to introduce new business even when not being able to go out to meet customers. The digitalisation of processes in the sales function such as e-submission and the fact that sales officers had all the information they needed on their tabs enabled the sales teams to carry on with their work.

Q: What new products did Ceylinco Life develop as a response to the ‘new normal’ environment, and how did they help?
Renganathan: In the early days of the first lockdown, we launched ‘Contactless Life Insurance’ with uncomplicated Online Life Insurance and Retirement plans that could be purchased as well as paid for, via the Ceylinco Life website, offering life insurance protection or an investment in retirement that could be obtained in a matter of minutes without venturing out of one’s home. The online plans are easy to access, understand and purchase and are available 365 days of the year. 
They offer an optional Accidental Death Benefit as well as a Critical Illness option which covers 36 critical illnesses, which is the same as the standard Critical Illness Cover from the Company. The online retirement plan too is easy to understand and the completion of the process takes less than 10 minutes. For payments, we activated web-based, mobile-phone based and app-based payment options to ensure policies would not lapse during the period of curfew and self-quarantine, kept the company’s call centre active and monitored our social media messaging sites to respond to customer queries.
We also focused on upselling to our current customer base through the communication of customised quotations direct to the customers.
For speedy settlement of claims, we advised policyholders that needed to make a claim to call our call centre, which would then set the process in motion by arranging for necessary documents to be sent via email or WhatsApp for claim settlement direct to the policyholders’ accounts.

Q: How did the company manage its engagement with its policyholders around the country in 2020?
Ranasinghe: Engaging with customers face-to-face was not possible and not advisable due to the pandemic, but we made a conscious effort to ensure that our policyholders would not lose out on the benefits of such direct interactions, such as the Family Savari mega promotion or the Pranama scholarships program. Conceding that going on overseas tours or local excursions was not possible, we modified the Family Savari promotion which was in its 14th year, to provide policyholders an opportunity to win Rs. 30 million in gold instead. We also continued with the Pranama scholarships program in 2020, as a result of which we hope to present another 160 scholarships to high-achieving students in the first half of 2021. 
Additionally, we conducted several mass communication campaigns highlighting the importance of following safety guidelines and expressing our appreciation for workers at the frontline of the battle against the spread of COVID-19 and introduced a Health Insurance Awareness Month to raise awareness of the importance of ensuring that customers were adequately covered for health issues such as critical illnesses.
 
Q: How did the pandemic affect Ceylinco Life’s portfolio of community initiatives?
Renganathan: One matter for regret is that we could not continue our ‘Waidya Hamuwa’ program, which is a series of health camps in rural areas at which large numbers of people are provided an opportunity to undergo free diagnostic tests and meet a team of doctors for check-ups and advice. We have run this program for more than 15 years, but the situation in the country did not permit continuing it in 2020. We did, however, continue with our other community initiatives, including supporting regional hospitals with essential equipment. The Point Pedro Base Hospital and the Velvettithurai Divisional Hospital benefitted in 2020, and we continued with our program of building classrooms for needy schools with two classroom buildings being built and donated during the year. 
Additionally, we made a series of donations of equipment and materials related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These included a donation of surgical boots to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, a donation of surgical masks for the use of medical staff at the Jaffna Teaching Hospital, the donation of two non-invasive ventilators to the COVID-19 Presidential Task Force and the distribution of Personal Protective Equipment to 111 police stations in the Western Province.

Q: Overall, what was the most noteworthy lesson that 2020 taught Ceylinco Life?
Ranasinghe: That life must go on come what may, and being ready to adapt at the blink of an eye can be the secret to survival. Life insurance talks about the uncertainty of life and the need to expect the unexpected all the time. COVID-19 showed the entire world the uncertainty of life and how life can suddenly change. Therefore, it is important that all businesses are ready to face sudden and drastic change at any time. Businesses that are flexible and able to adapt to change very quickly are those that will not just survive, but convert challenges to opportunities.

Handing over of the agreement from Sri Lanka Tourism to People’s Insurance

As Sri Lanka opens its doors to the world once more, Sri Lanka Tourism has implemented several measures to ensure that the island getaway is as safe as possible for international guests. A medical insurance scheme is a key element of the many safety nets put in place. 
In order to provide this service, People’s Insurance, a part of Sri Lanka’s largest financial services groups has entered into an agreement with Sri Lanka Tourism to be the exclusive insurance provider for all inbound tourists.
In accordance with the guidelines set by Sri Lanka Tourism, this mandatory insurance scheme is offered to international tourists applying for online tourist visas, non-Sri Lankan passport holders, dual citizen passport holders, Sri Lankan citizens travelling with foreign or dual passport holders, as well as business visa holders. 
People’s Insurance will provide a medical cover for a period of 30 days for international visitors with effect from the day of arrival, with the provision to extend the validity period of the policy for the next 60 days with an additional premium. Adding to the convenience of visitors, extensions, claims and settlements can be initiated through an online portal. 
The policy covers hospitalisation, quarantine hotel charges and expenses for procedures which will prevent the spread of COVID-19 if the individual becomes infected with COVID-19 or becomes a close contact of an infected patient during their stay in Sri Lanka. As an added safety blanket, this insurance cover from People’s Insurance is supported by strong reinsurers from the Lloyd’s reinsurance market.
In light of this development, People’s Insurance Chairman Isuru Balapatabendi said: “Considering the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, People’s Insurance takes great pride in being the service provider to facilitate the medical insurance scheme. This partnership means much more than becoming just an exclusive insurer, as the past year has had a significant impact on the economy of Sri Lanka. People’s Insurance views this as our national duty towards empowering the economic mechanism of the nation at a difficult time.”
Sri Lanka Tourism Chairperson Kimarli Fernando said: “Following the tourism pilot project which we conducted over the past few months, we learnt that it is vital to have a strong State-backed insurance company to handle the insurance requirements of inbound visitors. Having a local insurer partner with us ensures that the processes involved are streamlined and efficient, adding convenience to the experiences of our guests. I am grateful to the entire team at People’s Insurance for working together with us to implement this program. Because of this, Sri Lanka is on its way to becoming one of the safest destinations, despite the ongoing pandemic.”
As a fast-growing general insurance company, People’s Insurance has become a strong player in the general insurance industry with more than Rs. 6 billion annual premium income, Rs. 10 billion assets and ‘A+’ Fitch Rating. 
People’s Insurance is authorised by The Department of Public Finance to provide insurance cover for esteemed Government institutions. As expressed by their vision, the insurer will continue to lead in value growth in general insurance through innovation and service excellence.

Nations Trust Bank, the industry leader in innovation, has introduced revolutionary first-time-ever features in their ATMs AND CRMs (cash deposit and withdrawal machines). This new addition allows customers to save their favourite transaction and to choose the exact denomination of cash notes that they want their withdrawals to be in.
The ‘Favourites’ feature allows users to choose transactions that they frequently engage with, such as withdrawals, bill payments and fund transfers as favourite options, allowing them to save biller, amount and accounts with options to edit favourites as required through the ATM itself, saving time and hassle for the customer. 
Users will also be able to choose the exact bill mix for their needs through the cash dispense module when withdrawing over Rs. 500, receiving the exact denomination of cash notes they chose. 
This will help them avoid the tedious process of getting cash notes changed at retailers, and further reduces unnecessary contact with individuals. The new upgrade also displays the available withdrawal balance allowing customers to monitor the daily withdrawal limit.
Commenting on the latest addition to its customer-centric services, NTB Director and CEO Priyantha Talwatte said: “Nations Trust Bank always believes in providing customers with the best possible experience through each of our product and service offerings. Since our customers frequently engage with our ATM and CRM machines, we were able to identify and facilitate enhanced features that will reduce the time spent at a teller machine and add real-time value to them. We believe that our customers look for a bank that makes banking easy for them and keeps up with the changing needs. All our core activities are conducted with a customer-first approach and all our deployments are crafted around this principle.”

NDB Bank recently assisted the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in its launch of ‘LankaQR’ in Colombo. The ceremony took place at the Waters Edge Boardwalk with the attendance of State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms Minister Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Deputy Governor Yvette Fernando and Central Bank of Sri Lanka Director, Payments and Settlements Department D. Kumaratunga. 
LankaQR Code is a method in which all Sri Lankans will be encouraged to move towards cash-less and a digitally savvy society and will also increase financial inclusion in Sri Lanka. 
Developed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, LankaQR is an integrated payment system that was launched in the very recent past at Matale. This recent event was the beginning of an endeavor to take this to every town in Sri Lanka. 
The bank is instrumental in promoting the CBSL LankaQR payment method via the bank’s own QR payment method, NEOS Pay. Customers can make payments to merchants, pay bills and perform a host of other transactions via the same platform.
Since NEOS Pay is linked to the LankaClear JustPay platform, customers can simply use their other bank account details to register for NEOS Pay. Upon registering customers will be able to avail the QR payment facility to settle merchant payments as well as bill payments with ease and convenience. Customers can add accounts of any other bank linked to the JustPay system onto NEOS Pay. 
This QR payment method will allow the customer to avoid using cash, and instead, make payments or pay bills via their NEOS App – powered by NDB, from their NDB Bank account or their other bank accounts registered with NEOS. The user does not need to have an account at NDB to use this facility, as NEOS Pay delivers a one stop payment app for all bank customers.

Fitch Ratings has revised the national long-term rating of Abans Finance PLC (AFP), a member of the Abans Group, from ‘BB+(lka)’ to ‘A (lka)’ following a revision of the National long term rating of the parent company, Abans PLC, from ‘BBB+ (lka)’ to ‘AA (lka)’. 
AFP recorded a strong performance for the first half of FY 20 / 21 amidst the challenging economic landscape due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has recorded a net profit after tax of Rs. 63.6 million for the 1H of FY20/21 period ended 31 September 2020, compared to Rs. 27.7 million recorded in the corresponding year, achieving a YoY growth of 130%. 
Despite adhering to CBSL debt moratorium guidelines and taking a day one loss on first moratorium, the aforesaid performance is attributable to the re-strategised activities which includes, timely replacement of new facilities with a time-tested asset backed new portfolio, company’s technology driven recovery and lending practices, which were more resilient during the COVID-19 period, and improved cost efficiencies implemented across the organisation. 
Further diversification of the lending portfolio into various sectors and geographic areas together with strategies used in managing the concentration risk has further stabilised the quality of the lending portfolio and facilitated in maintaining a healthy liquidity position.      
Despite the economic turbulence and the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is in line to record a comparatively higher sustainable profit in 2020/2021 financial year.

Highest ranked bank in 2020 edition of prestigious list; leads Sri Lanka’s top banks in both turnover and profit
Has been in Top 10 every year since launch of ranking in 1993


The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has moved up to second place in the latest ‘LMD 100’ after a solid performance in 2019-20 saw the bank achieving the No. 2 spot in the two principal rankings – Turnover and Profit – to reaffirm its position as one of the country’s strongest business entities.
Commercial Bank is once again the highest-ranked bank in the Top 10 of this prestigious list of corporate giants, is ahead of many diversified conglomerates and has the distinction of being ranked among the Top 10 every year since the ranking was first published in respect of 1993-94.
The LMD’s primary ranking is based on turnover, but the magazine also ranks companies by sector as well as by total assets, profit after tax, shareholders’ funds, market capitalisation, earnings per share, dividends per share and many other performance indicators.
Commenting on the bank’s ascent to No 2 in the LMD 100, Commercial Bank Managing Director S. Renganathan said: “The year of assessment for this ranking was a difficult one, even though it preceded the COVID-19 pandemic. Impairment provisioning had begun moving up, and business sentiment was affected by several factors including the Easter Sunday attacks. To be ranked the second best-performing corporate entity in the country overall is therefore an extraordinary achievement that reflects the intrinsic strength of Commercial Bank and its team.”
The LMD 100 ranking encompasses many of the country’s leading conglomerates, telcos, retail giants, insurers and other sector leaders, as well as listed banks.
The largest private sector commercial bank and third largest bank in Sri Lanka, the Commercial Bank Group ended 2019 with the performance milestone of gross income surpassing Rs. 150 billion for the first time, while at Bank level, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC reported PBT of Rs. 22.339 billion and PAT of Rs. 17.025 billion.

Kumaratunge with HNB Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer Dilshan Rodrigo as he completes a transaction via HNB SOLO at a merchant stall

 
Sri Lanka’s most innovative private sector bank HNB PLC, partnered with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to promote the Colombo-leg of ‘Rata Purama LANKA QR’ campaign at Diyatha Uyana, to raise awareness and encourage the public towards cashless payments. 
 Having already linked LANKA QR to its digital payment app HNB SOLO, the bank was among other financial institutions and telecommunication partners in joining efforts to make cashless QR-code based payments the standard for mobile phones and digital payments countrywide, in moving towards a cashless and digitally-savvy Sri Lanka. 
 “We are entering a new era of financial technology, where almost all of our daily transactions will require no physical banknotes, but just a smartphone and internet connection with our bank account integrated to a digital payment app. The Central Bank’s national directive for banks and financial institutions to adopt and integrate LANKA QR into their existing digital payment solutions has prompted an aggressive onboarding of merchants to the new payment solution across the country. With our extensive customer base, SOLO is no doubt a significant contributor to this innovative initiative,” HNB Deputy General Manager – Retail and SME Banking Sanjay Wijemanne said. 
 The Colombo-leg of the ‘Rata Purama LANKA QR’ campaign raised awareness regarding SOLO’s many facilities, including zero human interaction, efficiency, and eliminated risks that influenced many vendors to come on board. 
Since its launch in 2019, SOLO has witnessed a consistently growing customer base, with HNB continuously working to improve the app’s features and functionality by refining its user interface, enabling customers to experience intuitive easy-to-use and versatile QRbased payments. 
Users have the option of completing transactions via the app while avoiding the exchange of cash or cards. The app also provides the option of digitally storing all payment instruments, including Visa, Master debit and credit cards, and any bank account connected to the JustPay payment echo system. 
As for merchants, SOLO provides the convenience of digital transactions via the affordable, easy and widely-adaptable QR code, a significantly cost-effective option when compared to alternative payment solutions available in the market. As the app has adopted LANKA QR, merchants need not have multiple QR codes for different platforms. Users can make payments via LANKA QR by scanning the code using SOLO. Upon completion, merchants will receive an instant SMS notification, confirming the receipt of payment. 
The LANKA QR system allows banks, financial institutions and telecommunication service providers to facilitate fast, secure and affordable digital payments to any merchant or service provider through their digital payment app or platform. 
LANKA QR is a common Quick Response (QR) code standard developed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.  
With 252 customer centres across the country, HNB is one of Sri Lanka’s largest, most technologically innovative banks having won local and global recognition for its efforts to drive forward a new paradigm in digital banking. Over the recent past, the bank was ranked among the World Top 1,000 Banks list compiled by the prestigious UK-based Banker Magazine. HNB has a national rating of AA- (lka) by Fitch Ratings (Lanka) Ltd. 
 HNB was also declared Best Sub-Custodian Bank in Sri Lanka at the Global Finance Awards 2020. The bank further won the Award for the Best Retail Bank in Sri Lanka for the 11th time at the Asian Banker Awards 2020, in recognition of its sustainable growth and continuous improvements in processes, products and services amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment.

BOSTON (Reuters): The world’s 20 best-performing hedge funds earned $63.5 billion for clients in 2020, setting a record for the last 10 years during a chaotic time when technology oriented stocks led a dramatic rebound from a pandemic induced sell-off, LCH Investments data show.
As a group, the most successful managers earned half of the $127 billion that all hedge funds made last year, LCH Investments, a fund of funds firm that tracks returns and is part of the Edmond de Rothschild group, reported.
Despite the pandemic that triggered a historic stock market sell-off in March, shut down large sectors of the economy and swallowed up millions of jobs, the 20 best hedge funds topped their 2019 returns of $59.3 billion. That was despite 2020 not being as profitable as the previous year for hedge funds as a whole, which saw earnings fall from $178 billion in 2019.
The average hedge fund returned 11.6% in 2020, according to Hedge Fund Research data, lagging behind the S&P 500 index’ 16% gain.
“The net gains generated by the top 20 managers for their investors of $63.5 billion were the highest in a decade. In that sense, 2020 was the year of the hedge fund,” Rick Sopher, LCH’s chairman, said in a statement.
Last year’s biggest earners include Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global, which earned $10.4 billion, Israel Englander’s Millennium, which earned $10.2 billion and Steve Mandel’s Lone Pine with $9.1 billion. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global Investors earned $7.0 billion and Ken Griffin’s Citadel earned $6.2 billion, according to LCH data.
Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, founded in 1975, held on to the No.1 ranking since inception, with $46.5 billion earned, even after a terrible 2020 during which LCH data show Dalio lost $12.1 billion.
George Soros’ Soros Fund Management, which no longer manages money for outside clients, held on to the No. 2 spot followed by Mandel, Griffin and managers at D.E. Shaw who rounded out the top five performers of all time.
In 2020 only Dalio and John Paulson’s Paulson & Co., which earned billions from housing market bets during the financial crisis, lost money, the data show.
Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies, often ranked among the world’s most successful funds because of its Medallion portfolio returns, dropped out of the top 20 performers after the funds it offers to outsiders fell between 20% and 30% last year.
“Conditions favored man over machine and it was notable that Renaissance Technologies, a machine-driven manager, has dropped out of the top 20,” Sopher said.

To help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) recover from the pandemic and prepare for the future, Mastercard has launched the Digital Acceleration for Small Businesses microsite across most of its Asia Pacific websites with information and resources on how to digitalise and run businesses more efficiently.
As COVID-19 drives a rapid and lasting shift to e-commerce and contactless payments, the one-stop centre features guides on digital transformation, e-learning courses, information about Mastercard products and services for SMEs, cyber security insights and tools to reduce vulnerabilities and access to discounts on business software solutions, e-commerce platforms and digital marketing services.
“SMEs have taken a particularly hard hit from the pandemic, so it’s vital for them to get the knowledge, skills and resources they need to offer an omnichannel shopping and payment experience that drives business and builds customer loyalty in the physical and digital worlds,” said Mastercard Executive Vice President, Products and Innovation, Asia Pacific Sandeep Malhotra.
“With consumer buying habits and expectations evolving so quickly, this initiative is just one of the ways that Mastercard is fostering financial inclusion and helping small businesses to go digital across their operations to reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve cashflow management – all while staying safe and protected from cyber risks and fraud.”    
The Digital Acceleration for Small Businesses centre is available across Mastercard’s English-language websites for Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Hong Kong, India and Southeast Asia. It will be rolled out selectively on non-English sites in the future.
To enhance the resources for SMEs, Mastercard has joined forces with popular website builder Wix and with Zoho, a cloud solutions provider with more than 60 million users. These partners are sponsoring online guides and articles on various topics – from creating an online store and choosing the right domain name to migrating to an online expense management and accounting platform.
“As the world shifts beyond short-term survival, SMEs need to plan for long-term success in a new world of online shopping. At Wix, we’ve seen first-hand how the past year challenged businesses in so many ways but also how it brought out their resilience, grit and adaptability,” said Wix.com Head of eCommerce Marketing Liat Karpel Gurwicz. “We will draw on the collective learning of the Wix team who built our eCommerce platform and the merchants who run their businesses on it to help SMEs plan and strategize for 2021.”
“Even as organisations are trying to reimagine their business models, dwelling in rich content helps unlock ideas. We are excited to participate in this initiative by Mastercard, a company that is committed to empower businesses to innovate and implement superior solutions for business transformation,” said Zoho Corp Vice President and GM, Asia Pacific Gibu Mathew. “This initiative will further enhance and deepen digital awareness and know-how, allowing business owners and top management to make informed decisions when selecting solutions that best support evolving business needs.”
The resources site in Asia Pacific is part of Mastercard’s global efforts to help SMEs ‘Get Paid, Get Capital and Get Digital’ through new product development, partnerships and distribution channels. These include initiatives in North America, the Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand.
After reaching its goal to bring 500 million people into the financial system, Mastercard strengthened its commitment to inclusion by pledging to help a total of 1 billion people get access to the digital economy by 2025, including 50 million small businesses and 25 million women entrepreneurs.
Beyond supporting businesses, the benefits of going digital are far-reaching. Digitalisation of SMEs could add $ 2.6 trillion to $ 3.1 trillion to Asia Pacific’s GDP by 2024, a recent study by International Data Corporation showed. Due to the impact of COVID-19, it said, nearly 70% of SMEs in Asia Pacific are accelerating digitisation and 86% believe this will help build resilience against future events.
Reflecting the huge shift to a ‘digital first’ mindset, contactless payments via the Mastercard network were 41% of in-person transactions in the third quarter of 2020 – up from 37% in the second quarter and 30% a year earlier. 
With ATM withdrawals at an all-time low, Mastercard research shows more than 70% of consumers globally plan to continue or increase online purchases and that 74% intend to keep using contactless payments after the pandemic subsides. In Asia Pacific, touch-free payments are here to stay, according to 71% of consumers in Australia, 77% in India, 73% in China and 62% in Japan.

Sri Lanka has a highly fragmented banking and non-bank finance sector, which at one point in the past may have served a specific purpose of providing geographical reach. But post COVID-19 pandemic, the new norm of how we live and do businesses is riddled with ambiguity. In this macroeconomic context there is a consensus that Sri Lanka’s financial sector needs consolidation to face the challenges the new norm presents

Yes, small is beautiful. But scale is necessary. This sums up the current status of Sri Lanka’s financial sector. 
Sri Lanka has a highly fragmented banking and non-bank finance sector, which at one point in the past may have served a specific purpose of providing geographical reach. But post COVID-19 pandemic, the new norm of how we live and do businesses is riddled with ambiguity. In this macroeconomic context there is a consensus that Sri Lanka’s financial sector needs consolidation to face the challenges the new norm presents. 
The Central Bank’s recently-announced ‘Road Map 2021: Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2021,’ clearly indicates authorities’ tilt towards a market-driven consolidation process in the country’s financial sector. 
In this article I intend to make an attempt to briefly present the case for financial sector consolidation in Sri Lanka based on two points—how consolidation will benefit the country’s banking and financial industry and how it could propel Sri Lanka’s economy to a higher growth trajectory. 

From an industry perspective 
Sri Lanka always had a stable financial system and continues to do so in the present. Except for some non-systemic failures, stability of Sri Lanka’s financial system was not even threatened by the Global Financial crisis in 2008. If that is the case, one could ask why intrude with a well-functioning system? Here is why.
The most recent attempt towards financial sector consolidation was made in 2013-2014 period. But with the change in government, the process failed to run its full course. But now with COVID-19, the need for consolidation has become ever more important. 
Apart from its health risks, coronavirus has presented unprecedented challenges to businesses, economies and governments all around the world. Sri Lanka is also experiencing the brunt of the virus. The economy is estimated to have recorded a negative growth in 2020 and the aggregate demand in the economy is yet to pick up. 
Governments all over the world, including that of Sri Lanka, have extended massive stimulus packages to support businesses and reignite the economy. Central banks have slashed interest rates to extraordinary levels. Banks have also been asked to extend moratorium on both capital and interest components of loans of those affected by the pandemic. 
The non-performing assets in Sri Lanka’s banking sector are forecasted to increase after the moratorium expires this March. As per latest available data, the banking sector asset quality, as measured by the Gross Non-Performing Loan Ratio, is estimated to have weakened to 5% at the end of 2020 from 4.7% at the end of 2019 and 3.4% at the end of 2018. In the case of non-bank sector, this ratio is estimated to have deteriorated to 12.7% as at end 2020 from 10.6% at the end of 2019 and 7.7% at the end of 2018.
However, as earlier mentioned, the real NPLs are likely to be seen towards the end of the second quarter of this year, when the moratorium expires by the end of first quarter. On top of the deteriorating asset quality, banks’ profitability is impacted with margins getting squeezed, and certain banks and several finance companies face challenges meeting the regulatory mandated capital requirements. Global rating agencies maintain a negative outlook on Sri Lanka’s banking sector, largely due to aforementioned reasons.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 has accelerated the pace of digitalisation in Sri Lanka’s finance sector. The need to avoid physical contacts has made a lot of people to sign in for digital banking services. As a result banks, which didn’t have advanced digital offerings, have been compelled to invest in such platforms, which do not come cheap.
Relatively, larger financial institutions with stronger balance sheets are better equipped to make such investments as they have the wherewithal. Digitalisation improves operational efficiencies of financial institutions enormously. 
Although digital banking is clearly the future, banks and finance companies still need to maintain branches and open new ones to onboard the under-banked population in the rural peripheries of the country. 
Maintaining braches and establishing new ones is a costly affair. Maintaining a bank branch on average costs Rs. 7 million a month, with the lion’s share amounting to staff related costs. Opening a new branch needs an average investment of Rs. 10 million. We often see branches of local banks located on the high street of a town side by side offering the more or less the same services. Consolidation could avoid this duplication, thereby reducing overall operational costs and partly passing this advantage to customers. 
Also, with consolidated balance sheets, Sri Lankan banks can look at expanding to regional countries, which is the organic next step for larger Lankan banks. The Central Bank has also signalled that necessary support will be provided to large commercial banks to expand their operations into regional markets.
Let me put things further into context. Sri Lanka has a population of little over 21 million. We have 24 licensed commercial banks, including 11 foreign banks, and six licensed specialised banks. In addition we have 41 licensed finance companies and three specialised leasing companies. 
In comparison, regional banking hub Singapore with a population of 5.7 million has five local banks, while having a large number of foreign and offshore banks that operate due to its position as a financial hub in the Asian region. While South Asia’s largest economy, India with a population that exceeds Sri Lanka by nearly 80-fold has 12 public sector and 22 private sector banks in operation. 
A strong financial system is the backbone of an economy. For it to thrive it needs scale. At the same time it needs a robust regulatory structure. A central bank or any other financial sector regulator would find it easier and more effective to supervise and regulate a few large banks and finance companies instead of a large number of banks and finance companies.

The bigger picture 
The bigger picture of financial sector consolidation lies with its ability to support the economic growth of a country. Banks are essentially in the business of capital formation. They encourage people to save by paying interest and then lend those moneys to businesses to expand their operations, thereby using those savings to generate wealth. A banking sector with scale can perform this task at a larger scale and absorb more risks such as lending to unrated businesses and entrepreneurs.
Further, international trade is often carried out on credit and banks play a major role in it. Banks provide guarantees, pledges and references of their customers, bridging a trust deficit. The bigger the financial institution, the higher its influence on international trade. 
As Sri Lanka is aspiring to become an industrialised export-based economy, international trade is of paramount importance. Having a strong banking and financial system is a prerequisite for realising this goal. Hence, consolidation in the country’s financial sector could become key in helping to unleash the country’s trade potential.

Main argument against consolidation 
Naysayers to consolidation argue that it will widen the gap between the banked and under-banked, especially in the rural peripheries of the island. But is that the case? With the emergence of online banking, financial services apps and affordability of smartphone, the need to maintain a physical bank is set to diminish. 
Living in the new norm it is easy to understand that minimising capital erosion and supporting capital formation is going to be key for the survival of the economy as businesses, particularly the SMEs that provide a large proportion of employment will need extensive support by the Government and the banking sector. 
But as said above can a thinly spread financial sector cope up with the expected surge in NPLs and economic volatility once the debt moratorium is over? Can the financial sector clear the hurdle without consolidation?
In the face of possible systemic risks, State backing goes to the biggest players. Hence the answer to the question appears simple. Consolidation makes the strong, stronger, to face the impeding impairment that would test Sri Lanka’s financial sector like never seen before.
But it is important for the consolidation process to be market-driven as much as possible, due to various non-financial sensitivities, which if not handled carefully, could derail the entire process.

LANKAQR event in Colombo steps up campaign to take cashless transactions across the country








State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms Ajith Nivard Cabraal




The Central Bank of Sri Lanka in coordination with leading financial institutions and telcos in the country set in motion the ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ promotional campaign with a monumental event on 23
January 2021. 
The ‘Rata Purama LANKAQR’ initiative represents the second phase of an island-wide campaign commenced late last year to introduce LANKAQR as the standard for mobile phone and digital payments countrywide, in moving towards a cashless and digitally-savvy society plus greater financial inclusion across Sri Lanka.
Held at Diyatha Uyana, Battaramulla, the event was graced by Chief Guest, State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms Ajith Nivard Cabraal, CBSL Deputy Governor and National Payments Council Chairperson Yvette Fernando, CBSL Director Payments and Settlements D. Kumaratunge, and CBSL-appointed LANKAQR Committee Chairman/SDB bank CEO Thilak Piyadigama, among other distinguished guests.
The Colombo-leg of the LANKAQR national campaign, drawing on the participation of numerous high-profile guests plus the island’s top banks and financial institutions, aimed to advance the program’s overall vision of promoting digital transactions as the new norm and included city-wide promotions, covering major commercial locations in and around the city.
Developed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, LANKAQR is a common Quick Response (QR) code standard, and its adoption by most major financial institutions in Sri Lanka is a progressive step on the path to Sri Lankans fully embracing a future that is inevitably digital, gradually leading to an entirely cashless mode of transaction.
The LANKAQR system will allow banks, financial institutions and telcos, through their digital payment apps and platforms, to facilitate fast, secure and low-cost digital payments to any merchant or service provider. LANKAQR provides customers with a mechanism for payment for all their needs ranging from groceries, healthcare to utilities, and even the purchase of goods from street-side vendors, directly from their bank account through the use of any LANKAQR-compliant mobile payment app.
To use the LANKAQR method of payment, a customer has to scan the LANKAQR logo code affixed to a merchant stand through a mobile payment app, allowing the merchant to receive an instant SMS notification, confirming the receipt of payment. The enhanced payment functionality this offers both customers and merchants, is set to create a more vibrant economic space in towns right across the country, particularly through offering a low-cost digital payment solution to SMEs as well as informal businesses.
The aggressive adoption of LANKAQR across the country follows the national directive issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka last year, instructing the country’s top banks and financial institutions to progressively adopt and integrate the LANKAQR system into their existing digital payment platforms and apps. 
The Colombo-phase of the LANKAQR campaign created further public awareness on the ease, cost-effectiveness and secureness of LANKAQR digital payments for both customers and businesses, ensuring further momentum in realising the national vision of a smooth transition to a digital society.

FRANKFURT MAIN, AFP: A record low proportion of fake euro banknotes were seized in 2020, according to European Central Bank data, with 20- and 50-euro notes most popular among counterfeiters.
Some 460,000 fake euro banknotes were withdrawn of circulation in 2020, down 18% compared with 2019, the ECB said.
But the ECB cautioned that “the likelihood of receiving a counterfeit is very small”, with the chance of handling a fake dropping to a record low.
Around 17 fake notes were caught per one million genuine ones in 2020, amid more than 25 billion banknotes in circulation.
The counterfeit rate has fallen sharply since 2009, when 64 fake notes were found per million genuine ones. Twenty- and 50-euro ($24-$61) banknotes were again the most counterfeited notes, jointly accounting for about two-thirds of the total, the central bank said.
In recent years, the ECB has gradually given euro banknotes enhanced security features, with new 100- and 200-euro banknotes the latest to be upgraded in 2019.
Around 1.2% of those found to be counterfeit in 2020 were 500-euro notes, which is no longer issued by the eurozone but still counts as legal tender.
The high-denomination note’s removal from circulation was due to its use in organised crime.
The eurozone’s network of central banks, known as the Eurosystem, has professional cash handlers to ensure banknote-handling and procession machines can identify counterfeits.
But it urges the public to use vigilance when using notes.
The Eurosystem suggests a “feel, look and tilt” method to check for counterfeits, which asks consumers to feel the patterned print, look out for watermarks and tilt notes to see how they change visually as a way to catch out counterfeits.
It comes as the ECB is due to decide in the spring whether to launch a project to create digital euro that could be used for daily payments in the same way as banknotes.
“If and when we have a digital euro, we will nonetheless always have banknotes,” ECB President Christine Lagarde reassured reporters on Thursday.

Also wins Bronze at IFSSA Awards 2020 for Islamic Finance Deal of the Year


Seylan Bank PLC’s Islamic Banking Unit has placed Sri Lanka prominently in the world of Islamic Finance, securing the joint Gold Award for Deal of the Year 2019 at the recently concluded Sri Lanka Islamic Banking and Finance Industry (SLIBFI) Awards 2019 and Bronze for the same deal at the regional Islamic Finance Forum of South Asia (IFFSA) Awards 2020. Seylan Bank was recognised for successfully financing a Diminishing Musharaka Facility to Timex Bukinda Hydro (U) Ltd. as part of a syndicate facility.
The SLIBFI Awards, the premium industry awards for Islamic finance in Sri Lanka, are presented in conjunction with KPMG, whose key role is to ensure an impartial evaluation process. An independent panel of judges of repute assist in the final adjudications, under the guidance of KPMG. 
The IFFSA Awards recognise the high achievers in the South Asian region for their efforts in Islamic banking and finance during 2019 with industry leading practitioners from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, India, and other South Asian countries competing alongside Sri Lanka for accolades.
“Islamic banking is broadly adopted around the world and the preferred choice for some of our clients. Seylan Bank’s Islamic Banking Unit takes pride in being able to facilitate such an important deal for our client. Furthermore, this multiple award-winning deal has also placed Sri Lanka firmly in the global Islamic finance map,” said Seylan Bank Chief Operating Officer Ramesh Jayasekara.
The Timex Bukinda Hydro (U) Ltd. project transaction has resulted in Sri Lanka understanding the proficiencies and capabilities of Islamic banking and financing which has a mere 20-year history in the country. It also portrays Sri Lanka’s own management expertise and engineering capabilities in establishing hydro power plants overseas, thereby putting Sri Lanka on the global Islamic banking map. 
Speaking on the dual awards, Seylan Bank Head – Islamic Banking Unit M.Z. Sameer Mohamed stated, “We are very humbled by the recognition this transaction has received from the wider Islamic Finance community. It has firmly placed Sri Lanka as a partner of choice for future cross border transactions via Sharia compliant platforms, and also created confidence in foreign investors and other leading islamic financial institutions to obtain more syndicate financing facilities in achieving their corporate goals, which as a result would promote Islamic finance.”
Seylan Bank, the Bank with a Heart, operates with a vision to offer the ultimate banking experience to its valued customers through cutting-edge technology, innovative products, and best-in-class service.

At World Finance Digital Banking Awards 2020








People’s Bank Chairman Sujeewa Rajapakse and CEO/GM Ranjith Kodituwakku



People’s Bank has won Sri Lanka’s ‘Best Consumer Digital Bank’ while the People’s Wave App has been crowned the ‘Best Mobile Banking App’ at the World Finance Digital Banking Awards 2020. These accolades not only emphasise the bank’s success but further cement its position as Sri Lanka’s Most
Digitalised Bank.
World Finance is a quarterly magazine that covers international business, the global economy and the financial industry. The World Finance Digital Banking Awards are the benchmark for global recognition in the financial industry and People’s Bank has been honoured with two awards for the year 2020.
Sri Lanka’s digital banking landscape has become exceedingly competitive throughout recent years and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 saw an immense rise in the need for digital banking solutions. These awards and other international recognition like being crowned as the ‘Best Digital Bank’ at the Asiamoney Best Bank Awards 2020, underscore the extent to which People’s Bank’s digitalisation has been instrumental in paving the way in Sri Lanka’s digital banking sphere.  
Sharing his thoughts on these latest accolades, People’s Bank Chairman Sujeewa Rajapakse said: “People’s Bank is delighted to be recognised on a global stage yet again for our continued commitment to App technology and innovation. We couldn’t be prouder of the accolades we have achieved thus far, as it further makes clear that we are leading the way in Sri Lanka’s digital banking landscape.”
People’s Bank Chief Executive Officer/General Manager Ranjith Kodituwakku stated: “Our commitment to digitalisation has helped us achieve a lot already, and we are excited to see where it takes us in the future. This commitment and these accolades have further cemented our place among some of the world’s leading financial institutions, which in itself is a great achievement, and we could not be prouder.”

Home grown retail and household name Abans PLC recently had its National Long-Term Rating upgraded to AA(lka), following the recalibration of the Sri Lankan National Rating Scale by Fitch Ratings. This factor is a testament to the company’s ability to withstand turbulent market conditions during this difficult time of the pandemic that has seen many businesses crumbling.   
The previous year put forth several challenges that saw many industries struggling. Rather than focusing on growth, businesses had to focus on survival. The COVID-19 outbreak that impacted the entire world, caused setbacks that had never been seen before. The impact on disposable income put stress on the consumer durables market and on the value-added service industries. 
Amidst the unfavourable market conditions that prevailed, the businesses that were proactive and evolved fast – according to the changing market conditions – had the endurance to weather the storm.  Despite severe macro-economic conditions that impacted many sectors – severely deterring the spending power of a large population – Abans PLC was able to record a stable performance. The noteworthy accomplishment was: amongst the market chaos, by the end of February 2020, the company profits were well set to over-deliver. 
Foresight, smart strategy and strong implementation has enabled Abans to rise to leadership positions in many of the sectors they operate in. However, it was necessary to recalibrate strategy to ensure they were geared for the new normal, for an era driven by artificial intelligence and big data which would provide significant competitive advantage to those who were fast enough to embrace it. Abans was quick to adopt e-commerce and the channel has been leading growth vs. the traditional. The inter-connection of e-commerce to traditional channels was well understood and the continued strategy was to keep evolving the existing dynamics. 
As in the past, Abans has continued to focus on diversification that fuels growth and aids in the company’s resilience. Diversification enabled the business to continue the growth trajectory amidst volatile market conditions. The company has strategically looked to build better synergies across their various segments in order to give superior solutions to their valued customers and build on the overall competitive advantage.  
As of today, Abans PLC has garnered significant market share and established itself as the leading and trusted retail, electronics and consumer conglomerate in Sri Lanka. The company’s financial and business strength and stability has placed Abans at the prominent position of being able to pursue greater heights and achievements in the years to come.

LONDON (Reuters): World stocks racked up record highs yesterday and the dollar fell, as investors bet major stimulus from new US President Joe Biden and unswerving global central bank support would cushion the coronavirus’s economic damage.
Europe’s traders hoisted the FTSE, DAX and CAC 40 0.2% to 0.4% higher and pushed up the euro again as they also waited for the European Central Bank’s first policy meeting of the year.
With Wall Street and Asian stocks both reaching new highs overnight, MSCI’s global index covering nearly 50 countries added 0.3% to its 76% surge since last year’s COVID crash. In the US Congress have indicated they are willing to work with Biden on his administration’s top priority, a $ 1.9 trillion US fiscal-stimulus plan. Some remain opposed to the price tag, but the final amount is still expected to be worth at least 5% of US Gross Domestic Product.
“Biden has got the benefit of the doubt as far as markets are concerned and has had for some time,” said Shamik Dhar, chief economist at BNY Mellon investment management. “The benefit of higher stimulus is viewed as outweighing any negative impacts of higher corporate taxes and regulation. And I think they are right to think that. Monetary policy is also likely to remain loose,” he said.
Bond yields barely budged, with debt markets now focusing on the ECB’s meeting, which comes against a backdrop of ongoing challenges.
The bank will announce its rate decision at 1245 GMT and is widely expected to keep its key “deposit” interest rate at -0.5%, after boosting its 1.85 trillion-euro emergency bond- buying program by 500 billion euros ($ 606.30 billion) in December.
Since then, many European countries, including France and Germany, have tightened coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Vaccination programs have also been slow to ramp up, adding to the doubts over the speed of economic recovery.
“We don’t expect many fireworks from the European Central Bank meeting”, ING strategists said, foreseeing “a fairly uneventful day for the euro”, which was up 0.2% at $ 1.2135 but well within its recent $ 1.20 to $ 1.23 range. The dollar was off 0.14% against the yen at 103.37 after the Bank of Japan left its policies unchanged overnight. The broader dollar index was down 0.17% to 90.254, while benchmark US 10-year Treasury notes yielded 1.0785%, down from a US close of 1.09% on Wednesday. Wall Street’s latest highs had been helped by tech shares again. Netflix had said it would no longer need to borrow billions of dollars to finance its TV shows and movies, prompting a near 17% surge in its shares.
With the rest of the so-called FAANG group scheduled to report results in the coming weeks, Google parent Alphabet had jumped 5.3%.
In commodity markets, oil prices eased on an unexpected rise in US crude stockpiles, though hopes for an economic revival kept losses in check. US West Texas Intermediate crude dipped 0.24% to $ 53.18 a barrel. Brent crude fell 0.16% to $ 55.99 per barrel.
Spot gold rose 0.15% to $ 1,873.77 per ounce.

It will cover COVID-related tax risk management measures, tax compliance digitisation and related risk management issues, essential tax appeal features for decision making, the role of directorial boards and audit committees in tax governance, the role of tax health checks in organisational tax governance and penalties for non-compliance. The forum will further analyse pandemic-related import and foreign exchange restrictions, including COVID-related fund repatriation rules and restrictions.
The presentation will be delivered by KPMG Principal – Tax and Regulatory Suresh R.I. Perera, FCMA, CGMA.

Ceylinco Life Director Palitha Jayawardena (second from left) accepts the CMA Integrated Reporting award on behalf of the company 

Ceylinco Life’s 2019 Annual Report was ranked among the 10 Best Integrated Reports at the sixth edition of the ‘CMA Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards 2020,’ presented by the Institute of Certified Management Accountants (CMA) of Sri Lanka.
Themed ‘Derisking the Future,’ this fifth integrated annual report of the life insurance leader reflected on the strength of its life insurance products, which enable its policyholders to achieve their potential and aspirations while the company safeguards them as they progress in life. 
Ceylinco Life has adopted the Integrated Reporting Framework since 2015 subsequent to the segregation of Life and General Insurance into separate business entities under Section 53 of the Regulation of Insurance Industry (Amendment) Act No 3 of 2011, which came into effect that year. The company said its intention in Integrated Reporting is to provide a holistic view of how it creates sustainable value for its diverse group of stakeholders. 
Commenting on the award, Ceylinco Life Director/Chief Financial Officer Palitha Jayawardena said: “The annual report remains our principal medium of providing stakeholders with a complete picture of the business. Every year, we intensify our efforts to meet and exceed the stipulated standards and to further enhance transparency and the quality of disclosures. This award will provide further encouragement to the team responsible for all the hard work.”
The companies that competed for the CMA Excellence in Integrated Reporting awards consisted mainly of public quoted companies, including state and private commercial banks, finance and insurance companies, and companies in manufacturing, diversified sectors, plantations, power and energy, education and construction.
The submitted reports were judged based on the Guiding Principles, Content Elements and other fundamental concepts of the Integrated Reporting Framework issued by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), with special emphasis on criteria such as strategic focus and future orientation, connectivity of information, value creation, and reliability and completeness. 
The CMA Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards competition is organised annually by the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka, which is the national professional management accounting institute in the country. The purpose of the ‘Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards’ is to encourage Sri Lankan companies, both listed and unlisted, and state-owned institutions to undertake integrated reporting which will be beneficial to investors and stakeholders. The evaluation takes into account not only accounting and financial information, but also non-financial information provided in IR.
Sri Lanka’s leading life insurer for more than half of the 33 years it has been in existence and certified as a ‘Great Workplace’ in Sri Lanka by Great Place to Work, Ceylinco Life was ranked the ‘Most Valuable Life Insurance Brand’ in Sri Lanka by Brand Finance in 2020 and declared the ‘People’s Life Insurance Service Provider of the Year’ for the 14th consecutive year at the 2020 SLIM-Nielsen Peoples Awards.

Taking Sri Lanka’s largest segment on a journey towards a cashless world, LOLC Finance – Sri Lanka’s largest Non-Banking Financial Institution (NBFI) has introduced a Credit Card named, Savi which is exclusively designed to the pensioners and state sector employees across Sri Lanka. 
The card was introduced as a part of LOLC Finance’s overall digitisation strategy which is in line with the Central Bank’s ‘2020 – Year of Digital Transactions’ plan to promote and create awareness on digital payments throughout the country. 
The Savi Credit Card comes with a variety of offers and benefits exclusively for pensioners and state sector employees. The applicants are not required to pay the joining fee and the annual charges which makes their experience with the card much more rewarding. A special savings account with a free ATM card with zero charges on withdrawals and online transactions are among the many benefits offered with the Savi card. 
In addition, LOLC Finance has partnered with some of the country’s leading retail outlets to offer valuable discounts and offers to Savi cardholders. All offers, discounts and benefits as well as the balance amounts will be notified through an SMS, instantly. The dedicated 24/7 trilingual hotline 011 571 3333 has been set up to offer a personalised customer service experience, 365 days of the year. 
Speaking about the launch of the new credit card, LOLC Finance PLC Director/CEO and LOLC Holdings PLC Director Conrad Dias said, “LOLC Finance is on a mission to support and promote cashless transactions to all segments of the society. We believe, it is our duty to enable pensioners with a cashless journey with multiple benefits since they are the forefathers of our society. Our digitisation strategy has always been a definite competitive advantage that has placed us ahead of our peers at all times. 
“Empowered with the payment card acquiring license, we are geared to create a digitally enhanced payment eco-system, facilitating financial inclusion while gaining a reputation as a true disruptor in the traditional credit card business. Aside from forging ahead with LOLC Finance’s digital transformation journey, I believe these efforts will complement Sri Lanka’s migration towards becoming a cashless economy.”
LOLC Finance Head of Consumer and Digital Business Hasala Thilekaratne added, “The Savi card is designed to offer unmatched convenience and financial support to this very important segment of our economy. It is designed on a unique concept to attract and build partnerships with key service providers and to ultimately deliver significant value to the end user. These partnerships will be based on key verticals, always ensuring that the focus and relevance to the target audience is given priority, which in turn will give the end user more reasons to embrace the product.

Using an innovative approach to support small businesses around the country, Sri Lanka’s fastest growing life insurance provider Softlogic Life, has launched a disruptive thought-provoking campaign, ‘PinTheBiz’. The campaign encapsulates Softlogic Life’s deep commitment to enhance the wellbeing and quality of life of all Sri Lankans by embracing and utilising technology to innovate disruptive solutions.
‘PinTheBiz’ calls upon the support and cooperation of all Sri Lankans to help promote small businesses that they patronize, by spreading the word and recommending goods or services that they have consumed and sharing positive feedback. 
All they have to do is to visit ‘PinTheBiz.lk’ and submit the pin location/address, shop category, shop name and a contact number of businesses of their choice. Users can also submit entries by sending an SMS with the text ‘SME’ to 1312, to receive a text message with a link to the PinTheBiz website. 
If an individual does not own a smartphone, they also have the alternative option of sending their submissions via an SMS to 1312, with the text ‘HELP’, upon which they will be contacted via telephone by a support center representative. All entries that are submitted will be tagged by PinTheBiz and mapped on Google Maps.
These business listings will then be accessible to the public by Googling the phrase ‘PinTheBiz shops near me’ to receive a curated list of shops in their near vicinity. The initiative hopefully will drive more customers to these small businesses and is expected to spur a strong spirit of community, where every purchase made will support the livelihoods of millions of our own country’s people. 
The highly engaging initiative comes at a time of a global pandemic that has deeply impacted over a million local SMEs and in turn the livelihoods of a massive proportion of individuals and families in the country.
“Small businesses are at the heart of our communities and the key to millions of jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic has unfortunately had a crippling effect on the country’s economy, in particular SMEs. The proposition of PinTheBiz is to put our best foot forward to inspire all Sri Lankans to help those who are trying hard and support their local businesses at a time when they need it the most,” Softlogic Life Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed stated.
Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) make up a significant part of Sri Lanka’s economy, with over one million SMEs accounting for approximately 75% of all businesses. These are found in all sectors of the economy and are estimated to contribute about 45 percent of total employment in Sri Lanka.  
“SMEs are the backbone of the economy in terms of business potential, sustainable growth, employment, and technological innovation. They contribute nearly 45% of total employment opportunities to the country. It is imperative to do our utmost to support these resilient entrepreneurs to continue their operations and maintain livelihoods as well. As always, Softlogic Life continues to leverage the power of technology to accelerate growth and fuel innovation in our journey towards enhancing the quality of life for all Sri Lankan’s. Therefore, the ‘PinTheBiz’ campaign will provide a platform for people to not only engage with us but to actively be part of this cause,” Ahamed continued.
According to a recent report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the COVID-19 pandemic left a massive two-thirds of SMEs in the country reporting a decrease in demand for their products or services, while almost three-quarters reported decreased sales, with companies in the agriculture, manufacturing and construction sectors hit the hardest, followed by the services sector. Eight out of ten SMEs experienced difficulties meeting operating expenses and had some shortfall in debt repayment or ability to meet financial obligations due to COVID-19.  
As Sri Lanka’s fastest-growing life insurer, Softlogic Life is known to have led many industry-first initiatives through a blend of creativity and disruptive innovation such as one day claims settlement, worldwide cashless hospital settlement product integrating more than 60 local hospitals, offering Life insurance via mobile through a partnership with Dialog Axiata PLC a completely paperless digital underwriting solution, and a bundle of digital first initiatives to elevate the standards of Sri Lanka by bringing together world-class solutions that improve the experience of insurance for our customers . 
The company’s unwavering commitment to the Sri Lankan people has seen it reach over a million Sri Lankan lives insured through an exceptional portfolio of innovative life insurance solutions at the right time and the right place where people needed them the most. Their latest initiative is testament to Softlogic Life’s commitment to enhance the lives of all Sri Lankans, by fostering indelible growth and economic resilience within the nation.

LOLC Life Assurance, a fully-owned subsidiary of the LOLC Group, recently became Sri Lanka’s first life insurance company to achieve Rs. 3 billion Gross Written Premium (GWP) in less than 10 years. The company reached this feat during the month of December 2020, making it the fastest growing life insurance company in Sri Lanka. LOLC Life Assurance CEO Nadika Opatha talks of the company’s secret to success and its plans for the future:





LOLC Life Assurance CEO Nadika Opatha




Q: Tell us about your company’s performance over the years and what led to these impressive numbers?
Although LOLC Life was established in 2011, distribution channels were setup in 2013. Ever since, we have been growing steadily. The company’s market share has been growing consistently, mainly as a result of aggressive market penetration and by introducing a wide range of flexible and customer-centric products that are designed and developed in line with the evolving customer trends. 
The company was able to unleash this growth mainly due to its significant increase in new business building. In 2020 alone, the company recorded a growth rate of 56% in new life business, which was a notable growth rate amidst many challenges faced by the industry during 2020.

Q: Rs. 3 billion GWP in less than a decade. What is your company’s secret to success? 
We were able to reach this milestone within a short span of time because we moved away from the traditional way of doing business, to a more modern, technologically-driven approach, which is in line with the needs of the customers and our partners. Our staff and their dynamism, commitment as well as their professionalism helped us increase our market presence and it is undeniably our key attribute. These exceptional traits along with the backing of the stalwart LOLC Group gives us a significant advantage over the rest. 
Furthermore, the unstinted support, guidance and the visionary leadership of the LOLC Life Assurance and LOLC Board of Directors, helped us to perform exceptionally. I must say that as a company, we have much more ground to cover and many more milestones to achieve as we expand both locally and internationally.

Q: Was there any adverse impact on the company as a result of COVID-19?
From an economic and social perspective, last year was probably the most difficult year in SL’s recent history. However, LOLC Life Assurance remained resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic as the company was already geared with the necessary technology and infrastructure in place to conduct business as usual. We sought innovation as a key catalyst in enhancing business growth with uninterrupted service to our customers, partners and field staff. This helped the company accelerate its sales and maintained operations. 
The staff was aptly equipped with the required resources to do so.  LOLC Life launched new products suitable to the times and needs much faster and reached the market more efficiently with the support of its dynamic team, even during the crisis. Having a very effective business continuity plan too helped us to ensure continued operations nationally.

Q: What holds for LOLC Life in 2021?
In 2021, the company hopes to continue its growth trajectory with a greater regional business expansion. Further, business will be supported by reinforcing our digital transformation initiatives, expanding the product portfolio and more emphasis on our service standards.
LOLC Life envisages to expand the nation-wide reach by establishing approximately 70 dedicated insurance branches, thus penetrating new regions. LOLC Life aims to reach closer to its potential customer base in a highly under-penetrated Life Insurance market, with only about 10% of the total eligible population having life insurance in Sri Lanka. 
Furthermore, during the 2021 financial year, LOLC Life looks forward to spreading its wings to strategically selected overseas markets. The company has already acquired the license to operate in Cambodia and the operations are scheduled to commence in 2021.

Ceylinco Life has retained its title as World Finance’s ‘Best Life Insurer in Sri Lanka’ in 2020, reaffirming its consistency in performance in a year made adverse for business by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Bestowed on the Company for a record seventh consecutive year, the World Finance Global Insurance Award recognises Ceylinco Life as an organisation that is committed to continuously improving its overall processes, efficiency and relationships to serve customers better.
The accolade is based on an assessment of multiple aspects of operational performance by the UK-based international magazine that analyses the financial industry, international business and the global economy. The assessment criteria included underwriting processes and process efficiency; policy maintenance – the process of reviewing clients’ policies, appropriateness of coverage and cost per policy; exposure to risk; customer retention rate; time taken to settle claims; new customer acquisition rate and financial stability – Premium Income, Market share, Life Fund and company profits.
The judging panel represents the expertise of over 230 years of financial and business journalism, supported by a research team that worked round the clock to ensure the award winners are the most deserving in their sector. Additionally, reader insight and experience were relied upon to provide nominations. The judging panel is required to avoid bias towards criteria such as depth of practice and size of the company, in order to get an insight into different geographies and niche areas.
“The disruptions caused by the pandemic to business processes and productivity can adversely affect the customer experience, but this award reaffirms our strict adherence to best practices at all times, ensuring that customer satisfaction levels are maintained,” Ceylinco Life Managing Director Thushara Ranasinghe said. “Such consistency is achieved through continuous training and motivation of staff at all levels and an ingrained culture of commitment to excellence. We value this award because it is based on a stringent independent assessment of the qualitative aspects of performance, rather than numbers alone.” 
Ceylinco Life is the only life insurance company in Sri Lanka to win this award consistently over the years. It is a testament to the Company’s continuing commitment towards not just financial soundness, but innovation and dedication that sets it apart in efficiency, overall process management, and customer relationships.
Ceylinco Life closed 2019 with a consolidated income of Rs. 32.1 billion, gross written premium income of Rs. 18.7 billion which positioned it as the market leader for life insurance in Sri Lanka for the 16th consecutive year, net profit of Rs. 6.7 billion, an investment portfolio of Rs 116.9 billion, and total assets to the value of Rs. 133.4 billion.
Begun in 2007, World Finance magazine’s award programs are tailored to provide a comprehensive analysis of the very best in each market.
Sri Lanka’s leading life insurer for more than half of the 32 years it has been in existence, and certified as a ‘Great Workplace’ in Sri Lanka by Great Place to Work, Ceylinco Life was ranked the Most Valuable Life Insurance Brand in Sri Lanka by Brand Finance this year and declared the ‘Peoples Life Insurance Service Provider of the Year’ for the 14th consecutive year at the 2020 SLIM-Nielsen Peoples Awards. The Company was also accorded an ‘Honourable Mention’ as one of the ‘Most Admired Companies in Sri Lanka’ in 2019-20 by the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL) in collaboration with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA).
Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies and is acknowledged as a benchmark in the local insurance sector for innovation, product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.

Data suggest a fairly valued ASPI with potential further upside


By Dumith Fernando

Down 25% leading up to the COVID-19 lockdown but powerfully bouncing back +48% to close 2020; and up another +14% in value in the first two weeks of 2021. And all this in the backdrop of residual pandemic uncertainty. This is the story of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in the last 12 months.
Is questioning the persistent growth of the All Share Price Index (ASPI) of the CSE understandable? Yes, it is. Is concluding that the market is overheated justifiable? No, it is not – not if one takes the time to understand the basic facts behind current market dynamics.
Stock markets are driven by two fundamental factors – i) the earnings generation ability and the asset value of companies whose shares are listed, and ii) investors’ perception of where they can find the best relative (risk-adjusted) return for their funds. At the most basic level, these two things will determine the value of listed shares. 
For most investors, the fair valuation of share prices is indicated by valuation multiples. Price to Earnings (P/E) and Price to Book Value (P/B) multiples are most commonly used. These multiples in turn are driven by the growth expectation of a company’s earnings and, therefore, its book value (net asset value). If you assume the P/E or P/B multiple for a certain share is fixed, then the expectation of growth in earnings (E) or the book value (B) in this equation, will lead to growth in the price (P) of the share. 
Additionally, if investors compare investment options for their funds and find that other options like fixed income deposits, treasury bills/bonds, debentures, etc. are yielding less in the current low interest environment, and they expect better returns from listed company earnings, you will see additional funds flowing into the share market. This would further increase the P/E and P/B multiples, and in turn boost share prices (even for a fixed expected earnings or book value quantum). 
Both these things are happening today and supporting the advance of the ASPI. Then the question becomes, how much is too much?
 
Where is the CSE valued today in terms of P/E and P/B multiples in historical context? 
As seen in Figure 1, on the face of it, the trailing P/E at 17.7x seems 23% higher than the historical average of 14.4x. But the more astute observation is that since trailing earnings were abnormally depressed in 2020 due to the pandemic (down about 15% compared to the previous period) this multiple has limited value for comparison purposes. In this context, P/B multiples may be a better benchmark to follow. When observing historical P/B multiples, in Figure 2, it is clear that the current valuations are still at a 34% discount to the 10-year average, and also below 2012-2015 levels.
If you still want to consider P/E multiples, it is best to normalise for future earnings. When analysing forward P/E multiples based on estimated future earnings, we can further observe that the market is not in overvalued territory. On the basis of the already evident earnings bounce back post-pandemic, the valuation of the ASPI is in the middle of the historical P/E valuation multiple range (Figure 3). 
 
How is the CSE valued relative to other regional markets?
As displayed in Figure 4, the CSE has performed quite strongly since the beginning of 2020 in comparison to Asian markets like India (IN) Bangladesh (BD) Pakistan (PK) Vietnam (VN) Malaysia (MY) Thailand (TH) and Philippines (PH). However, the CSE is still valued relatively cheaper than these other markets on a P/E and P/B basis (Figures 5 and 6). Sri Lanka is not showing any irrational valuation of its listed companies when compared to other countries. It is still at the lower end of valuation multiples regionally.
The conclusions that could be drawn from this multi-country comparison may be multi-faceted and debatable. However, it does suggest that, if and when foreign investors who have exited the CSE in large numbers (similar to what they did in many frontier and emerging markets) consider re-entering these markets, the valuation advantage of the CSE would be quite compelling. The injection of new foreign buying into the CSE would support further valuation upside.
 
So what has driven the rapid rise in share prices? 
It is the expectation of both a strong recovery in corporate earnings in 2021 (and beyond) and continued low interest rates for the foreseeable future. The movement of share prices in tandem with earnings may not be intuitive to all. What do the facts bear out on the correlation between stock prices and interest rates?
In Figure 7, which plots the ASPI price movement against the inverse of the 12-month Treasury bond rate, we observe that as rates move down, equity prices move in the opposite direction with very good directional correlation. A low interest rate regime helps corporates by reducing their cost of financing, and in turn increasing business activity and earnings. In addition, investors see lesser returns in the fixed income asset class and therefore shift to the share market.
As the average dividend yield of the ASPI is over 2%, with a few percentage points’ share price movement, investors can beat the return they might get in instruments like fixed deposits which are in mid-single digit percentage levels at the moment. Finally, lower interest rates mean that investors who wish to borrow to trade shares (margin trading) also have a lower hurdle rate to beat through their share investments. 
All these factors bode well for stock market valuations. Therefore, to the extent that the interest rate environment remains benign and at historically low levels, the support for equity market valuations should be expected. 
One cannot be faulted for reflecting on how far the stock market in Sri Lanka has risen in the last eight months and wondering if it is about to run out of steam. However, before making any hasty decisions, investors would be served well to dig a little deeper – deeper than the sometimes less informed, sometimes mischievous commentators would suggest – and understand what substantiates the current market performance. 
Investors must remember though that not all shares are the same, and a well-researched, fundamentally strong portfolio of stocks will always perform better in the long-run. But the current debate on the overheating of the stock market may itself be overheated.

Mastercard and its partners move services to the Cloud, democratising access to payments technologies
Move unlocks opportunities for partners worldwide to enable contactless payments acceptance via a mobile phone


Mastercard has partnered with NMI and Global Payments Inc. to launch its first live Cloud Tap on Phone pilot with Computer Engineering Group (CEG), a California-based independent IT services provider. 
Cloud Tap on Phone is one of Mastercard’s innovative next generation acceptance products, with the software hosted on Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform.
Mastercard has been spearheading the transition to contactless payments for years. The demand for faster, more convenient, safer and now cleaner ways to pay has driven the transition to contactless, and it’s a one-way street with touch-free experiences expected to be permanent for consumers and businesses even after the pandemic ends. 
In fact, in the third quarter of 2020, contactless penetration represented 41% of in-person purchase transactions globally, up from 37% in the second quarter and 30% a year ago.
With Tap on Phone, any business – regardless of size – can deliver new and best-in-class contactless consumer experiences using a device they already own: a smartphone. 
Tap on Phone democratises point-of-sale technology by turning an Android smartphone or tablet into an acceptance device, allowing businesses to accept contactless payments while minimising the need to invest in hardware terminals or extra features. Merchants can offer enhanced and accelerated curbside pick-up or payment on delivery or provide faster line-skipping checkout in-store – options that are increasingly important as consumers look to touch-free cash alternatives.
With the introduction of Cloud Point of Sale (POS), Mastercard is enhancing its Tap on Phone product and empowering ecosystem partners to develop their own Cloud-based products with new tools and capabilities. 
Cloud POS moves key parts of the acceptance software – the components1 that enable the processing of contactless transactions and certain security functions – from the individual smartphone to the Cloud, offering robust security, reducing development and maintenance costs and creating scalable distribution channels by allowing immediate connectivity to partners. Cloud POS also becomes a new channel for Mastercard’s partners to bring value-added services to customers and businesses.
Mastercard will make its pre-certified Cloud POS software development kit (SDK) openly available, encouraging solution providers, fintechs, acquirers and processors to innovate and co-create new cloud-first products. Mastercard’s pilot with CEG represents the first live deployment of Mastercard Cloud Tap on Phone anywhere in the world. 
“We continue to see an accelerating shift to digital payments, with businesses of all sizes wanting to provide swift, secure, compelling point-of-sale experiences. Cloud POS enables us to make these experiences available to our partners with greater speed and efficiency,” said Milan Gauder, Global Head of Mastercard’s Acceptance Solutions Group. “Our partners are the centre of everything we do, and our trusted technology powers innovative experiences, choice, flexibility and certainty, creating the products they need. Mastercard’s Cloud Tap on Phone delivers on our promise of ground-breaking products and innovation.”
Mastercard has convened an ecosystem of partners to launch Cloud Tap on Phone:
Leading payments enablement technology company NMI operates as a key integration partner and distributor.
Global Payments, a leading worldwide provider of payment technology and software solutions, will provide point of sale acceptance technology. 
Continuing the commitment to empower small businesses, CEG, an independent IT services company from California, serviced by an independent sales organisation BNG Payments, becomes the first company to pilot Mastercard’s Cloud Tap on Phone.
Development of Cloud POS technology and the Cloud Tap on Phone product has been spearheaded by Mastercard Labs, the company’s new product development arm. The pilot with CEG follows live product testing on Mastercard’s Purchase, N.Y. campus. 
Cloud POS is a product of Mastercard’s multi-Cloud strategy, meeting businesses, consumers, financial institutes and partners in the Cloud with innovative applications and services. The company will conduct further Cloud Tap on Phone pilots and commercial deployments in other markets in 2021. 
Currently, Mastercard’s Tap on Phone solution is in 16 markets across Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, North America, the Middle East and Africa. Pilots are taking place with partners in Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Poland, Kazakhstan, Romania, Canada, Belarus, Russia, Turkey and the United Kingdom, among other markets. 

What our partners are saying
“Tap on Phone technology perfectly complements the acceleration of contactless payments in the US market. This is a ground-breaking step in creating a world that enables merchants to turn their smartphones into a payment acceptance device without the need of an externally paired physical card reader” – Nick Starai, Chief Strategy Officer, NMI
“The pandemic has permanently shifted the way global commerce operates, forcing companies to respond to increased demands for safe commerce solutions, such as mobile ordering and contactless payments. These waves of innovation will continue to accelerate, driving more and more technological advances across the payments industry. As an innovation leader in the payments industry, we are proud to partner with Mastercard on the new Cloud POS acceptance technology solution that will better equip merchants of all sizes to provide a faster, safer and more secure experience to help better serve consumers and their preferences for more advanced digital commerce solutions” – Jim Egbert, Senior Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Partnerships, Global Payments
“CEG is very excited with the opportunity to work on the Mastercard pilot program. We are looking forward to using the contactless tap on phone technology to enhance our service experience with our retail customers. As a technology company we are always interested in exploring ways to stay at the cutting edge of technology development for our business and our IT customers. The Mastercard Tap on Phone program fits the bill” – Eric Ross, General Manager, Computer Engineering Group (CEG).
“We have been selling and supporting a wide range of mobile POS software and hardware solutions since the inception of mPOS. BNG Payments is constantly striving to increase our support excellence, and one way to do this is to find new and innovative ways to minimise hardware and software issues. With traditional solutions, we are relying on Bluetooth or audio jack connected credit card acceptance devices that are all prone to connectivity issues between the device and smartphone, causing merchants to have transaction issues and down time. With Cloud Tap on Phone, we are reducing potential failure points to just a smartphone and data connection as well as reducing upfront cost by eliminating the need for additional hardware. This will be the future of mobile card-present transactions, and I am happy to see that merchants and cardholders stand to gain the most from this innovation” – Ryan Theis, Chief Strategy Officer, BNG Payments.

In a bid to celebrate the achievements of unique and exceptional local entrepreneurs, HNB PLC announced the launch of ‘A Banker for every Sri Lankan’. 
Launched across all of HNB’s social media handles, the campaign will showcase the achievements and journey of exceptional entrepreneurs across its substantial SME client base. 
“As a sector that produces for more than half of all GDP and accounts for 45% of all employment, SMEs are the lifeblood of this nation’s economy. Given that HNB holds one of the largest portfolio of SME clients and has the longest running engagement among private sector banks in this space, we felt it was our responsibility to provide as much assistance as possible. 
“With this campaign, our intention is to create a virtual space to showcase the journey of some of Sri Lanka’s most successful enterprises, so that we can elevate their brand awareness and help these businesses to sustain their growth, while also holding them up as an inspiration to others with dreams of starting their own business. These are challenging times, but the SMEs that can find their feet in this moment could well be this nation’s next generation of blue chip corporates. And we will be with you every step of the way,” HNB DGM Retail and SME Banking Sanjay Wijemanne stated.    
In 1989 HNB became the first private sector bank to establish dedicated products and services specifically catered to the SME sector under the banner of HNB ‘Gami Pubuduwa’.  
While extending vital financial services to underserved communities across the island, the bank also sought to empower its SME clients with the knowledge and skills necessary to sustain their businesses over generations.  
In addition to advisory services, the bank also offers further support for clients to capture business from local and export markets alike.   
As a result, HNB continues to receive local and global accolades in recognition of its efforts to leverage its extensive financial resources and technological capabilities towards delivering sustainable financial solutions to critical segments of the economy.  
In the wake of the COVID pandemic, HNB launched a Rs. 5 billion relief fund to provide SMEs with working capital support. The fund complemented the Saubagya COVID-19 Refinance Loan set up by the government to assist enterprises.   
Applicants who were unable to secure government-funded loans were offered the option of securing a working capital loan from the HNB COVID relief fund at a concessionary interest rate. 
In this manner, HNB utilised its own internally generated funds to support Government objectives of ensuring that as many viable SMEs are provided priority access to funding to support them through the disruptions caused by the pandemic.  
Recently, the bank also announced a landmark agreement with Proparco, the private sector funding arm of the French development bank, Agence Française de Développement (AFD), to secure $ 60 million in funding for SMEs.  
Given the bank’s role as a proven leader in technological innovation, HNB was able to extend prompt support in the form of comprehensive digital banking services to guarantee uninterrupted service to the sector throughout the lockdown period. These include its low-cost Bluetooth enabled card payment devices, MOMO, and HNB SOLO – the pioneering QR-code based mobile payments app that provides users with the ability to safely and securely enter into contactless transactions.  
Additionally, the bank fast-tracked development of services like Appi Go – a platform facilitating businesses with end-to-end e-commerce capabilities – enabling businesses to join a plug-and-play e-commerce revolution taking place across Sri Lanka.  
With 252 customer centres across the country, HNB is one of Sri Lanka’s largest, most technologically innovative banks having won local and global recognition for its efforts to drive forward a new paradigm in digital banking. Over the recent past, the bank was ranked among the World Top 1,000 Banks list compiled by the prestigious UK-based Banker Magazine. HNB’s long-term national rating was revised upward by two notches to AA+ (lka) recently by Fitch Ratings (Lanka) Ltd.

To boost entrepreneurship islandwide and uplift national economy


The landmark tie-up between SDB bank and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) was set in motion last month, with a focused entrepreneurship development and business mentorship session, bringing together SDB bank’s SME and Co-op customers from the Galle region plus officials from both organisations.
An industry-first collaborative effort, formalised through an MoU entered into between both parties in November, it aims to boost the island’s SME and Co-op sectors and thereby support national economic development, through a suite of dedicated financial and business acumen solutions plus active professional mentorship.
The initiative’s launch in Galle involved many SME participants selected across regional SDB bank branches, along with a group of the bank’s regional co-op society customers. 
Speaking at the inaugural event in Galle, SDB bank Chairman Lakshman Abeysekera said, “It is heartening to see the eager participation of SME and co-operative customers from SDB bank, and how motivated they are to make full use of this one-of-a-kind business development and professional mentorship opportunity.”
During the session, participants were offered practical knowledge and guidance on topics ranging from accounting, business planning, and management, to recruitment, HR and taxation. Additionally, they were given professional advice on areas such as expansion and diversification, exposing them to business practices and models that would help them scale business gradually.
SDB bank CEO Thilak Piyadigama added, “As the apex bank of the co-operative sector and a leading partner of national development, this collaborative development and mentorship effort between SDB bank and CA Sri Lanka represents an industry landmark for us, as it will help foster high-potential, business-savvy SMEs in strengthening our national economy considerably.”
At the kickoff event in Galle, considerable time was spent to identify constraints and obstacles experienced by these SME and Co-op customers. Parallel to such group knowledge sharing sessions to be held routinely, one-on-one meetings with individual participants will now commence in addressing their specific issues and to guide them closely on business processes. The program will be similarly launched across other SDB bank regions and branches, one-by-one.
CA Sri Lanka President Manil Jayesinghe stated, “Today’s event is of great importance to not only the participants but to the entire country, as SMEs contribute to over 50% of our national GDP, and the support we will extend to them together with SDB bank, whether in accessing money or the management of their businesses, will help them grow and overcome obstacles faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ultimately uplifting our country and the national economy.”
The unique collaborative development program will work to ensure that the island’s entrepreneurs, whether from small villages or busy townships, are presented with the best opportunities to advance their businesses, be export-ready, and support the national economy. 
Additionally, a range of opportunities will be made available to SDB bank’s SME-sector customers through this program, from access to new markets, and technology updates, to exploring innovative business avenues. It is expected that agreements between CA Sri Lanka and Government organisations including the UGC (University Grants Commission), EDB (Sri Lanka Export Development Board), and NEDA (National Enterprise Development Authority), will aid these efforts.

AIA Sri Lanka chooses Microsoft 365, Teams, and Azure to streamline insurance processes amidst COVID-19


As technology reshapes the insurance industry, AIA Sri Lanka recognises that a cloud-first strategy is critical to the company’s ambition to become agile in all support processes while improving the business model so that the company is primed for innovation. Over 4,900 employees and agents across 107 offices now use Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams as a unified environment for collaboration and teamwork. 
“Our use of Microsoft solutions, such as Teams, has enabled us to stay connected with colleagues across Asia and collaborate without any disruptions,” said AIA Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Nikhil Advani. “It paid off when the Government imposed a nationwide curfew to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We smoothly transitioned into the ‘work from home’ way of doing things, with our staff effectively using the technologies for meetings and presentations.”
AIA Sri Lanka will also adopt Microsoft Azure as a preferred cloud platform to meet the company’s need for resilient data centres and cloud services and addressing customers’ security, privacy, and compliance requirements.
“Our transition during the pandemic incurred almost zero downtime for our employees and customers, even with the imposed curfew,” said AIA Sri Lanka Chief Technology Officer and Director of Information Technology Umeshi de Fonseka. “We were contactable from day one because we had the right cloud tools and technologies deployed. We have a very aggressive cloud strategy on Microsoft Azure. We just finished deploying our Azure data lake—which, I believe, is a first in Sri Lanka for something of this scale. We’re also working with a partner for other cutting-edge Azure-based solutions and multiple AI-powered initiatives, such as chatbots and predictive analytics.” 
AIA Sri Lanka strives to understand the evolving needs of its communities and be an enabler for change. As a part of the strategic partnership, the company and Microsoft will explore sustainable insurance and business initiatives to expand sustainability across the industry.
“AIA Sri Lanka is setting the standards for insurance companies in the region,” said Microsoft Sri Lanka and Maldives Country Manager Hasitha Abeywardena. “Our cloud platform and collaboration tools enable insurance companies to gain the agility they need to respond to competitive pressures, regulatory environments and customer demand. Microsoft is committed to helping AIA Sri Lanka in its ongoing digital transformation journey.”

CBSL holdings also recorded an all-time high amount of Rs. 885 billion on 30 December 2020


Ahead of the January monetary policy review by the Central Bank, First Capital yesterday predicted policy rates to hold steady amidst sweeping measures to insulate the economy. 
“In-line with our expectations, at the previous policy meeting held on November 2020, CBSL maintained its monetary policy stance, emphasising the fact that overall market lending rates have witnessed a reduction during 2020 and there is a need for a continued downward adjustment in lending rates to boost economic growth. Moreover, introduction of maximum interest rates on mortgage-backed housing loans is expected to provide additional stimulus to the economy,” First Capital said.
Listing arguments against further relaxation in monetary policy, First Capital said excess liquidity prevailing in the domestic market requires no change in current policy stance.
“As a response to the measures taken by the Government, market liquidity increased to an elevated level while recording a three-year high on 1 January 2021 amounting to Rs. 266.5 billion. Accordingly, this excess liquidity in the system is expected to retain market interest rates at single digit levels while inducing further credit expansion. This inquires the need of further policy easing at the upcoming review,” it said. 
Another argument is that the gradual rebound in private credit to power economic growth.
“Private sector credit increased by Rs. 41 billion  in November 2020 recording a growth for the fourth consecutive month indicating a revival in gross loan disbursements up to pre-pandemic levels in December 2019. The continuous uptrend in private sector credit till November 2020 reflects that both businesses and individuals are accelerating their economic activities to make up for the lost opportunities during lockdowns in the first wave of COVID, which could power decent growth in 4Q2020 and onwards,” First Capital explained. 
Rock bottom interest rates will gear up the economy as well, it said. 
“In response to previous monetary easing measures implemented by CBSL, (including the lending caps) to bring down costs of borrowing of businesses and households, both market deposit and lending rates adjusted notably so far during 2020. We believe these measures will enable to maintain market interest rates at stable levels in 2021 while playing its aiding role amidst the pandemic driven economic contraction,” it said. 
First Capital said amidst the world on a money printing spree, CBSL holdings also recorded an all-time high amount of Rs. 885 billion on 30 December 2020 as a result of printed money by the Government, in order to finance the fiscal deficit. “We expect the injected cash via money printing may result in increased money supply and create demand driven inflationary pressures with the recovery of economic activities. Therefore, further policy easing at the upcoming policy review is unlikely as further easing of monetary measures could result in an overheated economy,” First Capital said. 
It also listed arguments for further relaxation in monetary policy. 
One was growth-oriented endeavours. “We estimate that GDP would see its steepest contraction in history of -5.8% in 2020 and to see a gradual recovery of 2.8% in 2021. The current Government’s key drive is the development oriented economic growth which was spelled out through the Budget 2021 and is in the process of changing gears of the economy from a recovery phase to an expansion phase. Accordingly, Government plans to reach 6% and above GDP growth during the next five years commencing from 2021. As we believe a development-oriented budget coupled with low interest rate environment can support the Government’s medium-term goals. Therefore, the need to accelerate the GDP growth can be considered as a major factor favouring further policy easing at the upcoming review.
Access to less expensive domestic funding is another argument, First Capital said. 
“It is reasonable to assume that Government is more focused on domestic funding to finance the budget deficit. This is reflected by the improved domestic to foreign debt ratio to 54:46 by end July 2020 from the previous 51:49 as at end of 2019. In the midst of limited access to the international financial markets, Government opt to rely more on domestic borrowings to finance the budget deficit and hence easing rates at the upcoming policy meeting results in reduced funding cost favouring the Government,” it added.

In parallel to this pandemic-stricken year in which time often seemed to stand still, businesses rapidly went digital and made structural changes to their payments operating models. Global economies moved quickly in ways that accelerated change, bringing lasting impact to consumer behaviour, fraud patterns and risk mitigation needs.
Consumers adopted new shopping behaviours and digital habits during the crisis. We at Visa utilised our expertise and resources to help financial institutions, merchant partners, governments, and consumers to navigate during these unprecedented times. Looking ahead to next year, we believe many of the changes in digital payments will carry over. More importantly, the experiences of this year will accelerate innovation and force companies to ensure their mistakes are not repeated in 2021. A few predictions for 2021 include:

Small businesses to increase investments in cybersecurity as consumers shift to digital
The flight to digital by new consumers was noticed early on by businesses. As per a Deloitte report,1 48% of consumers reported that overall online spending had increased since the outbreak of COVID-19. These consumer behaviours will be instrumental for small businesses to innovate and meet customer expectations on security. Merchants who invested in new strategies to onboard customers and new ways to pay, either online, in-app or contactless will be rewarded through new customer acquisitions, existing customer retention and growth in sales. 
But as merchants and consumers move online, so are cyber criminals. Small businesses will need to update their fraud prevention strategies to support omnichannel commerce. A sure shot way is for small businesses to turn to reputable partners that can provide payment security aligned to their business goals and interests.

Combating risk and security in modern payment infrastructures
Advances in payment innovation between fintechs and established financial institutions have led to widescale adoption of digital payments. Businesses are modernising legacy payment infrastructure and quickly embracing new, faster ways to send money, settle payments and share information, also by relying on new players like fintechs. Real time payments, digital currency and open banking support innovation that match the expectations of digitally savvy businesses and will subsequently drive digital commerce for decades to come. It is critical for businesses to be mindful of customer data privacy and the principles of open banking by sharing data ethically and correctly across all their functions.
Fintech and financial institutions need to have improved mechanisms to spot potential and atypical fraud activities. 2021 will be crucial for growth in volume of real time payments; industry discussions on customer protection and data privacy will be at the forefront and industry players working together to resolve new vulnerabilities as they are revealed. 

Strong customer authentication to become important
As financial transactions continue to be digitised in Bangladesh, critical challenges in mitigating cyber-security risks have risen too, with the growing number of new-to-digital consumers. To safeguard themselves from vulnerabilities, consumers are moving away from passwords and adopting stronger customer authentication standards across their digital devices while making payments. 
According to World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2020,2 data theft is one of the top risks that businesses are likely to face in the long term. Accelerated by COVID-19, demand for solutions that help businesses to digitally verify consumer identity will grow. Reviewing and further strengthening the existing compliance and regulatory framework by the regulator during these transformative times will become even more important. The concept that digital identity is one of the building blocks required for an economy to function in the digital age will gain further traction in 2021.

Increase in role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as new-to-digital consumers abound
Digital experiences continue to become mainstream with the pandemic providing a fillip. The world financial system is moving closer to a digital, cashless future and with a rise in online consumption; 2021 will witness a surge in a new generation of digital customers.
Visa has been using AI since the 1990s as part of its mission to make payments safer and easier.
When an attempted payment is initiated at a merchant, Visa’s Advanced Authorisation uses AI to analyse more than 500 risk attributes in approximately a 
millisecond3 and produce a score that reflects how risky the transaction is. The goal is to help financial institutions decide whether to authorise or decline a given transaction and at the same time create more confidence among consumers in digital payments. This use of AI is helping companies around the world improve customer experience, drive business growth and mitigate the threats to payment security.
To provide a secure payment experience while monitoring an exponential increase in transactions, we believe that more financial service providers will build new payment security solutions applying technologies such as AI and ML to automate risk detection. In the recent past, such technologies were vital in creating payment security solutions such as EMV 3DS, tokenisation and deployment of many capabilities to strengthen real-time payment fraud monitoring. AI and ML will be instrumental in preventing payment risks in this time of increasing cybersecurity risks.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka recently issued a statement on penalties imposed against several financial institutions, including Softlogic Finance PLC for non-compliance with regulatory requirements during the second half of 2020. 
Softlogic Finance in a statement yesterday said it wishes to clarify that the fine imposed by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Central Bank was due to a shortcoming in the core operating system of the company in relation to screening the United Nations Sanctions List. This procedural shortcoming was met by Softlogic Finance in October 2020, and the system updated according to the directives stipulated by the Central Bank.
“Softlogic Finance PLC is committed to upholding effective anti-money laundering standards, and as a responsible corporate entity, has established an Anti-Money Laundering Policy to ensure the identification and mitigation of money laundering risks. The company further reiterates its continued commitment to fully comply with all regulatory directives by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka,” the statement by the company added.

Seylan Bank Assistant General Manager - Marketing and Sales Gamika De Silva




Seylan Bank PLC, the bank with a heart, has been named the most popular banking service provider in Sri Lanka in the exclusive customer experience ranking announced by LMD, for the second consecutive year. 
The ranking is based on a survey of Sri Lankan consumers on their most preferred brands across 18 sectors in terms of customer satisfaction and their perception of service quality, in a year full of challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.
The customer excellence rankings published in the most recent edition of the LMD magazine, were the result of an extensive online survey undertaken in the third quarter of 2020, in which participants voted for their most preferred service brands in the country. Most notably, Seylan Bank was ranked number one by customers in customer service excellence, from among 19 State and private sector banks.
“Customer service is a vital necessity in any industry be it banking or otherwise, something that is expected as a given by customers, and rightly so. The pandemic induced stress in customers made this even more clear, and Seylan Bank took extra care to offer an enhanced level of service to customers who were anxious for uninterrupted banking services, ensuring that they were served above and beyond their expectations at every touch point, both physical and digital. This recognition by customers themselves, amply demonstrates our commitment to customer service, which is part of the DNA of the Bank with a Heart. We are absolutely grateful to our customers for the trust and faith they have placed on us, and for lauding our efforts,” said Seylan Bank Assistant General Manager, Marketing and Sales Gamika De Silva, commenting on the 
recognition.
At the very outset of the pandemic, Seylan Bank anticipated the changing needs of customers and proactively committed itself to serving them. The bank opened doors of its branches whenever allowed by the authorities, in addition to enhancing its digitisation efforts to ensure customers could handle all their banking needs through internet banking and online channels, from the safety of their home. Seylan launched doorstep services with the mobile ATM service for areas in isolation and where customers could not even reach an ATM. 
The youngest customers of the bank, the Seylan Tikiri account holders, were kept in high morale through digital competitions and gift packs; while the bank organised webinars for the SME sector on doing business in the new normal under very different economic circumstances. The bank also provided relief to customers in the form of debt moratoriums on loans and leases, while Seylan cardholders benefited from lower transaction charges and minimum monthly payments and enjoyed extended offers on purchases from Seylan merchant partners.
“Customer retention is the most important element of good customer service. A customer will not remain with a brand that is unsatisfying, especially in an environment where they have a multitude of choices. At Seylan Bank, we ask ourselves how we can become the ‘Primary Bank’ of a customer, and streamline all our customer touchpoints to reflect the value we place in them, by listening to their concerns and attending to their needs. Every single employee of the bank carry this mantra in their work, and such an achievement will not be possible without their commitment. In our 33 of years in serving Sri Lankans, we have always placed the customer at the centre of all our decision making, and this recognition is proof we are doing it right,” De Silva added.
Seylan Bank, the Bank with a Heart, operates with a vision to offer the ultimate banking experience to its valued customers through cutting-edge technology, innovative products, and best-in-class services. The Bank has a growing clientele of SMEs, Retail and Corporate Customers, and has expanded its footprint with 173 branches, 70 Cash Deposit Machines, 66 Cheque Deposit Machines, and an ATM network of 216 units across the country. 
Seylan Bank has been endorsed as a financially stable organisation with performance excellence across the board by Fitch Ratings, with the bank’s national long-term rating revised to ‘A’ (lka). The bank was ranked second among public listed companies for transparency in corporate reporting by Transparency Global and is now part of the S&P Dow Jones SL 20 Index. These achievements are a testament to Seylan Bank’s financial stability and unwavering dedication to ensuring excellence across all aspects.

Downward moment in bond yields continue ahead of T-Bill auction

Equities will remain the preferred asset class in 2021 amidst a low interest rate environment
Corporate earnings and free cashflow to see healthy growth in 2021 fuelled by the sustained tax cuts, low finance costs and better demand conditions


Following a year of volatility, leading stockbroking firm Asia Securities Ltd. notes that the road ahead for Sri Lanka’s capital markets is optimistic, with the ASPI expected to reach 7,400-7,600 in 2021. 
The Sri Lankan stock market marked a V-shaped recovery in 2020, seeing one of its strongest rallies to recover all losses suffered over the course of the coronavirus pandemic. The latest Asia Securities Sri Lanka: 2021 Equity Outlook report titled ‘Zero in on the Recovery’ highlights that the forces behind one of the fastest recoveries include a low interest rate environment, manufacturing-dominance led by protection for local firms, and renewed economic hopes and policy stability with both the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections now behind.

A strong bounce back from historic lows
The report highlights that “Low interest rates locally continue to provide further impetus for the market to rally and local investors will continue to carry the mantle in 2021. Despite the likelihood of rates bottoming out once credit growth picks up, we expect equities to remain the more attractive asset class as rates will be recovering from a historic low.” 

Further upside to ASPI amidst historically low interest rates
In addition to low interest rates, the strong trajectory for Sri Lanka equities is supported by an improvement in earnings (coming from a lower base), and large caps gaining momentum with earnings picking up. The Asia Securities report also forecasts a healthy pickup in corporate earnings in 2021 driven by consumption-related stimuli, and lower finance costs which will help the bottom line. 

Emerging markets ready for primetime in 2021, however, Sri Lanka to see latent fund flows
Asia Securities Research said that the momentum in equities from this point forth will also be dependent on how certain global factors playout. Emerging markets are expected to take off again in 2021, breaking a decade-long trend of asset allocations towards developed markets amidst superior growth, a strengthening USD, and strong yields. Several factors will drive this shift, including: 

Weaker USD in the medium-term
A weakening USD will push investors to rebalance their portfolios and spur capital flows into emerging markets. With lower currency risk, Asia Securities Research sees cheaper emerging market valuations being more appealing and rewarding for investors. 

Emerging markets set for a 2021 takeoff
Faster growth than developed markets – Bloomberg consensus point at emerging markets growing (real GDP) at a faster 5.0% in 2021E, compared to 4.0% for developed markets. (2022E; emerging markets – 5.1%, developed markets – 3.1%). One of the main reasons for a faster emerging markets recovery is better management of the pandemic. With stronger growth prospects and low currency risks, Asia Securities Research notes that emerging markets are in a “sweet spot” in 2021. 
Lower valuations – While emerging markets have underperformed the S&P 500 over the last decade, earnings expectations have been on the rise with hopes of a faster recovery.
Low interest rates – As it is still a struggle to find yield in government bonds amidst low interest rates, a risk-on approach with global recovery will drive funds to faster growing emerging market economies.  
Trade – The election of Joe Biden represents a return to more predictable US politics. An easing of trade tensions between US and China can further aid recovery in the Asian markets.
While a risk-on sentiment with vaccine deployment and global recovery will favour equities in 2021, Asia Securities Research highlighted that regional countries are likely attract foreign fund flows first, with Sri Lanka seeing latent fund flows. Concerns around Sri Lanka’s low credit rating mean that Sri Lankan equities can expect a very gradual improvement in foreign fund flows.

Asia Securities Research recommend rotation towards “COVID recovery” beneficiary stocks
Asia Securities’ key picks for 2021 are weighted towards consumer sector, as well as cyclical stocks that look attractive in a path to recovery. Corporate earnings will see a healthy pickup in 2021 driven by consumption-related stimuli, and lower finance costs which help the bottom line. In addition, free cash flow generation should remain strong, given that corporates will operate in an environment fuelled by tax cuts early in late 2019/early 2020. 
Local manufacturing is also expected to see improved utilisation with higher protection. With an accommodative fiscal policy and consistent tax policies, the effects of the tax cuts (yet to materialise given the timing and impact of COVD-19) are also expected come to fruition in 2021.

Recent Fitch Ratings’ assessments about the current state of loans and lending have caused alarm in the local banking scenario

The global economy is in decline, mummifying all activities and virtually halting growth prospects, due to the COVID-19 pandemic spreading at an alarming speed, signalling signs of the worst economic shock the world has experienced in the form of the deepest recession after several decades. 
Attention of financial circles throughout the world remains heavily focused on the performance of the banking sector and its asset quality associated with the conundrum. Key words interacting correlated to the ongoing discussion are Fitch Ratings, Non-Performing Loans (NPL), impairment, Loan Loss Provisions (LLPs), equity capital and credit risks, etc.
In a background of major financial catastrophes such as the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 followed by other localised more recent happenings including those in Cyprus and Greece, loan portfolios of banks have become serious concerns of those focusing on early recognition of credit losses and transparent disclosures. Regulatory and accounting treatment of bank assets occupy an important position under these.
Recent Fitch Ratings’ assessments about the current state of loans and lending have caused alarm in the local banking scenario. Particularly in association with unprecedented lowering of ratings there is a compelling need for a closer and careful scrutiny of the overall position.
A recent news flash states that combined impaired loan ratio of BOC and PB is at 9.8% by end of September from 10.4% end 2019 while impaired loan ratio at private banks increased 10.1% from 8.8%. Fitch Ratings went on to qualify its reference by further stating that ‘the pressure on asset quality was more evident in the privately-owned banks, and a rise in impaired loan ratios in both State and private banks could become crystallised from the second or third quarter of next year as the moratorium would hide the true nature of the loans under stress at present.”
However, Fitch Ratings is highly sceptical about the true position of this difference in the shift and how the picture would look applied to all banks once the moratorium granted by the CBSL (initially for six months from April last year and further extended by another six months lasting in March 2021), ends. 
One significant factor Fitch Ratings may have overlooked could be the degree of uniformity in the application of the moratorium as allowed by the CBSL in the State and private sectors. With less political pressure, the private sector banks are apparently engaging to regularise borrowings and set aside adequate provisions without dramatically increasing the risk of write-offs as a safety measure against an unpredictable environment in the future. This sounds more sensible and a safe measure helping in the long term to reduce the need to raise equity in the event of a crisis.
Even if the number of NPLs decline, it is more prudent and realistic to apply higher impairment losses to loans in the category of reasonable suspicion of default. There cannot be any controversy about the number of risky loans growing at an increasing rate according to the prevailing conditions.
State banks are blessed with a ready source for capital augmentation as we have seen in the past, the Treasury. So, they do not have to take pains in chasing the borrowers to reduce their obligations and/or bring them into the regular fold by following other possible steps such as rescheduling.
The composition of the loan portfolio (mix-up) is another important factor for the two State banks to keep their combined loan impairment figures low. Approximately about 52% of their total loans are either direct to the State or to the SOEs.
Application of general impairment rules are relaxed extensively and there is a great deal of leeway available to the State banks in respect of advances to the State sector despite their default status. Even the regulatory controls seems to be applied in an offhand manner.
An example of this practice can be elaborated by referring to how the very large defaulted outstanding amounts of SriLankan Airlines is treated by the two leading State banks. In one bank the loan is continued in the current section while the other bank has applied the regulatory criteria and transferred it to NPL category. 
A namesake guarantee provided by the Treasury in the form of a Letter of Comfort issued to authorise the lending is regarded by the former to treat it as a fully secured facility while the latter has applied other obvious criteria such as the balance sheet positions and the net-worth of the entity in assessing its asset quality as sub-standard or doubtful despite the cover available under similar letters of comfort. The NPL in one bank remains low whereas LPL balance and the loan impairment losses in the other shows an increase. This makes an accurate comparing unrealistic and impossible. To that extent the ratings by Fitch become debatable.

Managing Director and CEO Jonathan Alles 

Hatton National Bank was recently recognised as the ‘Best Managed Bank During COVID-19 in Sri Lanka’ by the prestigious Asian Banker Magazine, while the bank’s Managing Director and CEO Jonathan Alles was awarded the Leadership Achievement Award for having delivered the Best CEO response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka. 
“I am indebted to my staff for their sacrifices and tremendous dedication in ensuring the smooth continuity of business at such a critical moment when our customers needed us the most. Our strategy during this time was focused on providing essential support to those who were most severely impacted by the COVID crisis while extending our assistance to all customers to rapidly transition into digital banking channels.
“We are proud to say that these efforts have been very successful. As a nation, we still have a tough road ahead, but we remain optimistic that if we continue to work together, we can overcome any challenge and support a grassroots recovery in key sectors of the national economy,” Alles stated. 
HNB stepped up to provide essential relief to over 85,000 customers, covering approximately 40% of the bank’s lending portfolio through moratoriums and has thus far approved working capital financing of approximately Rs. 24 billion under the Central Bank relief schemes. 
The bank also set up a Rs. 5 billion fund to support the SME customers who were not eligible under the CBSL schemes. This scheme was launched utilising the bank’s own funds. 
Recently HNB launched a Rs. 20 million fund to provide assistance by way of a grant to 200 microfinance customers. The grant will enable customers who have been affected by the ongoing COVID pandemic to revive their businesses. 
HNB’s strategic focus on being future-ready and early adoption of digitalisation enabled the bank to support the customers within the social distancing guidelines. The customers were offered the convenience of carrying out their routine transactions, such as balance enquiry, bill payments, fund transfers, opening fixed deposits, etc., from any location through the e-banking platform, which is currently being revamped. The support required continued to be provided through the 24/7 Contact Centre. 
Additionally, the bank’s digital payment options including MOMO – mobile POS, SOLO – QR-based payment app and the internet payment gateway proved to be timely as it provided the businesses with the ability to accept cashless payments. 
Launching the Appigo platform amidst the lockdown, the bank enabled the merchants to create a comprehensive and fully functional online store from scratch in a very short period of time. In order to facilitate transactions with vendors who were unable to accept card or online payments, HNB launched the doorstep mobile ATM service during the lockdown. 
Despite the challenges brought on by COVID, the bank also pursued critical technology enhancement projects under the bank’s transformation roadmap. Accordingly, the bank’s Finacle core banking solution was upgraded to the most up-to-date version available in Sri Lanka.
Ensuring the health and safety of all the stakeholders remains a key priority of the bank. As such, the bank continues to fully adhere to the measures outlined by the health authorities. 
Notably, in 2019, Asian Banker recognised HNB as the ‘Best Managed Bank in the Country’ for its performance from 2016-2018 and the MD/CEO was bestowed with the Leadership Achievement Award. HNB was also declared the Best Retail Bank in Sri Lanka at the prestigious Asian Banker Excellence in Retail Financial Services Awards 2020, marking the 11th occasion that the bank had emerged as winners. The award was presented to HNB in recognition of the bank’s sustainable growth and continuous improvements in processes, products and services amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment.

""I am very pleased to announce the launch of this vital source of funding through our Sustainability Foundation in support of microfinance entrepreneurs. 2020 has been extraordinarily challenging for all and this initiative comes at a most opportune and appropriate moment when businesses across the island are seeking the capital necessary to restart work. Our expectation is that our customers will make good use of this grant, for working capital, recapitalising their business and get back on their feet. As we have worked with the microfinance sector for more than three decades and SME sector since our origins, we have come to understand that we need to scale up our support by providing them with the necessary financial assistance and literacy to uplift them from the grassroots to become a SME,” HNB Managing Director and CEO and HNB Sustainability Foundation Chairman Jonathan Alles said.

Over the recent past, the bank was ranked among the World Top 1,000 Banks list compiled by the prestigious UK-based Banker Magazine. 
Other prestigious accolades won by the bank include the Best Retail Bank in Sri Lanka award for 2020 by the Asian Banker Magazine and a total of seven awards at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards 2019 organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.

Revamp to improve governance, transparency and rebalance investment portfolio
Intends to facilitate more prudent investment decisions
Wants to seek alternative investment avenues given low interest environment
Operational efficiency and optimal service to stakeholders also targeted

The Central Bank plans to revise the Investment Guidelines governing the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) to improve transparency and rebalance the investment portfolio to generate higher income for members. 
Releasing Road Map ,2021 Central Bank Governor Prof. W.D. Lakshman said that the changes would also be aimed at enhancing operational efficiency.   
“Going forward, we expect to revise the Investment Guidelines to be in line with the latest market developments. The intention is to facilitate a more prudent investment decision making process, while strengthening the existing internal control environment,” he said this week. 
“We expect to rebalance the investment portfolio to generate a high risk adjusted rate of return compared to market rates, while seeking alternative investment avenues to diversify the investment portfolio given the current low interest rate environment.”
Further, to enhance the operational efficiency and provide an optimal service to the stakeholders, the Central Bank plans to implement a business process reengineering in 2021, with the assistance of competent consultants, thereby implementing a member-centric integrated IT solution, and investment and accounting modules.
The Central Bank continues to manage the largest superannuation fund in Sri Lanka, the EPF, with a view to facilitating a diversified medium to long-term investment strategy. The intent has always been to provide the maximum possible return to members, while adhering to stringent investment guidelines, the report added. 
“We have engaged in primary and secondary market investments in Government securities and equity transactions while also investing in corporate debentures.”
The EPF is the largest pension fund in Sri Lanka and is responsible for providing retirement funds to millions of workers. In Budget 2021 the Government proposed changing the retirement age from 55 years to 60 but this has been challenged by unions that insist workers should retain access to their EPF funds under current provisions.

"Thursday, 7 January 2021 00:00",DailyFT,"
TORONTO (Reuters): Some global hedge fund investors are going into 2021 optimistic about a speedy snap-back from the economic challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic.
Hedge funds, which use leverage and employ more aggressive, often riskier strategies than other investors, believe many previously undesirable sectors, ranging from energy to retail, will rebound in 2021.
Accounting for roughly $3 trillion in assets, hedge funds showed resilience in 2020, with many outperforming the market, according to investors.
“We think 2021 is going to be a really positive year for the markets,” said Jason Donville, president and CEO at Toronto-based hedge fund Donville Kent Asset Management. He forecasts an explosion of pent-up demand for travel and leisure producing a period of “super growth.”
“I think it will take a little while for the vaccines to roll out and then somewhere around March, April, May, you’re going to get a confluence of the vaccines getting to a certain critical mass... and infection rates dropping.”
For 2020 as a whole, the S&P 500 unofficially rose 16.26%, a stunning rally from a bear market that kicked off when the pandemic spread rapidly earlier in the year.
“What I would say about 2021 is it looks like it’s going to be a year of recovery,” said Robert Sears, chief investment officer at UK-based Capital Generation Partners, which invests in hedge funds globally. “That’s the consensus view.”
The gainers in 2020 included the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector, up more than 42% as the sector benefited from the abrupt acceleration of online trends. On the other hand, the S&P 500 Hotels Restaurants and Leisure eeked out a gain of 1.4%.In the past quarter, however, leisure stocks have rebounded as vaccine rollouts have accelerated hopes of recovery.
“I think macro conditions are going to continue to be quite volatile, so macro should have a good year,” said Sears, referring to funds that invest according to macroeconomic trends.
He added that funds that specialize in currencies and commodities should do well.
Jack McIntyre, a portfolio manager at $62 billion U.S. firm Brandywine Global, which runs a macro hedge fund strategy, said there will be “less uncertainty and more certainty” in the new year.
Financials are a sector that has been challenged by coronavirus and could be supported by a recovery, said Philippe Ferreira at Paris-based fund of hedge fund Lyxor Asset Management, adding that the sector typically performs better in the initial stage of a recovery.
“Managers are easing the short bias toward financials because we are entering a recovery,” said Ferreira, whose firm invests in hedge funds globally.
The S&P Financial Index fell around 4.3% in 2020 despite rebounding in the fourth quarter.
“On the macro side, managers say that with rates so low, they are diversifying fixed income with inflation and especially on the U.S. side and gold,” said Ferreira.
North American energy is another beaten-down sector popular with hedge funds, market participants said. The Canadian Energy Sector Index lost 37.8% over the entirety of 2020 while a comparable index for the U.S. fell 37.3%. “Anything in energy... all of that is a COVID recovery play to the extent the demand for fuel goes up, people start going back to the office more,” said one Canadian hedge fund manager.
“We’re adding the names like AltaGas, Pembina and Canadian Natural Resources and we’ve been a buyer since post-the U.S. election.”
AltaGas stock plummeted 60% in March and is down 5.1% for the year through Dec. 31. Shares in Pembina and Canadian Natural Gas fell 61.3% and 27.3%, respectively, over 2020.
“I would say that energy consumption is going to make a very healthy recovery and probably continue on an above-historical year-on-year level,” said Jay Tatum, portfolio manager at New York-based metals-focused Valent Asset Management. He added that oil was only one source of energy that would see growth.

LOLC General Insurance, a fully-owned subsidiary of the LOLC Group, recently became Sri Lanka’s first general insurance company to achieve Rs. 6 billion Gross Written Premium (GWP) in less than 10 years. The company reached the Rs. 6 billion mark in December 2020, becoming the fastest general insurance company to achieve this milestone in the industry. LOLC General Insurance CEO Kithsiri Gunawardena talks of the many key attributes that helped reach this achievement:






LOLC General Insurance CEO Kithsiri Gunawardena
 




Q: What were the main factors that helped LOLC General Insurance reach the Rs. 6 billion GWP mark in less than 10 years?
 LOLC General Insurance is a young company compared to the rest in the industry. During the last few years we continuously streamlined the processes and achieved greater coordination between different units of the company. The entire staff was motivated to work as one team and embark on a customer centric approach.  
A scheme was introduced whereby a pre-designated percentage of the company profits are shared with our staff thereby elevating them to become true stakeholders of our business. We also critically analysed our expenses and introduced mechanisms to achieve greater efficiency and productivity. 
The combination of these measures and our aggressive sales model supported by the commitment of our team resulted in the company being able to secure a substantial volume of new business outside of the group reflecting that we are well aligned to the needs of the market.
With a service first mind-set and the strong backing of the LOLC Group, LOLC General Insurance became the fastest growing Insurer in the industry with the highest growth in Motor as well as Non-Motor portfolios. This achievement was also made possible by the trust and confidence placed in us by our customers throughout the country as well as the indispensable contribution made by our staff. 
The aggressive approach in sales, flexibility in policy options and a customer centric product portfolio has enabled this growth over the years. The company hopes to maintain the same focus, approach and excellence in the years ahead to sustain this growth momentum. 

Q: How did the company manage to progress despite the pandemic in 2020? 
 Year 2020 was probably the most challenging year for most businesses in the country and the insurance industry recorded a negative growth. Interestingly, LOLC General Insurance managed to record its best performance during this year. Although external operating conditions remained challenging, the General Insurance business performed steadily. 
Most disruptions create opportunities and we capitalised on becoming even more aggressive when most others opted to be cautious. By December 2020, we were able to reach the Rs. 6 b mark mainly because of the commitment of our team who were always geared and motivated to offer uninterrupted services to the customers even during the pandemic. 

Q: What makes LOLC General Insurance different from the rest in the industry? 
 The aggressive business model, highly motivated and loyal staff, passionate leadership, unstinted reputation within the market on service quality and last but not least the strong backing of the LOLC Group is what makes us stand apart. 

Q: How do you view the opportunity and potential in the local market for General Insurance?  
The opportunities are immense in the market. With a saturated motor market and the challenge of limited new registrations for the foreseeable future, the price and service will be key in this sphere. The Non-Motor market is noticeably underpenetrated and this gives LOLC General Insurance opportunities to grow with our unique products and services to customers.  

Q: What are your future expansion plans? 
Year 2021 will see innovations in terms of customer engagement with respect to digital transformation as well as unique product ranges and service standards being introduced. By locating branches strategically, the company is enhancing customer convenience. 
Our focus on accomplishing full automation remains strong with the entire process automated end-to-end, from meeting the customer to the point of delivery while policy servicing is achieved via technology platforms. The country-wide reach will be enhanced with the formation of new regions/branches and close to 70 dedicated service points being established.

Q: Any plans to venture into international markets? 
 With LOLC expanding into many markets in Asia and Africa, we too hope to expand the insurance services and products to several selected and potential international markets in the near future. LOLC Group has a very strong and highly respected brand presence in all the markets we operate. In some of these markets, the Insurance industry is in the early stages of development. Thus, the regulators are keen on the introduction of micro insurance products to support small and medium scale businesses for 
systemic stability.

LONDON (Reuters); Digital currency bitcoin has emerged as a rival to gold and could trade as high as $146,000 if it becomes established as a safe-haven asset, investment bank JPMorgan (JPM) said on Tuesday.
Interest in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency has soared this year, with investors viewing bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to the depreciating dollar. The rush led to bitcoin prices more than tripling in the past six months to a record peak of $34,800 on 2 January.
“Bitcoin’s competition with gold has already started in our mind,” the Wall Street bank’s strategists said in a note, citing recent $7 billion outflows from gold and more than $3 billion of inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.
That could mark a new dawn for the volatile digital currency after years as a play for speculators and retail punters.
“Considering how big the financial investment into gold is, a crowding out of gold as an ‘alternative’ currency implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term,” JPM said. Bitcoin is likely to outshine gold as millennials become a more important component of the investment market over time and given their preference for “digital gold” over traditional bullion, JPM added.
With a market capitalisation of $575 billion, the bitcoin price would need a nearly fivefold jump to $146,000 to match the value of private gold wealth held in gold bars, coins or exchange-traded funds, the bank’s note added.
JPM strategists said the upside is conditional on the volatility of bitcoin converging with that of gold in the longer term.
Though JPM sees the possibility of “current speculative mania” propelling bitcoin to between $50,000 and $100,000, it warned that such levels would prove unsustainable until its volatility levels out.
“We note that the spectacular bitcoin rally of the past few weeks has moved bitcoin into more challenging territory, not only in terms of its positioning backdrop, but also in terms of its valuation,” the bank said.

Fiscal and monetary authorities in Sri Lanka have undertaken unprecedented steps to revamp the fragile economy during the pandemic situation through massive fiscal stimulus and easing monetary regulations to uplift the nation. Reaping the benefits is in the hands of all economic sectors and individuals of a positive approach to recuperate the economy of the country

 
 
The movement of interest rates spread led by the pandemic in world economy
When compared to other countries it has been observed that the interest rates spread for Sri Lankan commercial banks are much higher reflecting high intermediation cost incurred by local commercial banks. The banking sector has been developing gradually over the years in terms of number of banks, number of branches, assets and in terms of the usage of technology in customer service. 
However, banks so far have been unable to reduce considerably their intermediation costs, and hence the problem of high interest rates spread exists. Gaining a clear understanding about the factors that influence the interest rates spread would help effective policymaking.
Global economy landscape has reshaped with an everlasting impact with the surge of COVID-19 pandemic. It is anticipated that most of the developed and emerging economies will plunge in to a recession in 2020 and beyond, contracting major portion of GDP ever since 1870s. 
The reduction of interest rates, stimulus packages backed by respective governments together with unconventional monetary policy measures have been included to the day today vocabulary. It has been envisaged a 5.2% contraction in global GDP in 2020, the deep recession ignited in global economy with the pandemic across the world.
In response to the pandemic-induced global recession, monetary authorities across the world have commenced to introduce lower interest rates – with Eurozone, Switzerland, and Japan already in the negative interest rates zone and the US Federal Reserve seemingly heading in the same direction. Global stock markets tanked in March 2020. 
For a time even US Treasury bonds, the world’s safest asset, fell in price amid a scramble for cash and turned into dysfunctional money markets. The Federal Reserve in USA cut interest rates and unleashed a torrent of liquidity to keep dollar markets functioning, preventing a credit crunch, mass bankruptcies and lay-offs. 
Other central banks followed suit. From the beginning of year 2020, Central Banks in the US, UK, Japan and the European Banking sector have created new money worth of $ 3.8 trillion, much of which have kept yields on long-term Government debt close to zero.

Navigation of interest rates in Sri Lankan context amid COVID-19
Considering the necessity to further support the economy to endure the adverse economic impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, given subdued inflationary pressures, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided in addition to the other measures taken to ease monetary conditions in the market, to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 50 basis points to 5.50% and 6.50%, respectively, effective from 6 May.
Additionally with the objective of revamping the affected businesses by the COVID-19 pandemic, the CBSL, in consultation with the Government of Sri Lanka, implemented Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Loan Scheme Facility in three phases to provide working capital loans at a lower interest rate of 4% per annum, with a repayment period of 24 months, including a grace period of six months and subsequently granted extension period of repayment considering the turbulent situation and constraints of repayment arisen with the second wave of the pandemic. 
Further backing lower interest rates as the best growth formula, the CBSL last week decided banks would change 7% p.a. on mortgage backed housing loans and would introduce lending targets to selected sectors to counter the second COVID-19 wave. The Monetary Board at its last monetary policy announcement for this year kept policy rules unchanged and decided to introduce two new measures to complement the concessional loan scheme proposed by the Budget 20/21.
Yet fulfilling its national duty as the regulator of the economy, the CBSL has decided to reduce the Statutory Reserve Ratio(SRR) applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of licensed commercial banks (LCBs) by 200 basis points to 2.00%, with effect from the reserve maintenance period that commenced on 16 June. 
This reduction in the SRR injected around Rs. 115 billion of additional liquidity to the domestic money s market, enabling the financial system to expedite credit flows to the economy, while reducing the cost of funds of LCBs. 
The financial sector is expected to pass the benefit of the high level of liquidity and the reduced cost of funds to the economy without delay, by increasing lending to businesses and households at low cost. The Monetary Board will continue to monitor economic and financial market developments and will take further policy and regulatory measures to support a sustained revival of economic activity in the period ahead.
Monetary policy and control its money supply, often mandated with maintaining low inflation and steady GDP growth. On a macro basis influence interest rates and participate in open market operations to control the cost of borrowing and lending throughout an economy.  Thus the regulators extended their duty to the interest of the nation in relaxing monetary policy guidelines with the objective of infusing additional liquidity to the economy during this strenuous situation. 
However, instead of investing the funds which obtained at an incentive low rate, the manipulation and diversion of additional funds could be witnessed and thus a liquidity trap has awaken which hinders the normal function of spurring the economy to growth. 
At this juncture the role of the regulator is vital to influence interest rates in the economy, affecting the behaviour of borrowers and lenders, economic activity and ultimately the rate of inflation.
However the issue is not entirely above level of market liquidity. It is more about structural deficiencies within the banking sector such as high tendency for transferring facilities to Non Performing (NPL) category since most of the businesses and individuals tend to exploit the incentive of low interest rate by acquiring more consumption rather than investing funds to the affected businesses. 
Therefore, it is indispensable to identify the needy sectors and follow the end use of funds through a comprehensive monitoring mechanism. Also it is prudent to manage moderate rate for consumption as such misappropriation of funds is expected to be minimised.
The reduction in interest rates will improve the repayment capacity of borrowers, strengthen licensed banks and address the challenges of rising NPLs. Also the banks could establish Business Revival Units in order to reduce NPLs by granting additional loans on lower rates for the purpose of recovering hardcore facilities.
In today’s global economic environment, it seems like conventional measures of monetary stimulus are not only sufficient to lead to greater economic growth; they are actually counterproductive and damage the economy by causing market concentration and unproductive investment, and increasing trade deficits and debt. 
Central Banks have already realised their importance in contemporary conditions and time to time in supervision, the Central Banks assess the risks that financial institutions pose to financial system stability and, where necessary, take actions to reduce them.
Despite the fact that the interest rate cuts should support economic growth, they alone may not be substantial enough to offset the impact of sluggish growth of economy. The cost of financing may not be the main factor deterring businesses from investing. Therefore this should be a wake-up call for countries to take efforts towards diversifying their economic base to avoid daunting vulnerabilities of low interest rates and get benefited as expected by the policy makers. 

Expectation vs. Reality
The conservative insight is that low interest rate is positive for economic growth because it paves the way for governments, businesses, and consumers to borrow hence spurring investment and ultimately increasing employment and GDP growth. However, it is ambiguous that current lowering of interest rates would boost investment and which in turn assist to revive the economy. 
In spite of everything, the current issues in the world economy are the repercussions led by the pandemic, both on demand and supply, as it disrupted global supply chains, restricted people movement and closure of borders. 
In this backdrop, it is unlikely that rate cuts will generate productive investments at a time when business entities prefer to save rather than to invest not due to high costs of borrowing and “high” interest rates but because of the uncertainty associated with the pandemic. 
Also, particularly when the lower rates introduced for consumption loans such as housing, purchasing capital items, education etc, it is doubtful that funds would be utilised for the same purpose. Therefore, diverting funds will be a common lapse made by the borrowers with the financial constraints followed by the pandemic.
According to the latest researches, it has been stated that low interest rates, instead of higher contribution towards the economic growth, have contractionary consequences due to increased market concentration and subsequent formation of monopolies.
As the authors of the researches claim, “lowering interest rates have an expansionary effect on the economy through stronger productivity growth”. However, although lower interest rates encourage all firms in a sector to invest further, the incentive has been grasped by market leaders than followers. 
As a result, industries become more monopolistic over time as long-term rates fall. The various studies concluded that low interest rates would lead to monopolisation of the economy, slowing growth in productivity, and rising inequality rather than stimulating the development of the economy.
However, it has been witnessed in today’s context particularly in economies in South Asian Region which have low or moderate per capita income that traditional monetary measures is no longer assist in reviving the economy. They contribute in rising inequality for lower interest rates benefit mostly the wealthy, who possess large financial holdings, and hurt middle-class families and retirees who depend on their investments and savings for a living.
Low interest rates, by spurring the growth in consumption, reduce national savings. In turn, in the long run the reductions in national savings directly root to the current account imbalances, in particular, trade deficits and subsequent fiscal deficits.
At the instance of paying incentives of low interest rates to the economy, the banks and other financial institutions may overinvest in long-term assets, such as Treasury securities. If interest rates rise unexpectedly, the value of those assets will fall exposing banks to substantial losses.
However, it is affirmed that in this circumstance, lower interest rates would be a favourable factor in improving bank balance sheets and banks’ capacity to lend. During the financial crisis, many banks, particularly some of the largest banks, were found to be undercapitalised, which limited their ability to make loans during the initial stages of the recovery. Therefore, in terms of augmenting the bank balance sheet at the turbulent economy, this would be a blessing in disguise.
Fiscal and monetary authorities in Sri Lanka have undertaken unprecedented steps to revamp the fragile economy during the pandemic situation through massive fiscal stimulus and easing monetary regulations to uplift the nation. Reaping the benefits is in the hands of all economic sectors and individuals in positive approach to recuperate the economy of the country.

Feted for 8th consecutive year








Ceylinco Insurance Executive Chairman/Chief Executive Officer Ajith Gunawardena


 





Ceylinco Insurance Deputy Chairman R. Renganathan




Once again, for the eighth consecutive year, Ceylinco Insurance PLC, the holding company of insurance giants – Ceylinco General Insurance and Ceylinco Life Insurance – was ranked 6th in the
Roll of Honour amongst the ‘Business Today Top 30’ companies in Sri Lanka. As announced in its edition for 2019/20, Ceylinco Insurance retained its 6th position for the second year as an outstanding player in the corporate sector. 
Commenting on the achievement, Ceylinco Insurance PLC Executive Chairman/Chief Executive Officer Ajith Gunawardena said, “Financial Year 2020 was one of the most challenging for the corporate sector – not merely in Sri Lanka but the world over. Organisations who face these challenges fearlessly with re-aligned strategies will perform well. The corporate sector in Sri Lanka has weathered many storms and shown great resilience. We are humbled by the fact that once again we are ranked at No. 6 amongst the distinguished top 30 companies in Sri Lanka. 
“Ceylinco Insurance PLC has demonstrated great resilience, surmounting every challenge with sustainable strategies. I would like to express my gratitude to our loyal customers for placing their trust and belief in us through the most difficult times. It is their loyalty and confidence that motivates us to reach higher, as we make every effort to serve them beyond their expectations. I wish to dedicate this recognition to our valued customers, our staff and my fellow directors for enabling us to reach another milestone in our vibrant journey.” 
Ceylinco Insurance PLC Deputy Chairman and Ceylinco Life Chairman R. Renganathan said: “A company’s true mettle is tested in times of adversity. Ceylinco Life’s performance in 2020 is an excellent demonstration of this. Our ability to adapt to the demands of the ‘new normal’ to not only fulfil our obligations to our customers and stakeholders, but to grow the business in a period of uncertainty and disruption more than justifies our presence among the top 10 of Sri Lanka’s leading corporate entities. Notably, Ceylinco Life also fulfilled all its community-related commitments in 2020, while continuing with its program of policyholder rewards, despite the challenges of the year.”
As the clear market dominator in the Insurance sector, both, Ceylinco General Insurance and Ceylinco Life Insurance remained far ahead of competition in 2019 as well as in 2020. Ceylinco General and Ceylinco Life also enjoyed the privilege of being voted the ‘People’s Insurance Company’ for the 14th consecutive year. This award reiterates the high regard with which both companies are viewed by the general public and for its continuous contribution towards enhancing the socio-economic development of Sri Lanka. Also, in an exclusive survey carried out amongst the service providers over a period of 12 weeks by LMD magazine, Ceylinco General Insurance had the honour of being the most popular insurer in Service Excellence.

Cash and cheques can now be deposited paper-free into current or savings accounts at Commercial Bank of Ceylon, following the launch of an innovative new app that generates ‘e-slips.’
This is the first app to be launched in Sri Lanka for cheque deposits, and significantly enhances customer convenience in the new normal environment, the Bank said.
The Commercial Bank e-Slip app enables customers to create electronic deposits on their smart phones in respect of cash and cheque deposits.
This app can be downloaded free of charge from the App Store or Google Play Store. The app is operable in English, Sinhala and Tamil and is compatible with both Android and iOS powered smartphones and devices. The Bank said anyone with the app can now support its green initiative by eliminating the paper and envelopes used in the standard deposit process.
Catering to a clientele that is environment-conscious, the app also helps save time, as customers can digitally fill their e-slips on the app for cash deposits or capture an image of the cheque after crossing the reverse with the words ‘Com e-Cheque’ for cheque deposits before arriving at the Bank. Depositors can also conveniently maintain a record of all their deposits in one place on the app, without the hassle of filing the receipts of their bank slips.
After downloading the ‘ComBank e-Slips’ app users simply self-register themselves, activate their app after receiving a one-time-password (OTP), and begin their slip-less deposits. Whenever an e-slip is created the app generates a QR code which can be shown at the bank counter when the cash is handed over. After making a cheque deposit via the e-Cheque app, the customer or his agent is required to deposit the original cheque in a designated ‘Drop Box’ at the nearest branch within three days. The customer’s app will be updated with the status of the cheque when the bank submits it for clearing.
The e-Slips app provides users the facility of verifying the account numbers of recipients before making deposits, and categorising each deposit according to purpose for convenient tracking and retrieval. Each completed transaction is acknowledged with an e-receipt.
Customers can only deposit one cheque per transaction via the e-Cheque app at a time, although any number of transactions can be submitted in a day, the Bank said. Cheques up to the value of Rs. 2 million can be deposited through the app. Customers are also required to state the purpose of the transaction in the app when depositing cheques with a value of over Rs. 200,000 to a Savings Account or above Rs. 500,000 to a Current Account.
When cheques are deposited via the app for utility bill payments, for Commercial Bank Credit Card payments or to accounts with special narrations, it is mandatory to state such details on the reverse of the cheque prior to scanning it. The depositor is also required to type in the narration in the space provided in the app for it to be processed. 
The e-receipt generated after a successful transaction will include a QR code and a reference number, and will be saved in the app with the image of the relevant cheque for a period of three months.
In 2019, Commercial Bank was presented the ‘Excellent Green Commitment Award’ for  the Banking Sector by the Green Building Council of Sri Lanka (GBCSL), the country’s leading authority on implementing green concepts and green building practices, in acknowledgement of the Bank’s progress in eco-friendly operations.
The Bank also broke new ground in 2016 when it became the first bank in Sri Lanka to offer customers an e-Passbook that provides access to details of savings, current, personal and business foreign currency accounts and Credit Card transactions on Android and iOS powered mobile devices.

LONDON (Reuters): Dump the dollar! Buy emerging markets! Stay sustainable! These are among the consensus trades investment banks and asset managers reckon will dominate financial markets in 2021.
Vaccines will – hopefully – make 2021 the year of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has upended some sectors and reinforced the dominance of others.
Here are five trades the world’s biggest investment houses seem to agree on:
 
1. The mighty (dollar) falling
COVID-19 ended a decade of dollar strength, and expectations are for 2021 to bring more greenback pitfalls.
BofA’s December investor survey showed ‘shorting’ the dollar was the second most crowded trade. Another gauge – US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data – shows $ 30 billion in net dollar shorts, swinging from last December’s $ 17 billion net long.
The reasoning, says Peter Fitzgerald, chief investment officer for multi-asset and macro at Aviva Investors, is that no central bank can ‘out-dove the Fed’.
In other words, when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates near 0%, it kicked away the dollar’s yield advantage over peers. And it still has room to ease policy.
President Donald Trump’s imminent exit should also reduce trade and political tensions, which were dollar-supportive.
How much and for how long will the dollar fall? Analysts polled by Reuters predict weakness to endure until mid-2021, capped by COVID-19 uncertainty.
But asset manager PIMCO notes dollar declines are fastest after deep recessions, with five instances of 8%-10% annual depreciations recorded between 2003 and 2018.
Vaccines and rebounding economies will ‘hasten the dollar’s fall from grace’, PIMCO predicted.

2. Re-emerging markets
With developing economies seen benefiting from recovering global trade, tourism and commodities, a weaker dollar and a more predictable White House, Morgan Stanley’s message is: ‘Gotta Buy EM All!’
It’s recommending currencies from China, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa and Russia, alongside bonds from Ukraine and Mexican oil firm Pemex. Rival banks Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are also backing EM for 2021, with the BofA survey showing the sector the main favourite, or ‘overweight’.
Debt in emerging market currencies will net investors 6.2% next year, more than the S&P500, BofA expects.
The sentiment swing towards a sector that’s languished for a decade is driven of course by hopes of a China-led growth recovery but also the lure of higher emerging market interest rates, given 0% or negative yields across richer countries.
EM currencies also have 25% of undervaluation to recoup, asset manager Pictet estimates.
Institute of International Finance (IIF) data shows investors shovelling money into EM assets at the fastest rate in nearly a decade.
But some remain wary. Higher Treasury yields could spark a 2013-style ‘taper tantrum’, Citi suggested. Investment-grade credit ratings are at risk in some countries such as Romania or Mexico, while more debt defaults are likely in weaker nations.

3. (Central) banking on it
Underpinning most bets is the view that the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, Bank of England and People’s Bank of China will keep the cheap money flowing.
Central banks worldwide spent $ 1.3 billion an hour since March on asset purchases, BofA calculates. There were also 190 rate cuts in 2020 year – roughly four every five trading days.
But with global GDP seen expanding 5.4% next year – the most since 1973 – it might be hard to justify pushing the pedal further to the metal, especially if inflation creeps higher.
And not much policy room is left anyway. JPMorgan estimates that over 80% of sovereign bonds from richer nations pay negative yields after factoring in inflation. Many investors including BlackRock are now underweight the sector.
Still, the Big Five’s asset purchases should total $ 3 trillion, Pictet strategist Steve Donze predicts, down from this year’s $ 8 trillion but enough to keep bond yields extremely low.
A note of caution from JPMorgan – consensus forecasts in the past 10-15 years have correctly called the direction of Treasury yields only 40% of the time.

4. ESG – Here for good
The assets of investment funds adhering to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles doubled this past year to over $ 1.3 trillion, and the IIF predicts the pace will accelerate in 2021, especially if US President-elect Joe Biden pursues a greener agenda
Concerns about pollution, climate change and labour rights are the main drivers. But the IIF also points out 80% of ‘sustainable’ equity indices outperformed non-ESG peers during the pandemic-linked selloff, while renewable energy has been the runaway outperformer since then.
BlackRock describes ESG as ‘the tectonic shift transforming investing’, forecasting ‘persistent flows into sustainable assets in the long transition to a less carbon-intensive world.’
Two-thirds of ESG fund assets are in equities, but sustainable debt has grown 20% in 2020 to more than $ 620 billion. Governments are stepping up green debt issuance while central banks are eyeing more sustainable bond-buying and reserve strategies

5. Biden time on tech
Many of the above investment strategies are premised on a very different approach to trade and geopolitics under Biden.
He has vowed the United States will be ‘ready to lead’ again on the global stage, but BofA cautions that China, North Korea or Iran may look to test him early on with ‘provocative actions’.
In some areas – big data, 5G, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, robotics, and cybersecurity – Biden’s policies might be just as combative as Trump’s. That may speed up the move towards what’s dubbed ‘splinternet’, with dual or multiple tech systems.
Tech and e-commerce companies account for almost a quarter of US corporate profits, while tech comprises 40% of MSCI’s emerging equity index. So watch this space.

US five dollar note is seen in this illustration - Reuters

SINGAPORE (Reuters): The dollar started the new year by slipping broadly on Monday as investors sold it for just about everything else in the Asia session, wagering the world’s pandemic recovery will drive other currencies higher.
The euro, which had dipped on New Year’s Eve profit-taking, rose 0.3% to $1.2252. Sterling firmed to $1.3698, levels last seen in early 2018, and the Chinese yuan leapt 0.9% to a 30-month high of 6.4647 per dollar.
The safe-haven yen rose 0.3% to 102.94 per dollar, and looked to test resistance at 102.55, after Japan’s Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, said his government is mulling a state of emergency in Tokyo as infections rise.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars each gained about 0.3% to hold just below multi-year peaks. 
“I think he market is still in this look-through mood,” said Bank of Singapore currency analyst Moh Siong Sim.
“People are looking through pockets of bad news, and the virus resurgence, because of a few things that are supportive,” he said, chiefly referring to the vaccine rollout but also mentioning U.S. stimulus and the Brexit trade deal.
Low U.S. interest rates, massive U.S. budget and trade deficits and a belief that rebounding world trade will drive non-dollar currencies higher have set the dollar on a downward course that has gathered pace as more investors piled in.
The dollar index posted its first annual loss since 2017 last year and has fallen roughly 13% from a three-year peak hit at the height of the pandemic panic in March.
It was last 0.08% weaker at 89.688 and not far above a more than 2-1/2 year low of 89.515 made last week.
Hangover
The softening dollar boosted commodity prices and pushed bitcoin as well as several Asian currencies to milestone highs. The Singapore dollar hit its highest since April 2018 on Monday after data the city-state’s growth shrinking by less than expected last year.
The rising yuan pulled the Malaysian ringgit and South Korean won to multi-year highs as well, while the Indonesian rupiah leapt more than 1% and cryptocurrencies found new peaks.
Bitcoin on Monday was a little off Sunday’s all-time top of $34,800 at $33,491. An enormous rally has carried it up 800% since March as institutional investors seem to have turned buyers. Gold was up 1% at a two-month high of $1,922.
Ahead on the radar, investors are focused on a runoff election in the U.S. state of Georgia on Tuesday which will determine control of the Senate.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting due on Wednesday should offer more detail on discussions about making their forward policy guidance more explicit and the chance of a further increase in asset buying this year.
The data calendar includes a raft of manufacturing surveys across the globe, which will show how industry is coping with the spread of the coronavirus, and the closely watched ISM surveys of U.S. factories and services.
Chinese factory activity continued to accelerate in December, though the PMI missed forecasts at 53.0.
“The global economy is closer to a more sustainable growth recovery amid unprecedented fiscal and monetary support,” Maybank currency analysts said in a note.
In this climate, they wrote, cyclical currencies such as the Aussie, kiwi and those of Asian exporters can benefit - with low global rates increasing the appeal of higher-yielders such as the rupiah, ringgit, rupee and yuan.
“On net...the dollar can see its weakness stay further entrenched.”

A simple “Hi” is all it now takes to access services at the Commercial Bank of Ceylon.
Demonstrating its innovative use of new-age communications, the country’s largest private bank has pioneered a ground-breaking product on the world’s most widely-used messaging platform WhatsApp to become the first Sri Lankan bank to offer banking services on the platform. 
Possibly the easiest and fastest form of contactless banking yet for smartphone users, Commercial Bank’s WhatsApp banking offers services to both accountholders and non-customers, and importantly, can facilitate opening of accounts for those seeking to become customers, the bank said.
Customers of Commercial Bank of Ceylon can use this facility simply by typing ‘Hi’ on WhatsApp and sending the greeting to the designated number, 0713 353 353. A set of simple instructions such as entering numerical commands to receive the information they are looking for will follow, and the required information will be shared with the customer after he or she enters a unique One-Time-Password (OTP) sent by the Bank via SMS. 
A simple onetime registration process would be in place to verify the customer’s identity prior to sharing any sensitive data, ensuring sensitive data is secured and protected. Account holders can access several services including finding out their account balance, viewing account history, or requesting a cheque book, while both customers and non-customers can ask for fixed deposit rates and foreign exchange rates, self-register with the ComBank Digital app or open a new account through the Flash Digital Bank Account via WhatsApp Banking. 
“More than two billion people worldwide now use WhatsApp for their messaging needs, and in Sri Lanka it is estimated that more than 6.5 million people use social media,” Commercial Bank’s Managing Director S. Renganathan said. 
“The most popular messaging platforms are therefore the most logical path to enhancing access to services, especially at a time when social distancing has become the norm. WhatsApp Banking does not require the user to be particularly tech-savvy as the app is widely used and familiar to millions of people.”
The launch of this service eliminates the need for customers to visit a branch for basic banking services. WhatsApp Banking will function as an interim digital offering through which the bank can reach busy customers inclined towards digitising their banking experience, the bank said.
Earlier this year, ComBank announced the integration of all its Online and Mobile Banking channels on a single omni-channel platform with the launch of ‘ComBank Digital’ powered by Fiserv, the US-based global provider of financial services technology. The bank also recently upgraded its ePassbook app with new features including self-registration, real time transaction notifications, and biometric login which led to 100,000 downloads in just four months.

WEBXPAY, the secure and reliable internet payment gateway provider completes five successful years of operations this month. An idea nurtured for months reached fruition when the founders established WEBXPAY in December 2015. With the motto of ‘We don’t dream about success, we work for it’, within five short years, the fin-tech has grown from strength to strength, garnering 2,000 merchants and processing over Rs. 3 billion in transactions by year-end. 
Incorporated in 2015, WEBXPAY, the e-commerce solutions enabler, made a splash in the market back in April 2016, with the express aim to enable SMEs to enter into the sphere of e-commerce at affordable cost without facing significant barriers. Within three short months, in June 2016, 100+ merchants signed up in its journey to contribute to financial inclusion and inclusive growth in Sri Lanka. Along its journey to transform the e-commerce space, WEBXPAY in January 2017 successfully concluded discussions with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to operate without any disruption on the basis of its experience and knowledge of the domain that the founders possessed.
There was no looking back after this, as by May 2018, WEBXPAY recorded Rs. 500,000,000 worth of transactions and on-boarded 1,000 merchants in two years of setting up operations. By this time, WEBXPAY’s acceptance was apparent in the fact that by June 2018 it had entered into partnerships with four leading local commercial banks, which linked their substantial base of customers to the benefit offered by WEBXPAY’s digital platform, enabling them to make their payments online for an extremely wide range of goods and services. 
Going from strength to strength, WEBXPAY continued to expand its portfolio of merchants – reaching 1,300 and recording Rs. 1,000,000,000 worth of transactions by February 2019, going on to increase the base to 1,700 by June 2020. WEBXPAY emerges as a key enabler for businesses, having to adopt e-commerce and digital payments overnight during the pandemic
Fulfilling a lacunae in the market, WEBXPAY went on to launch XWallet in July 2020, which empowered merchants to expand to as many as 13 payment options so that regardless of what method their customers used to make payments, they could be accepted by the merchants.
Enhancing customer convenience further, in July 2020 WEBXPAY introduced its mobile app, Xpos – a mobile application for merchants that offers them convenience and easy access to check transaction history, refund customer payments, generate invoices and send links to make payments – all through their smartphone!
Despite the pandemic situation prevailing in the country, WEBXPAY’s performance exceeded expectations, achieving a billing of Rs. 2.5 billion within five years of operations in the digital payment space by September and going on to expand to Rs. 3 billion to complete year 2020 and commemorate its fifth anniversary in the most befitting manner. The quantum of success it has achieved within five years has primed it to roll out even more ambitious plans for the future and customers can expect even greater trailblazing innovation from WEBXPAY going ahead.

LONDON (Reuters): Bitcoin fell sharply on Monday, losing ground from a record-high $ 34,800, touched a day earlier, with traders citing volatility in highly leveraged futures markets.
Bitcoin fell over 14% after earlier touching as high as $ 33,670, wiping out more than half its 20% rally from New Year's Eve to a record $ 34,800 on Sunday. Bitcoin was last down 9% at $ 30,077.
A functioning cryptocurrency derivatives market has developed since 2017, with offshore exchanges still offering highly leveraged trading. Moves in such markets can have an outsized effect on bitcoins price.
“It's the unwinding of some of that leverage,” said Richard Galvin of crypto-fund Digital Asset Capital Management.
Bitcoin's record-high came less than three weeks after it crossed $ 20,000 for the first time, on 16 December. The world's biggest cryptocurrency more than quadrupled in price last year.
Traders said bitcoin's drop on Monday was not unusual for the volatile asset, whose wild price swings have in part prevented it from becoming widely used as a currency.
“It's still an unavoidably volatile asset by its nature,” said Joseph Edwards of crypto brokerage Enigma Securities.
“For the most part, this looks like a purely technical move, signalled and caused by short-term euphoria,” he added.
Fuelling bitcoin's rally has been the perception it can act as a hedge against the risk of inflation as Governments and Central Banks turn on the stimulus taps to counter the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Some of it is reflecting the fear of a weaker dollar,” Bank of Singapore Currency Analyst Moh Siong Sim said of its most recent rally.
Bitcoin's advance has also reflected expectations it will become a mainstream payment method. Its potential for quick gains has also attracted demand from larger US investors.

SHANGHAI (REUTERS): The Yuan leapt nearly 1% against the dollar on the first trading day of the year on Monday, its biggest daily gain in about three months and breaching a key technical barrier that analysts say could extend last year's strong gains. 
The onshore yuan strengthened 6.7% in 2020, booking its first annual rise in three years, as a weaker US dollar, a widening yield gap between China and the United States, and effective coronavirus containment in the world's second-largest economy supported the Chinese unit. 
Prior to market opening, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate at 6.5408 per dollar, 159 pips or 0.24% weaker than the previous fix of 6.5249. In the spot market, the onshore yuan opened at 6.5195 per dollar and jumped to a high of 6.4670 at one point, its strongest level since 20 June 2018. By mid-day, the yuan was at 6.4702, 581 pips firmer than the previous late session close on 31 December 2020 and marching towards its best day since 9 October 2020. 
The currency also appears to have overcome immediate concerns about official efforts to curb any rally past key thresholds.

A representation of virtual currency Bitcoin is seen in front of a stock graph in this illustration taken - REUTERS

Reuters: Digital currency Bitcoin extended its record-smashing rally on Saturday, beginning the year with a surge over $30,000 for the first time, with ever more traders and investors betting that it is on its way to becoming a mainstream payment method.
The price of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency traded as high as $33,099 on Saturday, with almost all other markets closed over the first weekend in 2021. It was last up about 12% at $32,883.
Bitcoin advanced more than 300% in 2020, and with the latest leg higher has added more than 50% since crossing $20,000 just two weeks ago.
The blockchain currency has only been around for a decade or so, and in 2020 it has seen demand grow from larger US investors, attracted by its perceived inflation-hedging qualities and potential for quick gains, as well as expectations it would become a mainstream payments method.
Investors said limited supply of bitcoin — produced by so-called ‘mining’ computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles — has helped power upward moves over recent days.
Some also saw it as a safe-haven play during the COVID-19 pandemic, akin to gold.
“It’s very likely that the asset will eventually pass $100,000 per coin,” global blockchain project Chainlink’s Cofounder Sergey Nazarov wrote in an email on Saturday. “People have been steadily losing faith in their government currencies for years, and the monetary policies resulting from the economic impact of the coronavirus have only accelerated this decline.”
It trades on numerous exchanges, the largest of which is Coinbase, which is itself preparing to go public and become the first such platform to list on Wall Street.
Multiple competitor cryptocurrencies use similar blockchain, or electronic ledger, technology. Ethereum, the second biggest, gained 465% in 2020 and was up almost 7% on Saturday.

Foreign holding decreases to its lowest level since 2010 
Rupee depreciates during the year  


By Wealth Trust Securities

The Treasury bill and bond market ended the year 2020 as one of its most bullish years on record as yields decreased sharply throughout the year to historically low levels. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka slashed policy rates by 250 basis points each on its Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility (SLFR) during the year while the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) accounted for a drop of 300 basis points over the year as the COVID-19 pandemic took centre stage in the country. 
The easing to accommodative monitory policy stance of Central Bank during the year saw the one-year Treasury bill weighted average rate along with the 5-year and 10-year secondary market Treasury bond closing yields decrease to historic lows of 4.13%, 6.24% and 6.70% respectively against its year’s opening highs of 8.45%, 9.68% and 10.05% while trading activity and volumes hit all-time highs. 
Meanwhile, Overnight money market liquidity which started the year at a net surplus of Rs. 36.69 billion was seen peaking to over a 17-year high surplus of Rs. 242.91 billion to close the year at Rs. 206.75 billion. The weighted average on call money and repo which started the year at 7.50% and 7.53% respectively was seen closing the year at 4.55% and 4.57%. The Central Bank stock holding of Treasury bills and bonds skyrocketed to an historic high of Rs. 725.19 billion by the end of the year in comparison to its year’s opening level of Rs. 75.02 billion. 
Furthermore, foreign holding in Rupee bonds recorded a net outflow of Rs. 97.15 billion during the year to close the year at Rs. 6.88 billion, its lowest level since the 2010. 
The Rupee against the U.S dollar or USD/LKR rate on spot next contracts was seen depreciating during the year to close the year at Rs. 187.00/188.50 in comparison to its year’s opening spot level of Rs. 181.15/25. 
The year 2021 commenced on a bullish note as well with secondary market bond yields dipping on Friday to close the week ending 1 January 2021 lower in comparison to its previous weeks closings while activity picked up following consecutive weeks of very moderate activity. Buying interest, mainly on the short end of the yield curve saw yields on the 2022’s (i.e. 15.11.22 and 15.12.22), 2023’s (i.e. 15.01.23 and 01.10.23) and 2024’s (i.e. 15.06.24 and 15.09.24) dip to weekly lows of 5.60%, 5.62%, 5.70%, 5.90%, 6.38% and 6.40% respectively against its previous weeks closing of 5.65/75, 5.70/75, 5.73/80, 6.00/05, 6.37/47 and 6.40/48.

For myriad reasons, it is hard to say that the Central Bank policy per se is governed by MMT 

“We need a mechanism where money flows out to the economy directly and permanently” – Kikuo Iwata 

By Sumanasiri Liyanage

Two prominent economists in Sri Lanka, Dr. W.A. Wijewardene, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Prof. Sirimevan Colombage, Professor of Economics, Open University of Sri Lanka, published two articles in Daily FT last week criticising the extant monetary policy paradigm of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) alleging that the CBSL while distancing itself from inflation oriented policies has begun to follow closely the policy framework that derived from the main tenets of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). 
MMT as new discourse on the monetary-fiscal policy mix gained credence among left leaning Democrats especially during the presidential campaign in the US. Why is the issue of MMT raised in the Sri Lankan discourse? According to Prof. Colombage, Central Bank Governor Prof. W.D. Lakshman’s recent statement at an economic forum that domestic currency debt in a country with sovereign powers of money printing is not a huge problem is in close affinity with the MMT argument.
The two economists were unanimous over the issue that the continuation of present policy paradigm of the CBSL will necessarily lead to a disaster. Dr. Wijewardene in the form of a conversation between two popular teledrama characters, Ashini and Sarath Mahattaya, gave a clear and lucid narrative on the MMT tracing its historical roots. This is very useful to economic students. At the end of the conversation with his granddaughter, Sarath Mahattaya, Dr. Wijewardene’s narrator had concluded: “So, the present Government’s reliance on MMT is like getting a demon to work for it. If it does not play the game within limits, the demon will turn back and swallow it. This should be properly understood by the present Government’s top policymakers who advocate printing of money to pay for Government spending.” Of course, Dr. Wijewardene has admitted that the Government may borrow moderately. “What I mean by moderately is that money printing should not cause unwarranted unaffordable inflation.” 
Prof. Colombage seems to be more reserved giving the impression that MMT may be okay for advanced countries like the USA and Japan with reserved currency, but not for a small country like Sri Lanka. I am sure he may be thinking of the proposal by the former deputy governor at the Bank of Japan Kikuo Iwata. Moreover, he seems to think that MMT like policies are unavoidable at present conjuncture. He writes: “The recent monetary expansion points to imminent dangers in adopting MMT-style monetary policy in a country like Sri Lanka, though such policy stance might be unavoidable amidst the unprecedented economic setback caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.” 
This article intends neither to defend the extant monetary policy of the CBSL nor to posit that the main arguments of the MMT are correct. For myriad reasons, it is hard to say that the CBSL policy per se is governed by MMT. Nonetheless, the interpretation of the MMT given by Dr. Wijewardene and Prof. Colombage appears to have missed some of the complexities of the MMT argument as their contestation of the MMT seems to be based on the neo-classical and monetarist premise that money supply is exogeneous. On the contrary, post-Keynesians and MMT theorists posit that money supply is endogenous and linked with the effective demand. Hence, deficit financing does not necessarily lead to inflation.

Modern Monetary Theory
MMT proposes to bring the government to the fore. According to Randall Wray, the main weakness of macroeconomics texts and teaching today is that they start with unanswered question. Where does money come from? Modern macroeconomics skips this question leaving it to circular reasoning. As a result, in present day macroeconomics textbooks the government is brought in not in Chapter 1 as it should be, but in Chapter 8 or 10.
Secondly, the MMT may not be reduced to a notion that upholds deficit financing through printing money. It posits referring to historical evidence a nexus between printing money and redemption of tax. Hence, Dr. Wijewardene’s following statement is a result of simplistic reading of the MMT. Critiquing Stephanie Kelton, he writes: “One of the bold statements of Kelton is that taxes are charged for paying for government expenditure is mere fantasy. That is because there are many other ways of paying for such expenditure such as printing money. Governments can pay for expenditure by borrowing. When it comes to repaying, they can print money and repay the debt. So, there is no problem.”
Thirdly, MMT does not totally neglect as critics say the possibility of inflationary pressure as a result of deficit financing. It has its own explanation of the phenomena of inflationary pressure before achieving full employment and hyper-inflationary situations.   
A simple MMT macro model is adequate enough to demonstrate the complexities of its basic postulates. Scott Fullwiler’s MMT macro model that was derived from the famous Keynes, Kalecki Post-Keynesian identity (National Income equals National Expenditure), the key equations of the MMT read as follows:
Investment = Private Savings + (Tax – Government expenditure) + (Imports-Exports)
If Private Sector Surplus (PSS) equals Private Savings – Investment 
PSS = Government Deficit + Current Account Balance
So, PSS – Current Account Balance = Government Deficit
Suppose that the Current Account Balance remains unchanged, an increase in Government Deficit leads to increase in PSS that equals Wages Saved + (Profit – Investment). Assuming that all wages are consumed we may write the fundamental equation of MMT as follows:
Net Profit = (Profit – Investment) = Government Deficit     
The above equation shows that Government Deficit increases net Profit. 
MMT posits that an increase in government deficit leads to expand the economy that in turn leads to increase the tax base. 

Deficit finance and inflation
Can deficit finance lead to inflation? MMT has two answers to this question. Agreeing with the post-Keynesians, MMT posits that a continuous increase in money printing through deficit finance after achieving full employment would generate an inflationary pressure. If the resources are not fully employed, deficit financing would not necessarily lead to inflation. Besides, this full employment inflation, Randall shows that inflationary pressure may occur if increased government expenditure focuses on elite projects and highly skilled employment. Such an expenditure may create more what David Graeber called ‘bullshit jobs’.
MMT has multiple weaknesses. However, those weaknesses have nothing to with the critique of MMT by mainstream economists. If a country like Sri Lanka adopts deficit financing and printing money in a crisis situation, it is imperative such policies should be accompanied by import restrictions, proper direction of Government expenditure and increase of direct taxation. Nonetheless, the Government decision to dispossess Eastern Container Terminal (ECT) shows that its directionality is fundamentally wrong.
In lieu of conclusion, it is imperative to note without giving room for a misunderstanding that MMT as well as all the varieties of Keynesianism suffer from basic flaw. They seem to inverse the nexus between human labour, value and money. Michael Roberts has highlighted this in the following words: “They ignore that all the things that we need or use in society are the product of human labour power and under a capitalist economy where production is for profit (i.e., for money over the costs of production), not need, then money represents the socially necessary labour time expended. We see only money, not value, but money is only the representation of value in its universal form, namely abstract labour as measured in socially necessary labour time. It is a fetish to think that money is something that is outside and separate from value.” Anyway, this would be a subject for another article.

Renganathan and Chief Operating Officer Sanath Manatunge (3rd and 4th from left respectively), Dr. Janaki Kuruppu and CBC Finance Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Upul Dissanayake at the launch 

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC has announced the launch of CBC Finance Ltd., the Bank’s fully-owned Licenced Non-bank Finance Institution (NBFI), formerly known as Serendib Finance and Indra Finance.
The formal re-naming of the entity acquired by the Bank in 2014 marks the completion of its transition into the Commercial Bank Group. The restructured company will operate under its new name and new corporate logo from 30 December 2020, the Bank said.
With this relaunch, the finance company can be instantly identified with its parent company, the benchmark private bank in Sri Lanka and the most awarded bank in the country.
Commercial Bank renamed Indra Finance as Serendib Finance Limited after the company’s acquisition. Total assets of the company have increased from Rs. 1.95 billion in 2014 to Rs. 8 billion as at end November 2020. CBC Finance operates 10 branches island-wide, delivering a wide range of financial services including vehicle leasing, mortgage and business loans and fixed deposits.
CBC Finance’s Fitch rating AA-(lka) is driven by the rating agency’s view that its parent company, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC, the largest private commercial bank in Sri Lanka, would provide it with extraordinary support, if required. CBC Finance is a licensed finance company approved by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka under the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011.
Products offered by CBC Finance include leasing solutions for a wide range of vehicles and equipment including personal and commercial vehicles, special purpose vehicles, and agricultural equipment; fixed deposit facilities with attractive interest rates; and loan facilities including business loans, mortgage loans, and pledge loans. Its branches are located in Kandy, Colombo, Anuradhapura, Kaduruwela, Dambulla, Embilipitiya, Matara, Kiribathgoda, Kurunegala and Negombo.
The Company says it offers leasing customers the best lease rental rates and flexible payment options, tailor-made leasing packages, hassle-free documentation and quick approval processes, and special insurance packages. 
The first Sri Lankan bank to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World and the only Sri Lankan bank to be so listed for ten years consecutively, Commercial Bank, which won more than 50 international and local awards in 2019, operates a network of 268 branches and 880 ATMs in Sri Lanka. 
Commercial Bank’s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets; Myanmar, where it has a Microfinance company in Nay Pyi Taw; and the Maldives, where the Bank has a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake.

 Colombo Stock Exchange

 

Benchmark ASPI recorded a growth of 10.5% in 2020
2020 market turnover highest since 2011
Market capitalisation grown a trillion rupees since 12 May 2020
Increasing interest among local youth a key feature


The Sri Lankan stock market ended 2020 on a positive note yesterday, marking a year in which the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has seen indices indicate noteworthy resilience and attract record-breaking levels of trading activity. 
 
Market performance 
The benchmark All Share Price Index (ASPI) closed 2020 recording a growth of 10.5%, the highest annual increase the index has seen since 2014 and only the 12th occasion the index has seen a double digit percentage growth in CSE’s 35-year history. The ASPI ended 2020 on 6774.22 points. Sri Lanka’s ASPI was also recorded as the best performing stock market index for the month of September 2020, with the index recording a remarkable 12% growth during the month. 
The ASPI on 12 May 2020 recorded its lowest point in over a decade but recovered from this to post a 59% gain by the end of the year. Although the S&P SL20 index, which features the CSE’s 20 largest and most liquid stocks has declined by 10.1% in 2020, the index has recovered substantially indicating a trend similar to the ASPI with 57% growth since 12 May, closing at 2638.10 points as of 31 December 2020.
The overall value of the stock market, which is represented by the market capitalisation, has also improved adding Rs. 109 billion during 2020 and more substantially by Rs. 983 billion since 12 May. The market recorded a daily average turnover of Rs. 1.9 billion, this daily average turnover is the highest recorded for a year since 2011. The total turnover for the year was Rs. 397 billion which was also the highest since 2011.
Overall market activity in terms of the average number of trades carried out during a trading day also increased significantly, ending double the average figure recorded in 2019 and triple the figure recorded in 2018. This indicates high investor participation.
 
Local investor interest a key highlight 
A significant increase in CDS account openings was observed in 2020 with 17,600 new investors entering the market which is 70% higher than the number of new investors in 2019 and 56% higher than 2018. Local investors have contributed to approximately 79% of the total market turnover in 2020 which is higher when compared to approximately 63% in 2019 and 55% the year prior to that.
The year 2020 has also seen a greater interest among younger investors in the retail segment, with 46% of the total accounts opened being attributed to the 18-30 age group. This marks an interesting development considering the fact that a large portion of retail stock market investors have traditionally been above 50 years of age.
 
A capital outflow trend in terms of foreign investors 
On the foreign investment front, 2020 has recorded a net foreign outflow of Rs. 51 billion, largely in line with the foreign fund outflow trend recorded in emerging and frontier markets. However it is noteworthy that Sri Lankan equities attracted purchases worth Rs. 53 billion during 2020 by foreign investors, ending close to the Rs. 56 billion figure recorded in 2019. The stock market at present continues to indicate attractive valuations relative to other markets in the region. 
 
Growth initiatives 
The Colombo Stock Exchange also introduced a number a progressive growth measures during the year to enhance operational efficiencies and the attractiveness of the Sri Lankan stock market in the perspective of both investors and issuers.
The digitalisation drive of the Sri Lankan stock market which was implemented in 2020 has enabled end-to-end connectivity electronically at all stakeholder touchpoints and was implemented as an industry-wide exercise, bringing substantial convince to investors and operational efficiencies to stakeholders. 
During the year CSE also expanded the eligibility criteria for initial listing of shares on the Main Board and the Diri Savi Board to enable a wider spectrum of companies to qualify for a listing. Rule revisions, which were also carried out during the year brought about changes to the IPO timelines and the basis of allotting shares which were done to complement Sri Lanka’s rapidly developing commercial landscape comprising multiple business models and segments. The revisions were directed at improving the efficiency of the listing process while offering greater flexibility to companies listing on the CSE. 
 
2021 
Commenting on key developments to be expected in 2021, CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando said: “In 2021, major market infrastructure developments, product diversification, widening of the investor base, building a sustainable business model and more importantly working with the Government and the regulator to position the CSE as a pivotal point for capital raising are all on the cards. Increasing the number of companies listed on the exchange is one of the CSE’s key strategic objectives and we are making steady progress on this front. We look forward to enhancing the listing process and establishing a single window within the CSE for potential listings that would make a Public listing on the Exchange a smooth and efficient process.”   
Dumith went on to say, “Similar to the Real Estate Investment Trusts framework which was introduced in the final quarter of 2020, we are working on the creation of an OTC market for REPOs on corporate debt, trading of gold-backed products and stock borrowing and lending. On the Regulatory and Governance fronts, we believe the new SEC Act will be an important development covering regulatory changes required for continuing to safeguard investor rights, enabling the de-mutualisation of the CSE, facilitating new product development and strengthening the effectiveness of market regulation And of course we see many of the value drivers which have supported strong market performance since May, continuing into the new year. Thus we are entering 2021 on a hopeful but positive note.”

LONDON (Reuters): European shares fell on Thursday as lockdowns and rising COVID-19 cases overshadowed the optimism around the rollout of vaccines in the New Year, while the dollar fell to a two-and-a-half-year low.
Trading volumes were thin, with many traders away on New Year’s Eve and major European markets closed. Where markets were open, they failed to follow their Asian peers higher.
UK’s FTSE 100 fell 1.7% and France’s CAC 40 0.4%. US stock futures were 0.15% lower, pointing to a weaker open on Wall Street.
Despite a stimulus-charged rebound since the pandemic-induced market slump in March, most European markets have underperformed the United States and Asia, where a series of record highs have been reached.
The pan-European STOXX 600, which was closed on Thursday, recorded a 3.8% drop in 2020 as a rapid surge in coronavirus cases and worries about Brexit curbed improving sentiment.
Still, despite the rising COVID-19 cases and increasing unemployment, investors were betting the rollout of vaccines in 2021 will unleash an economic rebound spurred by plentiful fiscal and monetary cash.
Among the biggest developments in markets in 2020 has been the dramatic drop in the dollar. On Thursday, it hit its lowest since April 2018 and is now down 7.2% against a basket of currencies, its worst annual performance since 2017.
The dollar’s weakness, driven by bets that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates very low, has helped rival currencies.
The euro has been a big beneficiary and is up 10% in 2020 and was above $ 1.23 on Thursday.

BENGALURU (Reuters): Indian shares ended flat on Thursday, finishing a pandemic-ravaged year in which the equity benchmarks battled economic uncertainties to come out stronger, thanks to vaccine optimism and a slew of liquidity support measures.
The Nifty rose 14.9% to clock its best year since 2017, while the Sensex gained 15.75%.
The Nifty was flat at 13,981.75 after rising briefly to life-time high of 14,024.85 and the Sensex closed 0.01% higher at 47,751.33 on Thursday, as losses in IT firms and Reliance Industries offset gains in private sector lenders.
“Calendar year 2021 will be marked with hopes of early roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine, normalisation of activities and unperturbed growth recovery,” Jaideep Hansraj, MD and CEO of Kotak Securities said in a note.
The gap between large-cap shares and their smaller peers was sharp. The BSE MidCap index gained 19.87% this year, while the BSE SmallCap index jumped 32.11%.
The Nifty IT index rallied 55% in 2020, logging its best year since 2013, while the Nifty Phrama index logged a 60.6% rise.
Financials were among the worst performers this year, with the Nifty PSU bank index sliding more than 30%.
On Thursday, the IT index closed down 0.32% and the Pharma index settled 0.72% higher.

LONDON (Reuters): The dollar slid to its lowest in more than two years yesterday and riskier currencies gained, as investors looked past rising COVID-19 infections and the latest delay in US fiscal stimulus talks to bet on an economic recovery in 2021.
Lockdown measures in England will be extended, and US President-elect Joe Biden warned that it could take years for most Americans to be vaccinated against COVID-19 at current rates.
US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday blocked a vote on increasing COVID-19 relief payments to $ 2,000, adding another delay to fractious negotiations over fiscal stimulus.
But market sentiment was upbeat as investors remained optimistic that a stimulus deal will be eventually reached and that COVID-19 vaccines will facilitate a global economic recovery, lessening demand for the safe-haven dollar.
The latest setback “doesn’t really matter too much for investors, as they have been over the moon on the back of news that there is still plenty of fiscal support for the US economy”, Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said in a note.
Analysts expect the dollar to weaken further in 2021 as US President-elect Biden is expected to push for even more measures to support the US economy.
The “risk-on” moves in currency markets saw major currencies reach record levels in the Asian session yesterday, ease off as European markets opened, then hit new records as the European session continued.
At 1159 GMT, the dollar was down around 0.3% versus a basket of currencies at 89.737, having dropped as low as 89.681 shortly before 1100 GMT. The euro was up at $ 1.22715.
The Australian dollar – seen as a liquid proxy for global risk appetite – was up 0.8% on the day at 0.7664 at 1202 GMT. The New Zealand dollar also hit two-year highs.
The dollar lost out to the Japanese yen, with dollar-yen down 0.4% at 103.13.
In Europe, sentiment was buoyed by Britain becoming the first country in the world to approve the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.
The British pound was up against the dollar at $ 1.3607, but little changed against the euro, as traders returning from the Christmas break digested the Brexit deal struck on 24 December.
Although the agreement avoids a chaotic no-deal exit, it does not cover services, which make up 80% of the British economy.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia wrote in a note to clients that the lack of an equivalence framework for financial services in the deal and growing support for Scottish independence are new headwinds for the pound.
Euro zone Government bond yields edged up by around one to two basis points, with Germany’s benchmark 10-year yield at -0.562% at 1206 GMT.
There were some signs of increasing inflation expectations. Breakeven rates on 10-year TIPS, which measure expected annual inflation for the next decade, slipped to 1.962%.
 “The rapid growth in U.S. money supply and rising commodity prices are stirring up fears about a return of inflation,” wrote Schroders analysts in a note.
 “These concerns are reflected in inflation-linked securities, with the 10-year breakeven inflation rate in the U.S. having risen from 0.5% in March to just under 2% today,” they said.
The euro zone’s five-year, five-year inflation forward reached its highest since February earlier in December.
Elsewhere, Bitcoin reached a record high of $ 28,599.99, taking the yearly gain for the world’s most popular cryptocurrency past 295%.

LONDON (Reuters): Bitcoin yesterday jumped to a record $ 28,599.99, after the digital currency almost quadrupled in value this year amid heightened interest from bigger investors.
The world’s most popular cryptocurrency was last up 2.3% at $ 28,012. It has surged by nearly half since breaking $ 20,000 for the first time on 16 December.
Bitcoin has increasingly seen demand from larger US investors in particular, attracted by its perceived inflation-hedging qualities and potential for quick gains, as well as expectations it would become a mainstream payments method.
Investors said limited supply of bitcoin – produced by so-called “mining” computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles – has helped power upward moves over recent days.
Many recent entrants to the market are holding onto positions, they said.
“The supply side to the bitcoin market will remain tight,” said Jacob Skaaning of crypto hedge fund ARK36.
The latest gains took bitcoin’s market capitalisation past $ 518 billion, according to industry website CoinMarketCap.
Other major cryptocurrencies, which tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, were flat. Ethereum, the second biggest, was down 0.4%, on track for a 2020 gain of around 465%.

The core belief of the value of family is represented in CAL’s new logo, which depicts the interwoven layers of a nest.

The company has a refreshing approach to developing its people, thereby helping build an incredible team of professionals who understand the value of maintaining CAL’s impeccable reputation to reach new heights.
CAL’s core values of empathy, youthfulness, innovation, agility and advanced tech enables it to support its exclusive clients to make a transformation that accelerates business. Since inception, CAL has used its financial market expertise and keen understanding of client needs to deliver highly customised, innovative investment solutions for family-run corporations while retaining their family traditions.
Commenting on the new brand identity, CAL Group CEO Ajith Fernando said: “After 20 years of experience in investment banking and specialising in guiding family-run corporations, which are a prominent feature of Sri Lanka’s business landscape, our new logo brings out our empathy towards our clients, which is a core value we are known for. 
“At CAL, we understand that for a family, their business is not only about financial transactions, but an emotional investment that defines past and future generations.

Our new transformative logo mirrors these qualities. 
“Our own transformational new logo is also a way of showing our clients that change is necessary to meet the complex evolving needs of the markets, while our record for nurturing long-term relationships across multiple generations of a family business makes us the ideal partner on their journey.”
CAL’s resolve and innovative nature in the face of a more demanding investment banking market have brought it much recognition and acclaim. CAL won a total of four prestigious awards at the Global Banking and Finance Review awards 2015, including ‘Best Investment Banking Company Sri Lanka’, ‘Best Investment Banking Solutions Provider Sri Lanka’, ‘Best New Asset Management Company Sri Lanka’, and ‘Fastest Growing Unit Trust Manager Sri Lanka’.
CAL’s reputation as Sri Lanka’s leading investment bank has been based on its pursuit of excellence in execution, research and product innovation, and developing a specialisation in originating, trading and investing in debt and equity securities since the year 2000. CAL first entered the market in the year 2000 as a registered debt dealer. Thereafter, it was appointed as a registered primary dealer by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in 2003. The company asserted itself as one of only five non-bank licensed primary dealers in the country, and this standing authorises the company to distribute fixed income Government Securities to all investor categories including individual, corporate and institutional investors in Sri Lanka. 
Through the years, CAL has been able to develop a highly sought-after group of corporate clients, a factor that has contributed heavily to the company’s present stature and success.

Commercial Bank signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with BellVantage (a subsidiary of Melstacorp PLC, one of Sri Lanka’s premier conglomerates, managing a broad portfolio of businesses) to jointly provide the bank’s business owners with the SME.LK platform, enabling them to efficiently market and sell their products to the end consumers, as well as wholesale buyers, without an intermediary between the seller and the buyer. 
SME.LK is the only Sri Lankan platform to partner with a Sri Lankan bank and together they provide sellers with an online shopping store, offering free registration, and requiring no monthly fees. This covers an unlimited number of products and is valid for a lifetime. 
The platform provides a cost-effective and efficient means of marketing, order management, supply chain establishment, payment reconciliation, etc.
SME.LK facilitates trading for clients, producers, manufacturers, whole-sellers, and SME owners of Commercial Bank to sell their products from their home town, district and across the island.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) hosted the 24th SAFA Best Presented Annual Reports (BPA) Awards Ceremony in Colombo last week with 16 Sri Lankan companies bagging awards for excellence in financial reporting in South Asia. 
The SAFA BPA Awards organised by the South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA) is considered the most prestigious accolade for financial reporting in the South Asian region and has played a catalyst role in promoting excellence and effective communication in the presentation of high-quality, relevant, reliable and objective financial and non-financial information for over two decades. 
This year, 85 companies from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka vied for honours. Bangladesh’s Reliance Insurance Ltd. was adjudged the overall winner of the 24th SAFA BPA Awards, while Bangladesh also bagged the most number of awards at the event. 
Bangladesh received 20 awards, Sri Lanka secured 16 awards, Pakistan received eight awards, while India received two awards and Nepal received one award.

SAFA also recognised companies for corporate governance and integrated reporting, while a large number of companies also received certificates of merit.  
Three Sri Lankan companies were honoured with gold awards at the SAFA BPA Awards. National Savings Bank won the gold award for the Public Sector banks category, while The Nuwara Eliya Hotels Company PLC bagged the gold award under the Service category (Excluding Financial Services and Communication and IT Sector).

SAFA has been organising the BPA Awards since 1997. The Awards under different categories are conferred following a strict evaluation. 
Congratulating the companies which won, Jayesinghe also highlighted that these companies have a critical role to play in helping revive the region in a post COVID scenario. “The ongoing COVID pandemic has heightened the need for companies producing annual reports to be one step ahead, instead of limiting the report to conventional expectations. Ultimately, business agility will continue to be a fundamental change maker in this crisis,” he added. 
Heshana Kuruppu said that despite the challenging circumstance the corporate world faced this year following COVID, it was encouraging to receive applications from 85 companies from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka for the competition. “The awards under different categories are conferred based on a stringent evaluation administered by the SAFA Committee for Improvement in Transparency, Accountability and Governance which is chaired by CA Sri Lanka,” he added.

LONDON, REUTERS: World stocks edged closer to recent record highs and Asian shares hit a record peak on Wednesday, as investors bet on a strong economic recovery next year, with the upbeat mood pushing the safe-haven dollar to its lowest since April 2018.
Europe’s main markets were hoping for a sixth straight session of gains as AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s coronavirus vaccine became the second to be approved by Britain, helping the FTSE 100 add as much as 0.2% early on.
A new, more transmittable variant of the virus is spreading rapidly but European Union countries have also begun rolling out Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine this week.
Wall Street was set to open higher, too, with S&P 500 futures up 0.4%. U.S. stocks had retreated from an intraday record high on Tuesday after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had put off a vote on President Donald Trump’s call to increase COVID-19 relief checks.
The United States also detected its first-known case of the new, highly infectious coronavirus strains already spotted in Britain and South Africa.
MSCIs world stocks index remained upbeat, however, up 0.2% and within touching distance of the record highs it had set on Tuesday. The index is up 14% this year and nearly 70% from its March lows, boosted by trillions of dollars in global economic stimulus and hopes that coronavirus vaccines will re-open locked-down economies.

This year has been like no other for digital payments. Even as economies came to a standstill, consumers pivoted to online shopping and businesses turned to remote delivery and digital acceptance. 
The pandemic-fuelled adoption of all things digital uncovered distinct possibilities in consumer and business behaviour. Consumers formed brand new habits – using digital technology for work, working from home, and ordering online en masse. Here is a look at six such trends that we believe will shape the future of digital payments in Sri Lanka in 2021.

Mainstream emergence of integrated commerce
In early 2020, digital took centrestage as many offline and neighbourhood stores closed and some pivoted to remote delivery and payments. As the economy opened slowly, businesses started implementing new methods like buying online, delivery services and curb side pickup. A cohort of first-time e-commerce shoppers emerged. Consumer buying patterns and preferences also changed significantly with shoppers depending on stores that have an online presence.
2021 will see further evolution in this behaviour; as seen with online FMCG (household goods) purchases expected to grow from 20% to 70% on Daraz, one of the largest e-tailers in the country1 . Integrated commerce will not remain a fad but become commonplace with new-age distribution channels and market aggregators inserting themselves into the value chain. To provide seamless shopping experiences in this rapidly changing environment, businesses will become nimbler by focusing on app-centred buyers and a multi-channel strategy for consumers shopping online, in-app and in stores. Omni-channel commerce will come of age in 2021.

Rise of pay later 
There is a growing affinity towards credit-based products being witnessed in Sri Lanka over the past few years– indicating the vast opportunity in consumer credit. The acceleration to digital-first experiences this year changed consumer expectations on how and when they pay. 
With personal and discretionary expenditures plummeting, affordability has become a central theme, leading to businesses and consumers welcoming Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) options, injecting speed, flexibility and convenience in paying. The coming year will witness the explosion of mass affordability solutions triggered by the flexibility and benefits of BNPL options offered by merchants, manufacturers, marketplaces and, of course, banks and Fintechs. 

Contactless future
This year, in more ways than one, was about ‘contactless’. People used contactless cards not only for their convenience but also due to safety concerns, leading to an uptick in contactless payments in high footfall segments like grocery.
Besides the safety, speed and convenience of this method, the decision of the industry to increase contactless payment limits to Rs. 7,500 is opportune, as it expands the category of purchases which can be made by tap and pay mode, likely to be QSR, dining, fuel, supermarkets and pharmacies. Expect brand new categories to go contactless like transit and tolls. 

MSMEs to embrace digitisation
In 2020 MSMEs increasingly adopted digitisation as the year drastically altered the way businesses operate, whether to source materials, pay employees or accept payments from customers. In 2021, small business owners will continue to look for ways to stay connected to consumers and leverage digital marketplaces. 
In addition to gaining exposure to new segments, it will help them secure new leads, provide 24/7 access to products and create experiences for digital-first customers. Increased digital MSME footprint in turn will open the gates to MSME credit going mainstream in 2021.

No compromise on security 
World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 20202  pegs cyber-attacks to garner data/money amongst the top risks that businesses are likely to face in the year ahead. As businesses and consumers adopt digital payments for myriad needs, fraudsters too are getting smarter, putting payment security back in the spotlight. 
It will be crucial to consider checkout experiences and fraud activities, particularly with Card Not Present transactions, from the lens of payment security. Given the shift to online-first offerings, investments in cybersecurity and authentication will take precedence, especially for small businesses that are not as equipped to handle large-scale fraud as big firms. 
Redoubling business commitment to security will catalyse innovation in payment security. For our nascent digital payments journey to mature in 2021, a continued focus on Risk and Cybersecurity to protect consumers and keep fraudsters at bay is an area all of us in the payments industry have to be vigilant about.

LONDON, REUTERS: Global shares rose for the fourth straight day on Tuesday and oil followed suit as hopes of fresh U.S. stimulus teed up a strong end to the year for riskier assets and had the dollar eyeing two-and-a-half-year lows.
The MSCI World Index was up 0.4% at 1203 GMT, while U.S. stock futures pointed to a similar move at the open on Wall Street, tracking broad-based gains in Europe and overnight in Asia.
Across Europe, Britain’s blue-chip shares led regional markets higher on their first day of trading since the Christmas Eve agreement of a trade deal with the European Union.
The FTSE 100 rose 2.1%, on course for its fourth straight day of gains, led by companies in a range of sectors likely to benefit from the deal, including Intertek and Diageo.
Propping up the London market were banks and other financial services.
The launch of the European Union’s vaccination program, hoping to end the widespread lockdowns that have stalled economies across the bloc, saw that positive sentiment shared with the continent, where beaten-down travel and leisure stocks rose 2.3%.
The global stock gains and likely higher U.S. stock market open remain underpinned by hopes a $2.3 trillion stimulus package signed into law by President Trump on Sunday will be approved by the Senate.
The package covers $1.4 trillion in spending to fund government agencies and $892 billion in COVID-19 relief, including $2,000 relief cheques to help cushion the economic impact of the pandemic.

A Bloomberg study has revealed that the top five developing markets which could beat expectations are Thailand, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia, in that order
India, although garnering a middle rank of 11th, scored the highest in terms of expected GDP Growth in 2021
Thailand and Malaysia, among the top emerging markets in Southeast Asia, are likely to outperform expectations among 17 developing markets surveyed by Bloomberg. This according to a report published in December by Bloomberg investment strategist Simon Flint and co-authored by Michelle Jamrisko.
The report, which is not intended as investment advice, studied a total of 17 emerging markets and forecasts their potential for 2021 based on 11 indicators of economic and financial performance. The study revealed that the top five developing markets which could beat expectations are Thailand, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia in that order.
India, although garnering a middle rank of 11th, scored the highest in terms of expected GDP Growth in 2021 with analysts expecting the nation of 1.38 billion people to grow at a rate of 9%.
This is followed by China at 8.1% and then the Philippines at 7.5%. Thailand earned its number one ranking due to its strong foreign exchange reserves and high potential for portfolio inflows. Second-ranked Russia’s strength lay in its healthy external accounts, a strong fiscal profile as well as an undervalued ruble.
Taiwan and South Korea (joint third) have strong current account positions and foreign reserves, as well as an outstanding balance sheets. Taiwan and Malaysia (ranked fifth) also have good potential for portfolio inflows, and both actually scored better on that metric compared with Thailand.
Philippines, which ranks 10th overall, also has robust foreign exchange reserves, third-highest only behind Russia and Thailand. Malaysia which snared 5th position has an undervalued currency with z-score of negative 1.4. The z-score is obtained by determining a currency’s current real effective exchange rate (REER) and comparing that to its five-year average.
Other countries with currencies which are lower than their expected value include Brazil, Turkey and Hungary. Among all the countries surveyed, Malaysia stands to gain the most once the COVID-19 pandemic is under control.
The Bloomberg report uses Goldman Sachs’ effective lockdown indexes to measure the room that each country’s economy has to expand once normal business activities resume. Those indexes should all eventually converge near to zero. The other countries which stand to benefit most from lockdown relief are the Philippines and Chile.
China scored poorly in the study and in fact is in 17th position – last place. The reason being that the high expectations are already factored into the current markets and there is limited room to for investments to multiply compared with other markets on the list.
There is also concern with the valuation of China’s currency. Its valuation is third-highest based on Bloomberg’s computations and may tumble. On the flip side, its central bank may intervene should it strengthen. Brazil lags the others in 16th spot because of mounting fiscal deficit and debt concerns.
Poland, in 15th place, has a weak fiscal position as well as a potential for equity flows to revert to the mean. Other countries which risk equity flows mean reversion are Poland and India. Two countries that are potentially susceptible to an economic shock are Turkey (joint seventh) and Colombia (joint 12th) due to their high current account deficits of nearly 4% of GDP and poor net investment positions.
However, it should be noted that this is a superficial indication since other factors have to be considered. Australia and New Zealand are known to run average current account deficits of above 4% of GDP for decades without problems. Generally, the report says that many emerging market economies are poised to recoup economic loses, judging from the various metrics. Healthy foreign reserves, particularly in Asia, provide a cushion for external shocks, but elevated debt-to-GDP readings will be worth monitoring for stability risks. The report continues, “Developing-nation assets are headed for a back-to-back winning year, thanks to unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus deployed to fight the pandemic. As the global recovery takes hold, and the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low, risk appetite should continue to strengthen in 2021 amid favourable valuations and attractive real yields that lure foreign buyers.”
Bloomberg chief emerging markets economist, Ziad Daoud added, “The depth of the pandemic recession and speed of recovery from it differs widely across emerging markets. Countries that manage to contain the outbreak, introduce a large stimulus, have low exposure to the hardest-sectors and aren’t reliant on foreign capital will fare better.
China and Turkey are already at their pre-virus peak, although the latter relied on an unsustainable credit boom. India should get there by 1Q21. Chile and South Korea won’t be far behind - we expect them to catch up mid-2021.”

DFCC Bank, the premier commercial bank in Sri Lanka, has yet again proved its commitment as the ‘Bank for Everyone’ by winning the coveted ‘Best Post-COVID Innovation award, presented at the Sri Lanka Association for Software Services Companies (SLASSCOM) RPA Awards 2020. 
Falling under the Business Continuity Category, this accolade was received for the ‘Automated Debt Moratorium’ initiative, which automated the process of granting moratoriums to people or businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The SLASSCOM RPA (Robotic Process Automation) Awards, is a one-of-a-kind event in Sri Lanka, which includes the recognition and awarding of businesses that come together to innovate and redefine the world through their timely initiatives. Amidst the pandemic in 2020, the awards were held online, and DFCC Bank took home the prestigious award for ‘Best Post-COVID Innovation’, for the case study, ‘Automated Debt Moratorium’.
As per the circular introduced by the Sri Lankan Government, DFCC Bank had initiated the task of providing relief for the people and businesses affected by COVID-19, with moratoriums set to be granted for more than 10,000 loans. This strenuous process was estimated to take more than 145 man-days to manually process, while the safety measures taken by the bank to enable work from home posed additional challenges. 
This led to the decision to automate this process through RPA, which not only ensured the safety of our employees, but also improved the efficiency and accuracy of the moratorium updates. The phenomenally successful implementation of this complex process amidst the time restrictions faced, enabled this case study to be placed first at the SLASSCOM RPA Awards, setting a precedent in the banking industry.
Commenting on the award, DFCC CEO Lakshman Silva noted, “We are delighted at the recognition bestowed by SLASSCOM on our ‘Automated Debt Moratorium’ initiative. DFCC Bank has constantly strived to integrate technology into our processes to enhance the overall banking experience of our customers, and this recognition is further proof to that promise. 
Adopting emerging and disruptive technology has been at the forefront for us, and RPA is one of many such technologies ventured into by DFCC in 2019, which has helped automate a variety of processes. The knowledge gained in this period allowed for quick application to challenges that arose during the pandemic period. Now, we are both able to ensure the safety of our employees, which providing our customers with the appropriate relief needed, in an accurate and timely manner.”

People’s Bank the pioneers of Sri Lanka’s digital banking sphere, reached yet another milestone by launching its 100th People’s Wiz credit facility at the Bandarawela branch on 24 December.
‘People’s Wiz’ Retail Loan Originating System (RLOS) is one of the bank’s key innovative digital banking projects which enables bank to disburse personal loans within 24 hours with minimal documentation. Traditionally, a 15-step procedure had to be followed to grant a personal loan making the process take as long as a month. 
People’s Bank has always focused on offering a high quality customer experience using digital banking technology keeping in line with modern banking practices. Also, the bank’s digitisation projects were executed ensuring the maximum security and convenience for customer transactions. The People’s Bank Chairman Sujeewa Rajapakse commenting on this momentous achievement stated: “As per the Government’s ‘Vistas of Prosperity’ policy framework, every person in the country will be empowered by digital technology to face the modern world. As a state bank our intention is to take the benefits of digital banking to touch the lives of ordinary citizens and help them realise their dreams. Even during the lock down periods, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the bank took up the challenge to provide a continuous service to their customers through their digital banking platform.”
People’s Bank CEO/General Manager Ranjith Kodituwakku stated: “The main objective of the People’s Bank launching its digital banking systems is to provide simple yet effective solutions to our customers while enhancing security and efficiency.”
Further commenting on this aspect, he said: “With this revolutionary system the bank now has the capability of offering banking and financial services on par with the international industry as well. 
The project hopes to fill the gap between its customers and banking services, while bringing every stakeholder closer to the bank. Asia Money, Asian Banker and International Business Magazine and other leading award conferring institutions have honoured People’s Bank multiple times for its digital banking projects especially as they strive to cater to not just to businesses but to ordinary citizens as well.”
People’s Bank currently has established 240 Self Banking Units across the country to enhance accessibility and convenience to customers. These units include ATMs, CDMs and utility bill payment kiosks. Since these are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, customers can do most of their banking without visiting a branch.  
In addition to this People’s Bank has incorporated mobile technology to its banking services. People’s Wave app was introduced as their first step in this direction. 
It became the most downloaded financial app in Sri Lanka with over 900,000 downloads within a short period. People’s Wave and People’s Web lets customers carry out their transactions from the comforts of their homes. 
People’s Bank opened their first digital branch at York Street in Colombo. Since then, it has added most of the digital capabilities to all 348 branches.

Fitch Ratings (Singapore): Fitch Ratings has recalibrated its Sri Lankan National Rating scale to reflect changes in the relative creditworthiness among Sri Lankan issuers, following Fitch’s downgrade of the country’s sovereign rating to ‘CCC’ from ‘B-’ on 27 November. 
Fitch typically does not assign Outlooks or apply modifiers to sovereigns with a rating of ‘CCC’ or below. The recalibration will result in rating actions for some issuers with Sri Lankan national ratings. These rating revisions will be announced soon.
National scale ratings are a risk ranking of issuers in a particular market designed to help local investors differentiate risk. Sri Lanka’s national scale ratings are denoted by the unique identifier ‘(lka)’. Fitch adds this identifier to reflect the unique nature of the Sri Lankan national scale. National scales are not comparable with Fitch’s international ratings scales or with other countries’ national rating scales.

ICTA Director/Legal Advisor and Sri Lanka CERT Director Jayantha Fernando

 




The new normal requires new approaches and solutions, an imperative change that must be embraced by all sections of the economy to survive and to stay relevant.
The outbreak of the pandemic saw the country grappling to keep up with day to day activities, both on a personal and corporate level. One of the key challenges observed was in the areas of transacting for goods and services in what can be called an increasingly contactless word.
Although relevant authorities have pushed for Sri Lanka to move towards a cashless economy, it was during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 that people actively looked to use the digital payment infrastructure that is in place.
Across the world, including Sri Lanka, the digital modes of communications including payments are continuing to boom, thanks to the introduction of new technologies coupled with other developments to encourage the emergence of innovative ways of doing things, which leads to the creation of new business opportunities.
Information Communications Technology Agency (ICTA) has been in the forefront in driving the adoption of digital technologies and legal frameworks in the country especially within the Government. However, despite efforts to deploy platforms and technologies through by many stakeholders, the uptake has been slow largely due to the lack of awareness.
 
SL’s readiness to embrace the digital journey
Even before the crisis hit, Sri Lanka had all the necessary framework to embark on the digital journey, and the ability of consumers to make an immediate transition from manual to electronic transactions provide clear evidence that a strong foundation has already been laid.
Silent yet hard at work, the technology community has been well prepared and geared to address the challenges that arose from the ongoing pandemic situation to enable that day-to-day life to go on. From children being able to have their classes online to basic home delivery of consumer goods and services, Sri Lanka is seen making a mega transition towards this digital journey.
In order to enable this transition from a policy perspective, ICTA Director/Legal Advisor and Sri Lanka CERT Director Jayantha Fernando affirmed that Sri Lanka has the enabling legal framework to transform every form of physical activity that is carried out, into the digital medium, except for certain classes of instruments where notarisation is needed. 
“I believe and can firmly say that we have sufficient legal grounds to embrace this transition,” said Fernando. 
For instance, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) going completely digital is an example of efforts being stepped up to ensure the available technology is used to its fullest potential, leaving no room for any inefficiencies to creep in.
The upgraded digital experience of the CSE allows digital onboarding of customers, identity verification via digital means through the Department of Registration of Persons, and allows market participants to engage in the capital market with no hindrance.

The Electronic Transaction Act
Paving the way towards this digital journey is the Electronic Transactions Act, which is based on the standards established by United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996) and the UN Electronic Communications Convention (2005), the only international treaty on Digital Transactions. Sri Lanka became the first country in South Asia to adopt this convention, based on the initiatives taken by ICTA.
The Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006 was established to fulfil a number of objectives; to facilitate domestic and international electronic commerce by eliminating legal barriers and establishing legal certainty; to encourage the use of reliable forms of electronic commerce; to facilitate electronic filing of documents with Government and to promote efficient delivery of Government services by means of reliable forms of electronic communications, and to promote public confidence in the authenticity, integrity and reliability of data messages and electronic communications. 
The Act has ensured that electronic communication is officially and legally accepted as a proper means of communication. It applies to all business and commercial transactions, which are electronic in nature, other than wills or other testamentary dispositions, powers-of-attorney, sale or conveyance of immovable property, trusts, Bills of Exchange, and telecommunication licenses amongst a few others. The amendments introduced to the said act via the Act No. 25 of 2017, made this legislation fully in line with the UN Electronic Communication Convention (UN ECC), which was a further boost for cross-border digital transactions.

Digital signatures
Making the digital journey even more convenient to embark on is the ability to use digital signatures. Digital signatures essentially work by proving that a digital message or document was not modified, intentionally or unintentionally, from the time it was signed. This is done by generating a unique hash of the message or document and encrypting it using the sender’s private key. In addition, the sender is bound to the communication if a digital signature is affixed, thus, providing non-repudiation. 
In this context, Sri Lanka has been successful in in terms of cross border transactions as well, since the root key from the island nation is recognised globally from the beginning of this year, after its launch on 14 February 2020.
In 2009, Sri Lanka saw the launch of the first Certification Authority under the brand name LankaSign in accordance with the Electronic Transaction Act. This was established by LankaClear based on a request of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).
In the first phase, digital certificates were provided to banks for use in financial transaction clearing systems, such as SLIPS and CITS. 
During the second phase of development in 2011, digital certificates were provided to all sectors including their enterprise applications; SSL certificates and end user certificates on both private and public networks. LankaSign provided an affordable option to the Sri Lanka’s financial as well as other sectors and allowed them to automate documentation work, which was previously done manually.
ICTA’s Legal Advisor pointed out that the required necessary legal framework to facilitate the acceptance of digital or e-signatures is already in place. He stated that the Electronic Transactions Act (Section 7) gives digital signatures the same legal validity as traditional hand-written signatures, with a few differences. 
With regard to verifying the validity of digital signatures, what is required is a valid certificate from the signatory, and the complete issuer chain of certificates up to the root certificate. In addition, the signatory’s public key, issuer Certificate Status Protocol (CSP) certificates and their Certificate Revocation List (CRL) are also required. 

A seamless Work from Home (WFH) arrangement: Is SL capitalising enough?
While most enterprises have been focusing on their digital transformation the last few years, many are still utilising processes that have manual, physical, or face-to-face components and document signing is probably the best example of this.
According to Fernando, digital signatures actually help in the current context since there is reluctance at the moment to work on premise due to the outbreak of the pandemic. 
“The digital signatures are electronic equivalent of hand written signatures. A digital certificate issued from a trusted party would have a higher degree of validity attached to them, which ensures integrity to the transactions. What should be ideally done is for governments, corporates and SMEs to consider the option of using digitally signed documents, so that they can communicate those in electronic form to all participants in a transaction,” he said.
However, due to lack of awareness, most private organisations are somewhat reluctant to use digital certificates or digital signatures for their day to day transactions, he shared.
Fernando stressed that companies should embrace digital signatures since they are convenient, versatile, legally binding, secure and adaptable.

The choice of digital signatures 
This again is a business choice. Customers opting for digital signatures under the Electronic Transaction Act have a number of options across various categories. 
“In law we have left it to the trading parties to decide the category of electronic signatures they would like to use. One important feature of the Act is that we have kept the law technology neutral so that it can adapt to developments in technology,” said Fernando.
He added that under the law it is said that any method that helps to identify a person and to indicate that person’s intention in relation to an electronic communication would fall within the framework of an electronic signature and depending on the type of transaction the parties can use various methods. 
“So basically, customers and businesses have choices, they must pick what is suitable to them. My suggestion is to make that choice wisely and use a method that is secure, ensures integrity to the transactions and guarantees digital transactions are not tampered with. Digital signatures achieves this objectives and there are no legal barriers to use them” he said.

Data protection and privacy 
A complete transformation from paper to digital transactions, be it in Government or private sector, is the need of the hour. As measures are taken to identify and verify the identity of a person, protecting that in the digital world is imperative. 
Fernando shared that Sri Lanka has been examining this area and plans are afoot to fast track the Data Protection Bill. He Chairs the drafting committee responsible for this area, and drafted the Legislation that went through a public consultation process, which has received policy level approval.

Building blocks for empowering a Smart Sri Lanka at core of business strategy
A pioneering trailblazer in the financial services industry, Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB), which now stands among the Top Five Largest NBFIs in the country, added to its significant collective of accolades by being recognised within the Business Today (BT) Top 30. 
A fitting tribute to celebrate its 25th year, CDB has over the years prompted transformations in the corporate psyche of the financial services industry with its emphasis on an unbeatable formula of revolutionary innovation driven by a young dynamic team buying into a vision of financial inclusivity for a smart and sustainable Sri Lanka.
CDB gained its first nod into the prestigious BT Top 30 rankings just last year which recognizes published information by companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange and social considerations. This is the second consecutive year CDB has been recognised based on its performance for YE 31 March 2020.
But overcoming challenges remains integral to CDB’s success, a formula it has perfected since inception in 1995. Determination, fortitude and a strength of purpose has driven CDB to produce remarkable results by harnessing maximum potential emanating from the post war economic boom of the last decade with quantitative outcomes. Over this decade, CDB increased its profit 22 times, revenue and its deposit base nine times, saw its total assets and loan book also gain an upward trajectory 14 times and have its Earnings Per Share multiply 15 times. This is testament to a company doing things right, where stakeholder confidence has remained solid and unshaken. 
Having positioned itself as a game changer driving transformations in both the social and environmental spheres, CDB has embraced its 25th year to empower a smarter and sustainable Sri Lanka. Having empowered the aspirations of Sri Lankans across the country, MD/CEO Mahesh Nanayakkara accepts the laurels which he attributes to his highly motivated young team comprising ordinary people doing extraordinary things.  
“CDB has been recognised repeatedly for being a socially conscious environmentally responsible corporate citizen committed to financial inclusion for people of multiple demographics, diverse walks of life and businesses of all scales.  What you now see is a tapestry that has been woven over 25 years of a progressive story reflecting the passion and dedication of our team whose aspirations align on the commonality of empowering a smarter and sustainable Sri Lanka by providing access to financial services through technology enabled solutions.  We have infused a mindset of digital disruption and are now trailblazing a path of becoming a TechFin, which is the thread that binds our emphasis on people and sustainability into our core business operations.”     
Working on the equation of being a net lender to the rural economy on the formula of ‘Rural Lending – Urban Funding’, the strong building blocks of transformation, leadership, astute management and strategic vision built on a foundation of cutting edge technology has been the enabling factor for CDB’s numerous ‘firsts’. From being the first NBFI to invest in a core-banking system, to operating SLIPS, issue Visa debit cards, link up with the banking system’s ATM network, use social media networks for fund transfers and being the first ISO14064-1 carbon verified financial institution in South Asia continues that momentum of constant achievement.

Announces second debt moratorium for COVID-19 affected borrowers, looking beyond possible impacts to its own bottom line


Offering further assistance to its customers, Sampath Bank PLC extended the debt moratorium to COVID-19 affected businesses and individuals for a second time, from 1 October. This extension was well appreciated by all its customers, judging from the large volumes of applications received from individuals, proprietors, and businesses. 
Going beyond a singular focus on its own bottom line, the Bank has always strived to be empathetic to the needs of the people, especially as the pandemic continues to cause economic hardship to the nation today.
The second extension allowed affected customers engaged in tourism, direct and indirect export-related businesses including apparel, IT, tea, spices, plantation, logistic suppliers, event management and any sectors that have been adversely affected by work disruption to apply for a further three-month grace period. 
The scheme was also extended to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and individuals engaged in business sectors such as manufacturing, non-financial services, agriculture, construction, value addition and trading businesses including authorised domestic pharmaceutical suppliers, and individuals and businesses who must repay loans in foreign currency and whose incomes/businesses have been adversely affected. 
Furthermore, any business or individual whose business suffered due to local and overseas lockdowns resulting from COVID-19 as well as self-employment businesses and individuals who have lost their jobs or income due to the pandemic were also able to apply. These extensions were granted unreservedly by the bank, despite the significant costs incurred, and is a fitting reflection of its commitment to its customers in their time of need.
Earlier in the year, Sampath Bank introduced an array of relief measures for individuals and businesses affected by the pandemic which included moratoriums on certain loan repayments. The Bank also waived off all cheque return and stop payment charges until 30 September. Small and medium scale businesses and self-employed individuals were offered relief in making repayments on certain leasing facilities and customers with Sampath Bank personal loans or Sampath Leasing facilities of less than Rs. 1 million were provided relief in making repayments. In full compliance with directives issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, these measures were offered despite the Bank being aware of the pandemic’s possible impact on its own performance.
Extending its support further, Sampath Bank introduced an array of special business loans and gold loans at a significantly low interest rate of 9% p.a. under its Revive Sri Lanka initiative to help medium and large-scale businesses. The bank also waived off processing fees and penalties on early settlements and facilitated customer requests for a capital grace period of 12 months on capital loans and six months on working capital loans. 
A three-month gold loan at a significantly low interest rate of 9% p.a. was announced to support individuals and small-scale businesses with their urgent cash requirements which was again the lowest interest rate on gold loans in the market.
In line with the Sri Lankan Government’s intention to increase the use of solar power among commercial and residential sectors, the bank introduced a solar loan facility, especially tailor-made for projects to set up solar power units on the rooftops of domestic households and industrial   establishments. Under this loan scheme, owners of residential or commercial buildings could obtain loans to install solar power generating units up to a maximum of 50 KWh. 
These loans are offered at an interest rate of 8% while a maximum loan repayment period of up to 10 years can be granted. Factories and offices were also offered attractive interest rates, with a minimum of Rs. 50 million required to be taken. A maximum loan repayment period of up to 15 years was offered, with a six-month grace period obtainable if required.
The bank’s credit card customers saw a reduction in the interest rate to 15% from 28% for local transactions up to a cumulative value of Rs. 50,000 and minimum payment was lowered to 2.5% from 5% of the statement outstanding. SampathCards also offered 0% interest extended settlement plans on a wide range of essential expenses while the Sampath Bank app was upgraded to include a host of selfcare features which minimised the need to travel and offered greater convenience to customers. To provide customers with safe access to their funds during the lockdown, the Bank partnered with PickMe to enable the delivery of cash withdrawn from an ATM directly to the customer’s doorstep.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recently conducted a webinar titled ‘REITs: The way Forward and Opportunities,’ focusing on the newly introduced Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) Framework. The discussion also highlighted key features of this opportunity that can be a catalyst for multiple benefits for property owners, investors and the economy at large.  
The webinar featured capital market and financial services experts including the CA Sri Lanka Chairman Manil Jayesinghe, CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike, Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) Director Corporate Affairs Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma, CSE Chief Regulatory Officer Renuke Wijayawardhane, KPMG Sri Lanka Principal for Tax and Regulation Suresh R. I. Perera and Candor Holdings Group Director Ravi Abeysuriya.
SEC Director Corporate Affairs Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma during his remarks noted the importance and significance of the introduction and provided the audience with a comprehensive understanding of the framework to issue and manage REITs in Sri Lanka. “Upon the SEC issuing the gazette notification, the Sri Lankan capital market can now formally accept applications for creating REITs not only for commercial & residential properties meeting the criteria but also for infrastructure projects. It’s important to note that Sri Lankan REITs are allowed only as a listed security, mainly to promote transparency and to facilitate retail investor participation. In Sri Lanka the attractiveness of REITs is expected to be further enhanced owing to the Tax incentives included in the National Budget. Checks and Balances are included within the regulation framework to safeguard the interests of our investors whilst facilitating flexibility for the business case of REITs as an investment vehicle.”
It has been made mandatory within the Framework that a REIT be managed by a managing company licensed by the SEC and meet the basic criterions stipulated within the Listing Rules to qualify for a listing on the CSE. The real estate assets owned by the REIT would be required to meet the minimum threshold of Rs. 500 million at the point of listing, it is mandatory that all units issued pursuant to a REIT be listed, a 30% stake to be held by the sponsor or strategic investor which will be locked-in for a period of 06 months and 20% of the units issued be held by a minimum of 100 shareholders are some of the basic requirement that need to be met at the point of Listing a REIT.
Sharing remarks at the webinar, CSE Chief Regulatory Officer Renuke Wijayawardhane highlighted the steps involved with Listing a REIT on the CSE and the overview of the process. To provide a perspective on the regulatory environment upon issuing and listing a REIT, Renuke also elaborated on the numerous compliance requirements that a REIT would be subject to at the point of listing as well as on a continuous basis. “Similar to a listed company, REITs would be subject to compliance requirements in the best interest of all stakeholders involved and with focus on investor protection and maintaining a fair and orderly market.” 
Commenting on the timeline for issuing a REIT and the approval process, Renuke noted that initial approval for the REIT would have to be obtained through the SEC and the listing application should be forwarded to the CSE within a month of obtaining approval.  Renuke also highlighted the process with listing a REIT on the CSE and noted that it would only take around 50 days from the point CSE grants approval for the listing application up to the point of Listing the units and be made available for trading on the CSE.
KPMG Sri Lanka Principal for Tax and Regulation Suresh R. I. Perera shared his views in relation to tax issues that would affect a REIT. He pointed out that it is desirable that the intermediary, that is, the REIT vehicle should not be subject to tax or only for a very low tax situation and also said that most of the countries around the world in order to achieve this status has introduced specific REIT related tax provisions into their tax statutes. 
Suresh went on to explain the many complications, grey areas, that arise in the context of the current tax provisions. He flagged the tax issues and implications that arise in the context of current tax provisions to three stakeholders namely, the sponsor, REIT Trust and the investor. He also commented on the reliefs provided for REITS in the budget proposals presented in the Parliament recently.  The budget proposals have addressed capital gains tax on investors, stamp duty and dividend to investors in REIT units. “As dividend from quoted company shares at present attract tax, the tax-free status provided for dividends from REITs to investors would provide a competitive advantage for attracting investment into REITS from investors.”
CA Sri Lanka President Manil Jayesinghe shared  his views on governance implications for issuers and proactive governance with regards to safeguarding the rights of investors and  noted the importance of the independence of the property valuation that needs to be produced and the appointment of a specialised panel of advisors which would safeguard the interest of the unit holders.
Speaking during the webinar, Candor Holdings Group Director Ravi Abeysuriya noted seven specific benefits for an investor through the introduction of REITs on the CSE. The seven benefits highlighted were that an investor could invest in real estate with a small sum, diversify their investment portfolio, gain access to a liquid investment vehicle, secure a stable and recurrent income stream, the reduced risk associated with a REIT investment due to the transparency demanded through the listing rules, the easy understandability of the investment and that it also serves as a hedge against inflation rates in the country. 
Income generating property owners are invited to connect with the CSE to discuss how they can issue a REIT on the CSE in line with this attractive framework and unlock capital to fund their growth agenda. Comprehensive details on the framework could be obtained through www.cse.lk or by sending an email to maalik@cse.lk.

‘Oh fly and never tire,
Fly and never tire,
Fly and never tire,
There’s a great camp meeting in the Promised Land’
– An African American Spiritual, (Obama, 2020)






L Chiranthi Cooray Chief Transformation Officer of HNB

 




Shaping the arc of an elegant cruise ship requires carefully chartered navigation. Transforming a 132-year-old bank with a deep-rooted culture encompasses vision and passion blended with compassion. HNB’s journey to the promised land, to be a digital and future ready bank is a story that bears all these three facets; vision, passion and compassion. 
Courage to change, challenge and be different is a time-tested value espoused by Hatton National Bank and forms part of its corporate values. It is ingrained to the DNA of the bank and its people. 
We prepared for the arrival of 2020 with much anticipation, a few years ago. We changed many fundamentals in our business model and service ethos, to make banking enjoyable. HNB was a pioneering local bank which took bold strides into centralisation as early as 2003, with trade centralisation obtaining ISO 9001 certification in 2004 for its successful implementation. Thereon, the bank saw rapid acceleration of centralising operations, followed by retail credit, collections, recoveries, credit operations, credit administration and security repository, setting up centralised hubs for each of these areas. 
In 2013 we embarked on yet another first, setting up a Process Improvement and Change Management Department in the bank. This vertical was responsible for the introducing lean, six sigma and business process re-engineering of age-old processes handed down over generations, gotten quite unwieldy and inefficient over the years. Once the centralised hubs were set up, they were fitted will the right levels of skill, with the strategic intention of freeing up the branch network to engage in higher quality human to human (H2H) interactions with existing and potential customers. 
Project Everest, HNB’s bold transformation program, commenced in 2018, with a three-year timeline to drive digital, product, service, people and culture transformation through a bank-wide roll out. Year 2020 saw the culmination of most of the tech, digital, process and people transformation efforts in the bank despite COVID disruptions. There were many challenges to overcome in this journey. End to end process re-engineering, talent fitment to suit the newly created job roles, role-based training and certifications, creating new approval structures and workflows, setting up new verticals and organising the logistics around large concentrated workplaces were some of those. 
Possibly another first in a local bank, is the creation of strategic workforce planning and HR business partner roles, as well as communities of expertise for corporate HR within the high impact HR transformation roadmap. In all this, the single biggest challenge to overcome was embracing change. The readiness to change, lead, adapt and embrace change for one’s own self were difficult journeys for all of us. This is where the compassion quotient from the trilogy played its utmost role. Giving and receiving compassion with grace is an art we have as a team started to practice, making our Hatna family bonds stronger.  

Leading from the front, and taking people along 
‘Leading from the front, and taking people along’ is one personal favourite mantra. This served us well in this arduous journey. Our mission – take everyone along, leave no one behind. This meant that while most of us did the workload of one, some of us had to carry 1.5 times or 2 times the load. We did this, and we did it in style; in the true spirit of the Hatna family. In our journey of transformation, it was in these difficult moments, that we achieved perfect equilibrium among vision, passion and compassion. We strived to understand the difficulties our tenured staff faced in embracing change, and found many creative change interventions to ease their way into the journey. 
Our efforts in centralisation and instituting the brand-new branch operating model provided to be of great value to the bank’s stakeholders. The most welcome result of this long-term initiative was the improvement of asset quality, compliance, operational and credit controls and mitigation of risk, providing a safe and secure banking proposition to our customers who chose HNB to be their trusted wealth custodian. 

Communicate the expectation, enumerate the result 
Instituting a long-term bank-wide transformation is not complete without having the end goals clearly established. One of the first things we set out to do was, to engage our Top 100 leaders of the bank and through them galvanise the Hatna family. We engaged our unions extensively, onboarding them into our cross functional teams in the Transformation PMO. Communicating the expectations was a critical success factor. We strived to communicate our lofty ambitions in a clear, simple and transparent manner. We made it clear that no one was going to be left behind, no jobs will be cut. The messaging was simple, clear and credible. Our journey had a role and place for each and every team member. So, it was imperative that the expectation from our staff was clearly and simply communicated them. 
This brought about a great dividend of energy, enthusiasm and hope to our people, that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. This gave them a sense of purpose, belonging and a feeling of security. This is what held us together when the going got rough during tough market conditions due to Easter Sunday attacks and thereafter, COVID-19 business disruptions. 
We projected results and enumerated them. Our belief system held that ‘what gets measured gets done’. This was important for us to have focus and anchor milestone achievements to results. Our overarching vision was conceived to bear fruition through a highly detailed execution strategy. Weaving the success story of 5,000 people united under one goal, to be the partner in progress to the nation was our aim, and the driving force of our intentions. 

Adversity as an opportunity to serve 
Our efforts in digital transformation saw greater traction with the need to provide contactless banking solutions, payments and settlements in a COVID-struck environment. We rapidly accelerated our development work in wallet and digital layer, with our tech teams working round the clock to meet deadlines, while on the other hand our IT resources and capability was stretched to create safe and secure work from home systems to provide essential banking services. 
It was during this period that our internet, mobile and wallet registrations and transactions reached highest levels, as people had no choice but to move to digital platforms to fulfil their banking requirements. Being a bank, with a strong focus on financial inclusion, we mobilised our ATMs and cash recycler machines on floats, to far-off destinations, to provide access to cash to our fellow countrymen who faced food security issues during the first wave lockdown. 
We strive to offer a service par excellence; we achieve it most of the time. There are times, we ought to have done better. We recover those moments of truth with speed and tenacity, applying ourselves with rigour to resolve service issues seamlessly. Service excellence is a hard act to follow, day in day out across multiple customer touchpoints, and to not drop the baton, is a motto we embrace with great gusto. Our experience principles are deal easy, count on us, feel special and know you better. Our 24x7 omni channel contact centre, HNB Connect and Habio, our automated information assistant provide service to customers, giving digital power to the efforts of our committed staff who are serving in the frontlines.  

Play to win and play by the rules 
We are in it to win it. When we set out our transformation agenda, we created the strategy house pillars of business growth, customer experience, productivity, people development and tech enablement, with the foundation being business sustainability. 
Being a financial powerhouse, we uphold highest forms of ethics and governance. We believe the end does not justify the means. Therefore, our culture transformation is aimed at creating a happy and bright workplace of ethical and professional bankers. Happy people whose contentment is sourced from within, who come to our frontline to hold the HNB brand high, and serve our valued customers. Bright people who sparkle innovation and creativity. People who are curious, inventive and spirited. We draw inspiration from the rich history of 132 years behind us and walk into the future with hope and positivism, bound with a sense of Hatna family camaraderie that is truly a life transforming experience. 
Our transformative journey has provided us with rich lessons, we have triumphed in our victories, built courage in adversity and most of all, learnt humility, the greatest lesson of all. We unite as a team at the beginning of every year and observe multireligious faith reflections, and many spiritual observations through the year, because we as an organisation are united in faith, culture and tradition. This week, our Leadership Top 100 virtual strategy meeting ended with a digital opinion poll to describe the outlook for 2021 in one word. The Top 100 leaders of HNB rallied to name positive as the winning word. 

Through many dangers, toils and snares 
We have already come 
T’was Grace that brought us safe thus far 
And Grace will lead us home 
Yes, we are positive about the future. We are positive about our industry. We are positive about our nation.

At the reopening of Commercial Bank’s refurbished Galle Fort branch are (above) distinguished guests and staff that participated in the ceremony and (below) the bank’s Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe speaking at the event 

History and nostalgia came to the fore when the Galle Fort branch of the Commercial Bank of Ceylon was reopened in its original location this week in one of the last events of the bank’s 100th year.
The bank’s Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe, Managing Director S. Renganathan, Chief Operating Officer Sanath Manatunge and members of the corporate management graced the occasion when the early 19th century edifice at No. 22, Church Street was formally declared open following a refurbishment that restored its colonial grandeur.
One of the oldest buildings owned by Commercial Bank and one of the oldest buildings in the Southern Province, this building is listed as being the property of a George Henry Boggar, who is recorded as its first owner. 
It was also once a hotel named ‘Old Mansion’ and was the home of the Galle branch of the Mercantile Bank of India (MBI) when in 1973, the Commercial Bank of Ceylon acquired three branches of MBI and came into possession of this heritage building.
The building’s refurbishment was carried out in consultation with the Galle Heritage Foundation and the Department of Archeology, preserving the old structure wherever possible. The restoration encompassed a green concept including the installation of solar panels, use of specified green-rated raw materials, a facility to harvest rain water and facilities to recycle waste food in meal rooms and facilities to recycle un-perished material in an environmentally friendly manner. 
The formal reopening of this building took place on 15 December as one of the events planned for the centenary celebrations of the Commercial Bank. The three-storey building, complete with wooden floors, windows and doors that showcase the grandeur of the architecture of that era, also houses the bank’s Southern Regional Office, a mini auditorium, a mini museum displaying historical artifacts from the Bank and a staff holiday bungalow.  
Commercial Bank’s own history dates back to 1920 when its forerunner Eastern Bank was established in Ceylon. The present Commercial Bank of Ceylon was incorporated in 1969.
The bank celebrated its 100th anniversary with religious ceremonies representative of the four main religions of the country and a staff event which brought 4,000 staff from all corners of Sri Lanka to Colombo in January and February this year. 
The bank has also undertaken to establish 100 STEM classrooms that provide school students a novel learning experience in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics subjects, complete with a digitised curriculum, and to reforest 100 hectares of land as part of its centenary celebrations.

We as a responsible General Insurance solutions provider have taken measures to do our best to make it one less of a worry for our customers by ensuring convenience and utmost comfort of knowing that their vehicle is given the best possible protection.”

In the event of an accident, the respective claim will be processed once the remainder of the premium is settled. By way of this, customers are all given the opportunity to experience the convenience of full insurance rather than having doubt linger in their hearts and minds on what’s best for their precious vehicle, and I invite all customers to contact their nearest HNBGI Branch, to get their Pay As You Claim Policy today.”

Life insurance leader’s 39th owned branch building is town’s first green edifice







Ceylinco Life’s new green branch in Divulapitiya

 




Divulapitiya, a town straddling the Negombo-Mirigama road, witnessed the opening of its first ‘green building’ with the opening of a purpose-built branch office for Ceylinco Life on company-owned land.
The 39th owned branch building of Ceylinco Life overall, and the fourth in that category in the Gampaha District alone, this two-storey, 5,500 square foot building conforms to the environment-friendly specifications adopted by the life insurance leader for all new branch buildings on company-owned real estate.
Located at No 131, Mirigama Road, Divulapitiya, the building is powered entirely by a 20kW solar power system, resulting in zero consumption of electricity from the national grid, and has its own rainwater harvesting facility and its own waste water recycling plant, in keeping with Ceylinco Life’s commitment to the environment.
It is designed for optimal use of natural light and minimum consumption of pipe-borne water, is equipped with the latest energy-efficient lighting and air conditioning systems, and minimised timber use in construction. The company has also begun planting trees on the premises to further enhance the location’s green credentials. 
The building has a training facility for up to 50 people at a time and ample dedicated parking space for customers, the Company said. It will be the new home of the staff of Ceylinco Life’s Divulapitiya branch, opened in 2006 in rented space.
On 17 September, Ceylinco Life opened another purpose-built green branch building on company-owned land in Nelliady, Jaffna, after opening its 37th branch on company-owned land in Malabe in January this year. The company is in the process of constructing a green building for its branch in Piliyandala and is extending the capacity of its Negombo branch.
Ceylinco Life currently owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena, Mount Lavinia and Wellawatte, many of which have already been converted to solar energy. New branch buildings purpose-built to the company’s sustainable energy model are those at Horana, Panadura, Wennappuwa, Bandarawela, Chilaw, Kadawatha, Jaffna, Malabe and Divulapitiya.
Ceylinco Life operates the largest network of 250 plus branches in Sri Lanka’s life insurance industry, giving it a physical presence in 142 cities, towns and villages in every one of the island’s 25 districts. 
Sri Lanka’s leading life insurer for more than half of the 32 years it has been in existence, and certified as a ‘Great Workplace’ in Sri Lanka by Great Place to Work, Ceylinco Life was ranked the Most Valuable Life Insurance Brand in Sri Lanka by Brand Finance this year and declared the ‘Peoples Life Insurance Service Provider of the Year’ for the 14th consecutive year at the 2020 SLIM-Nielsen Peoples Awards. 
The company was ranked among the 10 ‘Most Admired Companies’ in the country by the International Chamber of Commerce, Sri Lanka (ICCSL) in 2019 and in the same year was named the ‘Best Life Insurer in Sri Lanka’ for the sixth consecutive year by World Finance, and ranked sixth overall in the Business Today ranking of the country’s top 30 companies.
Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies and is acknowledged as a benchmark in the local insurance sector for innovation, product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen as people walk in silhouette in the financial district of New York, US, 19 November – Reuters

LONDON (Reuters): Dividend payouts by the world’s biggest firms in 2020 will fall by 17.5%-20%, equivalent to some $263 billion, as a result of the coronavirus crisis, a recent report forecast, but could rebound strongly next year.
Although the prediction by investment firm Janus Henderson represents a smaller dividend drop than some had feared at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be the biggest since at least 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis.
Dividends are a major source of income for both public and private pension funds, but companies trying to cope with the coronavirus cut them by $55 billion, or 11.4%, in the third quarter after a $108 billion 22% plunge between April and June when uncertainty over the course of the pandemic peaked.
“Our best case now sees a fall of -17.5% to $1.20 trillion on an underlying basis. Our worst case sees underlying dividends declining -20.2% to $1.16 trillion,” Janus Henderson said.
However, some firms that axed payments have restarted them, even if at lower levels, while vaccine breakthroughs are also providing hope of a bounce back in 2021.
“This has been the worst year since the global financial crisis,” Jane Shoemake, Janus Henderson’s Investment Director for Global Equity Income, said.
“(But) if life starts to return to some form of normality even some of the hardest hit companies (such as travel, leisure and retail firms) will be able to start to pay dividends again.”
Next year’s rebound could be as high as 12% depending on the path of the pandemic and whether Europe’s banks are allowed to restart dividends again, the report estimated, although in a “worst-case scenario” they might flatline.
“We still have the winter to get through. It is not going to be a clear path.”

New top spot
Broken down by sector, the worst declines in Q3 were from consumer discretionary companies, down 43% in underlying terms, with carmakers and leisure companies making the deepest cuts.
Media, aerospace and banks were also severely impacted, while pharmaceuticals, food producers and food retailers all produced higher dividend payouts.
Geographically, Britain’s banks and oil firms meant its payouts fell nearly 42% on an underlying basis, while Australia which has also clamped down bank dividends saw a 40% drop.
US dividends were down 3.9%, with the impact felt in share buybacks instead. Japanese payouts fell 16% with exporters especially hard hit, whereas a 3.3% rise in China and near 10% jump in Hong Kong made for a rare bright spot.
Big tech has largely shrugged off the pandemic and Microsoft is set to become the world’s biggest dividend payer for the first time with a near 10% rise in its impending Q4 payout.
“In the last 10 years you have seen a massive shift... There are tech companies that are just throwing off so much cash,” Shoemake said.

U.S. dollars and other world currencies lie in a charity receptacle at Pearson international airport in Toronto - Reuters






Reuters: A recovery from the pandemic will be erratic but loose monetary policy around the world and vaccine optimism would keep risk assets supported, a global markets strategist at Invesco said recently.
Asia-Pacific equities, specifically markets in Greater China and North Asia, are expected to rise on COVID-19 containment measures, a rebound in economic activity and increased capital expenditure from the 5G rollout, David Chao, global markets strategist for Asia Pacific at Invesco, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.
“I am very much overweight equities over fixed income... 2021 could be a great year for emerging market (EM) stocks,” Chao said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit, 2021.
Stock markets in the United States are expected to go through a period of correction, Chao said, adding that a broader rotation into value and cyclical stocks in the near-term was likely.
“From a fundamental standpoint, widespread inoculation will fuel a pickup in global demand, which should see cyclicals and value stocks rally relative to growth,” he said.
From a valuation perspective, Chao said, the disparity between value stocks, at 17 times price-to-earnings (P-E), and growth stocks, at 38 times P-E, was greater than the early-2000 record.
“For a continued rally of value stocks, there needs to be economic growth, higher inflation, rising bond yields and improved corporate earnings, which will hinge on a vaccine being approved and available to the public,” he added.
Chao expected the US dollar to weaken in the first half of 2021 due to ample liquidity from the Federal Reserve’s ultra-loose monetary policies and additional fiscal stimulus measures.
For those same reasons and as a vaccine becomes available, Chao said inflation could “finally start to rear its head” in the second half of 2021.
“There will be a day of reckoning ... and the first sign will be inflation and then credit defaults. However, that day isn’t on the horizon just yet,” he said, while adding that those policies are needed globally to ensure the pandemic doesn’t cause permanent economic damage.

U.S. one hundred dollar notes are seen in this picture illustration - Reuters

LONDON (Reuters): A stronger US dollar will increasingly weigh on emerging-market economic prospects since developing countries have taken on so much dollar-denominated debt in the past decade, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) said last week.
The dollar has fallen by more than 12% from March-highs, after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to record lows. However, the BIS said the dollar remains prone to big swings and any reversal in risk sentiment could see it rise – hurting the growth outlook for emerging markets.
Using data from 21 emerging-market economies between 1990 and 2019, BIS researchers found that an increase of 1 percentage point in the dollar’s value against a basket of currencies led to a 0.3% drop in the growth outlook for those countries.
That was evident in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic this year, when a near 10% rise in the value of the dollar index in the first three months of 2020 resulted in record bond outflows from emerging markets and wider spreads.
“Emerging market economies (EMEs) are particularly vulnerable to changes in the value of the dollar through these channels, making the broad dollar exchange rate an EME-specific risk factor,” the BIS said.
Emerging-market US dollar-denominated debt as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product has tripled to nearly 10%, from around 3.5% during the global financial crisis in 2008. In addition, foreign ownership in their domestic bond markets stands at nearly 20%. 
A negative correlation between broad-based dollar strength and global growth occurs through various channels.
When investor risk appetite declines, flight to safety may both push up the dollar and weaken global economic activity through capital outflows and tighter financial conditions, as investors and lenders retrench from risky investments and borrowers.
A stronger dollar also weakens the balance sheets of those dollar borrowers, whose liabilities rise relative to their assets and tighter dollar credit can encourage global investors to cut their local currency bond holdings, including from countries whose currencies have not weakened sharply.

"Monday, 14 December 2020 03:19",DailyFT,"

LONDON (Reuters): US investment bank Morgan Stanley said on Monday it was taking “a few chips off the table” after a thundering rally in emerging markets over the last month.
The bank said it was sticking to its core view that developing economy currencies and select countries’ bonds would continue to climb, but was dialling back its bullish bets after November’s surge.
That included closing long positions on South Africa’s rand, which has surged 13% since June, tightening stop-losses on Latin American currencies like Brazil’s real and Mexico’s and Colombia’s pesos, and chopping back a bunch of bond bets including in Egypt and Ukraine.
“We see the rally in EM (emerging market) currencies being front-loaded into year-end and 1Q21, but then petering out,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts said. “We are also neutral on EM credit, where we think that spreads are close to bottoming out.” They said they were watching China’s credit cycle particularly closely.
“China could be the first among the major economies to start applying the brakes next year” in terms of stimulus, Morgan Stanley added, “and, when it does, markets will likely pay attention.” The currencies of commodity-producing countries are likely to suffer as they generally rally as China’s credit impulse intensifies and depreciate as it wanes.
A more encouraging signal could be an expected increase of the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) that is likely, in dollar terms, to be worth between $500 billion to over $1 trillion.
An SDR can be thought of as a credit token issued by the IMF to countries that can then exchange it for hard currency.
An increase would be supportive to emerging markets, in part because it would signal greater international co-operation, and could help debt-strained countries such as Sri Lanka, Kenya, Argentina, Bahrain, Ecuador, Ghana and Pakistan.
On average, a $500 billion equivalent increase would help boost foreign exchange reserves 21%-22% in Bahrain and Ecuador and more than 10% in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Ghana.
“It could (also) increase expectations of further financial aid if required,” Morgan Stanley said.

Seylan Bank Director and CEO Kapila Ariyaratne

Seylan Bank has affirmed its position among the topmost corporates in the country by featuring in the Business Today Top 30 ranking for listed entities. Despite the many challenges posed by unprecedented events during the year, the stability and unwavering commitment to excellence has ensured the presence of the ‘Bank with a Heart’ in this elite ranking, the company announced.
Listed entities made it to the ranking for the financial year 2019-2020, with the companies being evaluated on performance and their focus on sustainable business practices with social consideration. Seylan Bank has been in the forefront of innovation and customer service, ensuring the Bank’s customers got the best service in the limited operating environment afforded by the pandemic and the Bank continued to support its clientele in all its financial needs.
“Throughout this financial year, the Bank has operated in a challenging environment with unprecedented upheavals. Despite the negativity that surrounded us, I am grateful for efforts of the Seylan Team in achieving the results we did both in terms of our own financials, but also in assisting our wide network of customers to overcome extremely difficult economic conditions. Our presence in this august ranking is an affirmation that we are on the right path, and that we will come out on top with innovation and a growth mindset,” Seylan Bank CEO Kapila Ariyaratne stated, commenting on the recognition.
In ranking Seylan Bank as a top corporate, the listing also considered the Bank’s social responsibility. This year, Seylan developed and implemented an environmental and social management policy to ensure sustainability through reduction of the environmental and social impact from commercial activity. The policy is structured to create economic prosperity while protecting the environment.
“Seylan Bank was endorsed as a financially stable organisation with performance excellence across the board by Fitch Ratings earlier this year, with the bank’s national long-term rating revised to ‘A’ (lka). The bank was also ranked second among public listed companies for transparency in corporate reporting by Transparency Global and is now part of the S&P Dow Jones SL 20 Index. These achievements are a testament to Seylan Bank’s financial stability and unwavering dedication to ensuring excellence across all aspects,” Ariyaratne added.
Seylan Bank has always been the growth partner of choice for SME customers, focusing on their needs during the pandemic and also established 13 regional credit hubs to improve the interaction with and speed of delivery to the SME clientele. The Bank is fully committed to engage with this important segment of the nation’s economy and nurture its growth as the economy rallies. The bank upgraded its digital infrastructure to provide better value and convenience to customers through a more user-friendly digital banking environment, a strategy that proved immediate value in the backdrop of the island wide lockdown earlier in the year when Seylan customers received uninterrupted service despite being confined to their homes.
The Business Today Top 30 is based on published information of companies listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange and social considerations. The companies have been selected on the basis of their performance recorded during the financial year ending 31 December 2019 and 31 March 2020 with the assistance of KPMG Sri Lanka.
Seylan Bank, the Bank with a Heart, operates with a vision to offer the ultimate banking experience to its valued customers through cutting-edge technology, innovative products, and best-in-class services. The Bank has a growing clientele of SMEs, retail and corporate customers, and has expanded its footprint with 173 branches, 70 Cash Deposit Machines, 66 Cheque Deposit Machines, and an ATM network of 216 units across the country.

Arpico Insurance General Manager – Sales H.E.T. Sampath speaking at the occasion



 





Arpico Insurance General Manager – Sales N.C.P. Nishan speaking at the occasion




Remaining true to its unparalleled commitment and purpose of standing by its customers in their hour-of-need, Sri Lanka’s most innovative insurance solutions provider, Arpico Insurance PLC, recently introduced a specialised insurance policy for COVID-19 – Arpico COVIDCARE – further solidifying the Company’s commitment to provide ‘Insurance for the Living’ as envisioned by Company Founder and Group Chairman of Richard Peiris, Dr. Sena Yaddehige. 
Under this specialised policy, three distinct policy options will be availed to suit the customers’ requirements and budget. Some of the benefits offered via this insurance cover include up to Rs. 1,500,000 in the event of death due to COVID-19 or accident, daily hospitalisation benefits up to Rs. 5,000 per day for quarantine in a Government-approved facility, reimbursement of ICU medical costs of up to Rs. 200,000 due to COVID-19, reimbursement of up to Rs. 5,000 for COVID-19 vaccination as well as funeral expenses up to Rs. 50,000 for death due to COVID-19 or accident.
Commenting at the launch of Arpico COVIDCARE, Dr. Sena Yaddehige mentioned that Arpico Insurance PLC is one of the first insurance providers in both Sri Lanka and in the region to have promptly responded with a creative solution to the raging pandemic: “This is very much in line with our corporate philosophy of providing ‘Insurance for the Living’. We have designed this policy to include maximum benefits for a reasonable premium which also aligns with our commitment to making insurance accessible to all citizens without exception.”
“The insurance industry in Sri Lanka has continuously stood by its clients through some of the most trying times such as the catastrophic tsunami of 2004, the April 2019 Easter bombings and numerous other natural disasters and calamities. We noticed a void as well as a need in the market for a specialised plan as what is already available is not designed specifically to cater to a pandemic outbreak, such as what we are currently experiencing. Creating a new product in a short span of time, under challenging circumstances, is no easy feat and credit goes out to our exceptionally talented team at Arpico Insurance PLC for rising to the occasion as always,” he added.

Being an Insurance service provider that is being driven by innovation and service excellence, Arpico Insurance has and will always remain committed to provide an exceptional level of service to its clients while upholding it’s values and doing their part to take the industry to new heights.”
Further information about this insurance cover can be obtained by contacting 0112 200 900. 
Arpico Insurance PLC was incorporated in 2011 and is a regulated insurance company under the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka. The renowned insurance provider presently offers a range of products such as endowment, term assurance, education, investment, retirement, group assurance and loan protection amongst others and takes pride in being the only Life Insurance company that remains committed in providing Insurance for the living.

Five more draws to be conducted in 2021
More than 600 customers to win Rs. 30 million in gold


A click of a mouse, the whir of a hard disk and a fortune in gold was gifted to a group of lucky policyholders of Ceylinco Life as the life insurance leader’s ‘new normal’ Family Savari promotion conducted its first draw.
The first batch of winners comprising 103 policyholders won Rs. 5 million in gold, with one of them receiving the equivalent of Rs. 1 million, two winning Rs. 250,000 each, five receiving Rs. 100,000 each, 25 getting Rs. 50,000 each and another 70 receiving Rs. 25,000 each.
Five more draws are to be conducted in 2021, culminating in more than 600 Ceylinco Life policyholders winning Rs. 30 million in gold via the 14th edition of the Family Savari mega promotion. The decision to present policyholders with gold instead of the customary overseas holidays and local excursions was on account of the travel restrictions and safety precautions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Winners chosen at the first draw came from areas as diverse as Trincomalee, Wennappuwa, Nelliaddy, Matara and Nochchiyagama.
To be eligible to participate in the six bi-monthly Family Savari draws, Ceylinco Life customers are required to keep their life insurance or retirement plans active between September 2020 and August 2021.
Additional winning chances are given to customers who pay their premiums directly to the company and further chances are assigned corresponding to the time they have been Ceylinco Life customers. New policyholders who obtain life insurance in the promotion period and pay a minimum of three monthly premiums are also eligible to participate, the company said.
Intended to stimulate interest in life insurance, encourage policyholders to keep their policies active and to promote the value of family time and unity, the Family Savari program has benefitted more than 26,000 people in the past 13 years. Grand-prize winning families at previous Family Savari promotions have visited Australia, Italy, England, Germany, Switzerland, Japan and France, while other winners have toured China, Dubai and Singapore.
Ceylinco Life’s Family Savari program is promoted by four popular brand ambassadors, the Sri Lankan actors Sriyantha Mendis, Sanjeewani Weerasinghe and Roshan Ranawana and his wife Kushlani who in past editions joined the policyholders on their overseas holidays and local excursions.

Seema Kharbay travelled to the US in 2008 and 2009, and bought two hefty life insurance policies in her name


PTI (Karachi): Pakistani authorities have launched an investigation after a woman fraudulently got herself declared dead and claimed two life insurance policies worth $ 1.5 million.
According to an official of the Federal Investigating Agency (FIA), which is looking into the case, Seema Kharbay travelled to the US in 2008 and 2009, and bought two hefty life insurance policies in her name.
In 2011, she bribed some local government officials in Pakistan including a doctor and got a death certificate issued in her name.
The document also showed that she had been buried.
The certificate was used by her children to claim two life insurance policy payouts worth $ 1.5 million, the official said.
Kharbay, after being declared dead, travelled at least 10 times abroad from the Karachi International Airport, apparently under assumed identities with none of the airlines being able to detect the fraud.
""She visited some five countries, but every time she returned home,"" the official said.
The FIA human trafficking cell has now registered criminal cases against the woman, her son and daughter and some local government officials, including a doctor.
""The American authorities alerted us about this woman and we started investigation into this large-scale fraud,"" the official added.

Bell ringing ceremony

By Darshana Abayasingha







CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando


 





CSE past Chairman Ajit Jayaratne


 





SEC Chairman Viraj Dayaratne PC



The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) marked its 35th anniversary yesterday, with a special bell ringing ceremony at the bourse. 
The event was titled ‘A Transformative Past – A Vibrant Future’ and CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando said major market infrastructure developments were on the cards with emphasis on product diversification and building a sustainable business model for the bourse as it takes on the next 35 years and more. 
The event was attended by past Chairman of the bourse, Ajit Jayaratne, who reminisced the days when the CSE consisted of just four brokers, before things dramatically changed in 1977. He identified the setup of the Central Depository System as a game changer in the journey of the stock exchange and for its stakeholders.
In 2020, the CSE and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) engaged in a transformative project to digitalise all stakeholder touch points in the bourse, enabling end-to-end connectivity, which is vital to broad-base the stock market and provide market accessibility to all Sri Lankans. 
Establishing regulatory readiness to navigate through a Sri Lankan business landscape that has changed substantially since the CSE was first established has been a material focus in 2020. Expanding listing rules to pave the way for a wider spectrum of companies to qualify for a listing and the introduction of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are other developments that took place this year.
“We must think of greater achievements, even though these are difficult times this can be the best time for unprecedented measures. The Stock Exchange should be the place to raise capital, and to attract more listings we need to do much more. The SEC will extend its fullest support to make the targets a reality. I think we should recognise the initiatives of the Government to develop the capital market. Whilst developing the market, we must maintain the integrity of the market and the SEC will not waiver in this resolve, but it’s a responsibility for all stakeholders,” said SEC Chairman Viraj Dayaratne.

NSB and SLSB loan program for December

 
National Savings Bank (NSB), in collaboration with one of its fully-owned subsidiaries, Sri Lanka Savings Bank (SLSB), has planned to introduce a special loan scheme to offer credit facilities under a lower interest rate with a view to accelerating the development of the shrimp farming industry in Sri Lanka.   
The shrimp farming industry in Sri Lanka, which came into being around 30 years ago, could be identified as a higher value generating sector among the industries based on aquaculture in the country.   
With the objective of achieving a sustainable development in the shrimp farming industry in the country, Sri Lanka Aquaculture Development Alliance has been established 15 years back and the permanent members of this organisation will be able to obtain loan facilities within a value range of Rs. 1 million to Rs. 100 million under this loan scheme.
This Alliance comprises of 18 farmers’ societies, breeding cent societies, seafood societies and shrimp feed societies in Puttalam District, in which the shrimp farming industry is mainly centralised. The Alliance operates the shrimp farming industry, in coordination with the National Aquaculture Development Authority of Sri Lanka, the main state-sponsored organisation mandated for the task of development of the aquaculture and inland fisheries sector in Sri Lanka and other Government institutions. Further, the membership of this alliance represents the entire shrimp farming industry of the country.   
According to the Alliance, even if the species of prawns with a steady growth and free of diseases are introduced, farmers undergo many difficulties in obtaining financial facilities required to duly process and maintain the farms as per the conditions and requirements to be met when rearing such species. Therefore, the Alliance firmly believes that that the proposed loan scheme by National Savings Bank and Sri Lanka Savings Bank would ensure a progressive opportunity for the individuals engaged in this sector to expand their businesses.
With the introduction of the said loan scheme, NSB expects to back the national course of expanding the shrimp farming industry by incorporating high tech methodologies and equipment and thereby generating more employment opportunities, which has become a necessity in the face of the high demand for prawns in the world market and the requirement of further diversifying the exports in Sri Lanka instead of depending on the traditional export sectors such as tea, rubber, coconut and garments. NSB thus contributes to realise the Government’s vision of increasing the exports of the country while reducing the imports to promote local industries and production as stipulated by ‘Saubhagye Dekma’ (Vision of Prosperity).    
NSB Chairperson Keasila Jayawardena, Sri Lanka Aquaculture Development Alliance Chairman Sarath Kithsiri and several other officials of the Alliance, some of the Deputy General Managers of NSB and some officers of SLSB were present at the initial discussions held in this regard recently.

Glove Manufacturing at Dipped Products PLC 


SCB extends $ 5.5 million to Midas Safety Sri Lanka to increase production of medical gloves 
$ 3.6 m to Dipped Products to add new production lines for personal protective gloves 
Haycarb gets $ 1.5 m to upgrade and expand in-house manufacturing and warehousing facility and increase mask production


Standard Chartered Sri Lanka yesterday announced the facilitation of financing for Industrial Clothing Ltd. (Midas Safety Sri Lanka) as well as Hayleys PLC’s subsidiaries Dipped Products PLC and Haycarb PLC to enhance their manufacturing capacity of essential personal protective equipment (PPE) for the global fight against COVID-19.
These companies were the latest Sri Lanka-based clients to complete a drawdown from the bank’s global $1 billion not-for-profit financing.
In the face of the global pandemic, many companies, including members of the apparel industry in South Asia, switched to manufacturing and distributing high demand products such as face masks, ventilators, sanitisers and other PPE products. Standard Chartered launched the not-for-profit global financing initiative in March 2020 to support such efforts. To date, the bank has provided more than $ 45 million in lending and working capital to companies in Sri Lanka under this program. 
Commenting on the bank’s ongoing efforts to support local businesses in combating COVID-19, Standard Chartered Sri Lanka CEO Bingumal Thewarathanthri said: “Access to funds is a key factor in business recovery following a crisis of this magnitude. At Standard Chartered, our focus has been on supporting our long-standing and new partners to recover fully, and to contribute to the fight against the pandemic. Sri Lanka was the first South Asian market where we extended a facility from the $ 1 billion financing commitment, and we are pleased to continue supporting more local businesses to drive the country’s economic recovery.” 
The bank extended a $5.5 million loan to Midas Safety Sri Lanka which enabled it to increase production of medical gloves and meet growing demand globally. 
A $3.6 million loan to Dipped Products PLC helped it add new production lines for personal protective gloves destined for the US and the EU. 
Haycarb PLC, a manufacturer of charcoal-based activated carbon for purification, stepped up its face mask manufacturing operations with the upgrade and expansion of its in-house manufacturing and warehousing facility and increased its mask production for both domestic and export markets, all with the help of a $ 1.5 million loan facility from Standard Chartered. 
“Standard Chartered has a global commitment to contribute effort to combat COVID-19 at a time when our clients need our support more than ever. We will continue to work with our clients and extend financing support to help their businesses recover from this challenging period,” said Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Head, Local and International Corporates Tamani Dias.
The Sri Lankan apparel industry, the country’s largest contributor to its export revenue, came to a standstill as a result of the global pandemic and a nationwide lockdown earlier this year. Through the Standard Chartered not-for-profit financing commitment, the bank facilitated the financial requirements of leading garment manufacturers MAS Intimates and Brandix in June and July 2020 respectively, to produce and export PPE to markets including the US.

Fitch Ratings warned yesterday that Sri Lanka’s Banking Sector’s downside risks have been elevated, whilst the industry’s credit profile can be impacted further. It said the latest assessment on the Banking Industry was following the sovereign’s weakened credit profile, consequent to Fitch’s downgrade of Sri Lanka’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to ‘CCC’ underscored by relatively sluggish economic activity, external and domestic vulnerabilities and muted private credit growth.
“These factors could in turn impair banks’ credit profiles further – in particular asset quality, profitability and access to foreign-currency funding,” Fitch added in its latest ‘2021 Outlook: Asia-Pacific Emerging Market Banks’. Fitch also said the rating outlook for SL banks is negative.
Following are excerpts from the coverage on Sri Lanka.

Fitch’s Sector Outlook: Stable
Fitch sees the Sri Lankan Banking Sector’s new business and revenue generation prospects in 2021 remaining broadly similar to those in 2020, despite a lingering impact from the pandemic. However, downside risks are elevated due to the sovereign’s weakened credit profile as reflected in Sri Lanka’s ‘CCC’ IDR, underscored by relatively sluggish economic activity, external and domestic vulnerabilities and muted private credit growth. These factors could in turn impair banks’ credit profiles further – in particular asset quality, profitability and access to foreign-currency funding.

Rating Outlook: Negative
Our negative rating outlook is anchored to our negative outlook on the operating environment, which is a high influencing factor for banks’ VRs. However, the banks’ ratings remain under pressure on account of the sovereign’s weakened credit profile.

What to Watch
Economic Recovery; Government Fiscal Position
Sri Lanka’s economic growth prospects will depend largely on how the pandemic progresses both in the country and globally, and also the potential spillover effects of the sovereign’s heightened external debt repayment challenges on the domestic economy. We expect real GDP to contract by 6.7% in 2020 versus our earlier estimate of 3.7%, before rising to 4.9% in 2021, from a lower base.
State demand for credit on the back of the sovereign’s weak fiscal position could be supportive of loan growth for the sector, particularly for State Banks, and partly offset weak private-sector sentiment and demand. Albeit, it would increase these banks’ concentration risk to the fiscally weak State Sector.

Asset Quality to remain weak
Fitch expects underlying asset-quality stress to continue into 2021 as regulatory relief measures – which have delayed the recognition of the build-up – taper off. We estimate loans under moratorium accounted for at least 26% of the Fitch-rated banks’ loans at end-June 2020, with restructured loans rising even prior to the onset of the pandemic, reflecting the potential pressure on banks’ impaired loans. 
Any possible pick-up in loan growth can have a sobering impact on the impaired-loan ratio, which will have to be seen against the pace and quality of economic recovery that we expect.

Profitability Hinges on Loan Growth, Credit Costs
Any improvement in profitability in 2021 is likely to stem from a pick-up in loan growth and a softer rise in credit costs, as banks build up loan-loss buffers further this year – credit costs/average gross loans for Fitch-rated banks rose to 1.6% in 1H20, from 1% in 2019. We see credit costs exceeding 20% of pre-provision operating profit in 2021, down from 60% in 2020, but a sharper than expected deterioration in loan quality could keep profitability muted for a longer time frame, if economic recovery fails to take place on expected lines.

The bank continues to build extra provision buffers for probable deterioration in credit quality, through use of higher probability weights for worst-case scenarios, management overlay adjustments and use of macroeconomic factor projections published by credible sources for collective impairment modelling. 
As a result, total impairment charges for the quarter increased by 65% to record Rs. 553.52 million, compared to Rs. 335.64 million during the same period a year ago. Meanwhile, the bank’s total impairment buffer on advance book increased by Rs. 1.08 billion, or by 17% during the nine-month period. 
The bank’s growth in both profit-before-income tax and profit for the period was also supported by the low financial services taxes regime that prevailed throughout the current quarter. Meanwhile, the bank continued to compute income tax and deferred tax liabilities at the rate of 28% as the proposed new rate of 24% is yet to be legislated. 
The bank’s net interest margins improved from 4.36% to 4.42% during past nine months, which is a commendable feat given the income loss due to loan moratorium, the industry wide deterioration in credit quality and steps taken by the Government to bring down market interest rates. Meanwhile, the bank’s pre-tax Return on Assets remained intact at 1.51% in 2020. 
Further, the Bank maintained a healthy Return on Equity of 11.95% during the period under review, after taking a sizeable hit due to increased prudential impairment provisioning, income loss due to loan moratorium and a waiver of fees and charges.
The bank strived for revenue optimisation through portfolio re-alignment and cost management, despite sector vulnerabilities that prevailed during 2020. The bank’s cost-to-income ratio improved from 52% to 48% during the period under review owing to the excellent core banking performance which reflected in the noteworthy growth in net interest income and measures taken to contain overhead costs. In fact, the bank managed to bring down total operating expenses in absolute terms during 2020 compared to last year.  
The bank’s total asset base stood at Rs. 173.13 billion as at 30 September after posting a growth of over 13% supported by the expansion in gross loans and advances and other financial instruments at amortised cost. Meanwhile, the Bank’s gross loans and advances book recorded a strong growth of over 9% to reach Rs. 121 billion. Term loans continued to drive the bank’s loan quantum growth of over Rs. 12.5 billion during nine-month period. 
Customer deposits recorded a commendable growth of over 12% to reach Rs. 137.60 billion. The bank’s CASA base grew by Rs. 11.88 billion phenomenally during the period, improving the CASA ratio by over 650 basis points (bps). The bank’s gross non-performing loan ratio slipped marginally from 6.31% to 6.38% during the period under review, while net non-performing loan ratio improved from 2.82% to 2.20% due to prudential provisioning.
The bank maintains all capital and liquidity ratios well above the regulatory minimums. The bank’s total capital adequacy ratio improved from 14.31% to 15.11% during the period under review. Meanwhile, both Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and Tier 1 ratio as at 30 September remained at 12.82%. The bank’s Statutory Liquid Asset Ratios (SLAR) at the quarter end stood at 29.65% and 38.73% for Domestic Banking Unit and Off Shore Banking Unit respectively. This is against the statutory minimums of 20%.
Meanwhile, the bank’s Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR) under BASEL III stood above statutory minimum of 90% at the quarter end. The bank maintained LCR ratios of 205.07% and 173.84% for all currencies and LKR respectively.

By Global Finance World’s Best Digital Bank Awards 2020







Group CEO Dimantha Seneviratne 

 




NDB was recently crowned as the Best Consumer Digital Bank Sri Lanka 2020 under the Global Finance World’s Best Digital Bank Awards 2020 program, emphasising the success of the Bank’s accelerated digital transformation.
NDB was the only Sri Lankan domestic bank to win an award at this program for the second consecutive year, and joined reputed regional peers such as DBS Singapore, Citibank, Standard Chartered, Maybank Indonesia and Ping An Bank China as other winners.  
This is the 21st year Global Finance has named the World’s Best Digital Banks.
Winning banks were selected based on the following criteria: strength of strategy for attracting and servicing digital customers, success in getting clients to use digital offerings, growth of digital customers, breadth of product offerings, evidence of tangible benefits gained from digital initiatives, and web/mobile site design and functionality.
“This year, a global pandemic accelerated the transition to digital banking, but forward-thinking banks were already on that road,” said Joseph D. Giarraputo, publisher and editorial director of Global Finance in a press release. “The Digital Bank Awards hone in on the institutions that are leading the shift toward a new world of banking.”
Digital Banking in Sri Lanka has become increasingly competitive over the years with banks implementing new technology and digital savvy offerings for consumers. In spite of such competition, NDB has made is a point to stand out once again at the forefront of digitalisation. 
The launch of the Bank’s NDB NEOS Mobile Banking application – known as the NEOS App Powered by NDB, was the fore runner which enabled the Bank to launch the NDB NEOS Online Banking platform in April 2020, during the peak of Sri Lanka’s COVID-19 crisis. The NDB NEOS Online Banking has garnered popularity nation-wide as a state-of-the-art digital banking platform, with absolute connectivity to all of NDB’s banking services especially during the lockdown period. 
Because new users can easily register using their existing account or card details and continue accessing both channels simultaneously with the same credentials, NDB customers found the NDB NEOS platforms convenient, hassle free and safe. Customers were able to schedule transactions, make bill payments and fund transfers, receive instant notifications, manage their entire financial portfolio, control their credit card payments and have control over all NDB cards, as well as to make direct inquiries and requests. 
Meanwhile, during such a time where minimum contact with others is in the best interests of every individual, NDB introduced NEOS Pay, a QR payment method in which customers can make payments to merchants, pay bills and make a host of other transactions via the same platform.
This QR payment method will allow the customer to avoid using cash, and instead, make payments or pay bills via their NEOS App – powered by NDB, from their NDB Bank account or their other bank accounts registered with NEOS. The user does not need to have an account at NDB to use this facility, as NEOS Pay delivers a one stop payment app for all bank customers. 
Customers can now use multiple platforms within the NEOS App (QR/Just pay/Bill payments/CEFTS).
We have witnessed an environment where everything has seen a paradigm shift, changing the way a customer banks, how brands are perceived, etc. By following a clear strategy for Digital Banking innovations NDB has set the wheels in motion to make the want of becoming Sri Lanka’s best Digital Banking provider a reality taking the entire banking foundation on to a new equilibrium.
The Bank, which is the fourth largest listed bank in Sri Lanka, is one of the fastest growing banks, having had a cumulative average growth rate (CAGR) in advances by 21% and in deposits by 25% in the last four years. The only financial service conglomerate in Sri Lanka, NDB Group is uniquely positioned towards assisting the growth and development of the Sri Lankan capital market to provide its customers seamless access to the product and service offerings of all its group companies.

K Seeds Investments has identified Central Finance Company PLC as the best performing finance company under the 1st category among the 31 listed finance companies in Sri Lanka through a ranking carried out based on their financial performance for the second quarter of 2020/21.
The report segregates the finance companies based on the size of their asset base, and ranks them in their respective categories among their peers based on ten financial metrics, which are calculated from the published quarterly financial statements. Central Finance Company PLC topped the overall spectrum by belonging to “Category 1” (asset base > Rs 100 billion). The Categories 2, 3 and 4 represent the companies having an asset base between Rs. 50-100 billion, 20-50 billion and less than 20 billion respectively.
The unfavourable macro-economic and market conditions caused by COVID-19 for the quarter under review from 1 July to 30 September created a significant impact on the financial health and status of finance companies as they have a significant exposure to higher risk individuals and institutions as compared to licensed commercial banks. However, despite all these factors Central Finance Company PLC topped the category 1 for 2Q 2020. The report ranks the finance companies according to their financial results released through interim reports on the Colombo Stock Exchange across 10 key performance indicators (KPIs) – cost/income ratio, return on equity, return on assets, net profit margin, net interest margin, impairment to loan book, credit to deposits, operating leverage, net profit growth and loan growth. These 10 KPIs are weighted equally, and an overall ranking is arrived at based on the aggregate score for each category.
K Seeds Investments is a boutique investment banking firm, specialising in mergers and acquisitions, balance sheet structuring, equity/debt placements, treasury management, corporate restructuring and talent management.

Reuters: HSBC Holdings PLC is considering a complete exit from retail banking in the United States after narrowing the options for how to improve performance at its struggling North America business, the Financial Times reported on Saturday.
The bank’s senior management aims to present the plan to the board in the coming weeks, the FT reported, citing people familiar with the situation.
HSBC declined to comment on the report.

The bank also said it would also accelerate the transformation of its US business, where it has long struggled to compete with much bigger players.

Nevertheless, we consistently remain a step ahead of such external challenges by adopting prudent practices, anticipating customer needs and seeking opportunities to maintain sustainable competitive advantage,” Vallibel Group Chairman Dhammika Perera said.

Enables instant settlement via mobile phone apps from the safety of cardholders’ homes


The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has become the first bank in Sri Lanka to enable Its Credit Card holders to conveniently and instantly settle their credit card outstanding by scanning a QR code appearing on their monthly credit card statements. 
The bank has announced it is now printing a unique QR code on each statement which can be scanned through the ComBank Q+ app, Sri Lanka’s first QR based payment app under LANKAQR, the ComBank Flash app, any other QR payment app that supports LANKAQR standards, or any application that supports the Mastercard QR or Visa QR apps. 
This development eliminates the need for cardholders to enter their credit card details during the payment process, making it more convenient, the bank said. Customers are only required to cross check whether the six-digit credit card account number that appears once they scan the QR code on the statement is accurate.
While any amount equal to or greater than the minimum payment amount can be entered and settled, customers can also pay their total outstanding bill in this manner, the bank said. This feature enables customers to pay their dues from the safety of wherever they are without having to visit a bank branch.
Commercial Bank credit card holders can avail of this facility at no extra cost and will be notified of their payments instantly via SMS or email. 
The bank said this initiative supports the Central Bank’s ‘Ratapuraama LANKAQR’ program launched recently to introduce LANKAQR as the way forward for mobile phone and digital payments countrywide.
Notably, Commercial Bank was also the first bank in the country to enable QR code payments to settle credit card dues by scanning a QR code appearing on the Commercial Bank website.

Lakshman (centre), at the launch of digital payment solution National Lanka QR Initiative held at Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka’s most innovative bank, HNB PLC, announced that it had successfully linked its increasingly popular digital payment app, SOLO, with the newly launched Lanka QR standard.
Working in unison with the entire Sri Lankan banking and financial industry, the launch of Lanka QR is set to accelerate the adoption of QR code payments across the entire country and lay the foundation for the rapid expansion of digital wallets and cashless payments in Sri Lanka. 
“For several years now, HNB has been among those leading the charge on cashless payments in Sri Lanka, leveraging on the rising popularity of our digital wallet, HNB SOLO. With the launch of a common standard for all digital wallets, the Central Bank has cleared the way for merchants of all sizes to revolutionise payments across the nation. 
“This is a remarkable achievement that will create unprecedented opportunity and convenience for SOLO users. We commend CBSL officials for enabling such a paradigm shifting evolution in the payments space, and stand fully geared to support this major paradigm shift in cashless payments in Sri Lanka,” HNB Deputy General Manager – Retail and SME Banking Sanjay Wijemanne stated.
Lanka QR is a common Quick Response (QR) code standard adopted by financial institutions in Sri Lanka to facilitate fast, secure and low-cost digital payments to any merchant, especially small and medium enterprises. 
It enables customers to pay merchants directly from their bank accounts using a Lanka QR compliant mobile payment app. The payment is instantly credited to the merchant’s bank account. The Lanka QR printed sticker is provided free of charge to merchants to display at their place of business by the member institutions of Lanka QR. 
To pay using Lanka QR, a customer has to scan the Lanka QR using mobile payment apps like HNB SOLO. Upon completion, merchants will receive an instant SMS notification, confirming the receipt of payment.
Coming at a time when the need for social distancing has become paramount in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the linking up of HNB SOLO to the common Lanka QR standard is expected to drive rapid adoption of QR-based payments broadly among merchants, and simultaneously expand the user base of HNB SOLO over the coming weeks and months. 
Since its launch in 2019, SOLO has experienced rapid adoption, and the bank has continuously bolstered features, functionality while refining its user interface in order to make QR-based payments intuitive, easy-to-use and versatile. HNB has also provided extensive rewards to its growing user base through cashback offers. Users can also pay utility bills and mobile recharges in addition to a host of other exciting features. 
With 252 customer centres across the country, HNB is one of Sri Lanka’s largest, most technologically innovative banks having won local and global recognition for its efforts to drive forward a new paradigm in digital banking. The bank has continuously won prestigious accolades including being declared Best Retail Bank in Sri Lanka for 2020 by the Asian Banker Magazine for the eleventh occasion in addition to being the highest ranked privately-owned commercial bank in Sri Lanka by the prestigious Banker Magazine Top 1000 global rankings 2020. Locally, HNB claimed seven awards at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards 2019.

Sri Lanka’s first digital banking experience, FriMi powered by Nations Trust Bank, is proud to announce the launch of the revolutionary ‘Round Up Savings’ feature for the first time in Sri Lanka.
Round Up Savings is an innovative new way to save, and FriMi is the first to introduce this concept to Sri Lanka. Through this feature, ‘FriMians’ can save money every time they use FriMi to pay for their purchases.

Round Up Savings can also be paused at any time and FriMi users can choose how much their payments should be rounded up to.
Explaining further about the new feature, FriMi Product Manager Laila Zafir said, “Saving in small amounts is easy, and when you save small amounts frequently, it adds up. This is the idea behind Round Up Savings, which was actually inspired by how the change money usually just collects somewhere when we use cash to pay. That is when we hit upon the idea to create a new and inspiring way to save and earn interest that will appeal to our customers.”
FriMi is a pioneering, fully-fledged digital banking experience, payments platform and lifestyle partner powered by Nations Trust Bank. Sign up is 100% online, instant and open to anyone with a smartphone, a first for Sri Lanka.

Quick turnaround claim settlements










Fairfirst Insurance Chief Strategy Officer Sandeep Gopal




Fairfirst Insurance in collaboration with Oxfam launched a Weather Index Insurance that commits to protect Sri Lanka’s farming community, specifically the spice farmers. Insurance coverages available in
the market at present do not cater to spice farmers, as such this insurance policy by Fairfirst, will be a strong supplement to existing insurance coverages available to Sri Lanka’s farming community. 
Farming has been the hallmark of every human civilisation that has endured history and they are a community who are integrally tied to the success of local communities and the economy. However, with unexpected changes in climate patterns, farmers are left facing numerous challenges in farming as well as in their household finances. They say, water is the source of all life, and a shortage or abundance of rainfall can take a huge toll on the survival and development of any crop.  When facing these impacts, the implementation of an effective solution to overcome the challenges farmers face is crucial. As such, Fairfirst Insurance recently paid out claims to 49 farmers where the rainfall exceeded the threshold defined in the policy. The beauty of this new parametric product is that farmers don’t have to intimate claims by filling up lengthy claim forms, as claims are settled through an automated process which is based on rainfall exceeding certain pre-defined trigger points.
Commenting on the Weather Index Insurance, Fairfirst Insurance Chief Strategy Officer Sandeep Gopal said, “Insurance is a necessity against the unexpected. Although we cannot foresee the unexpected it is more the reason for us to make insurance relevant for each target market. This is the meaning of true service. And for farmers the unexpected is almost certainly an everyday situation as weather patterns keep changing and has become even more unpredictable. Which is why it is our responsibility to support the farmers of our land by providing them an insurance cover that is relevant, affordable and seamless so that they are able to support the community.”
As the name of the cover – Weather Index Insurance – suggests, it is attributed to excess rainfall or drought to activate the policy. With the support of the Meteorological Department of Sri Lanka and Dialog weather stations in the region, Fairfirst was able to obtain data required to process and settle claims of the spice farmers. However, in the long run it is imperative to expand weather stations in the country to revolutionise weather index-based insurance. 
Fairfirst Insurance Ltd., is part of the global Fairfax Group. The Group is a leading property and casualty insurer, reinsurer and investment manager, headquartered in Toronto, Canada. Fairfirst is today among the top general insurance companies of Sri Lanka and is recognised as the only Sri Lankan company amongst the 2020 Top Insurers across Asia-Pacific. Fairfirst serves individuals, businesses and institutions across this beautiful island through a versatile workforce spread across the comprehensive branch network, affinity partners and brokers in Sri Lanka.

2030 SLISB price movement during 2020 (from 1 January to 18 November) – Source: www.bondevalue.com 







CAM Chairman Malaka Bandara



 





CAM Director Dinesh Ambani




New Ceylon Asset Management (CAM) Chairman Malaka Bandara highlighted “this is a rare opportunity to invest in Sri Lanka sovereign bonds at discounted prices” after a Moody’s rating report overreaction to downgrade Sri Lanka to Caa1 in September (Source: Moody’s Investor Service, 28
September). 
However, Moody’s recent report, was positive on Sri Lanka, highlighting strong FDIs expected during 2021. Thereafter, Sri Lanka International Sovereign Bond (SLISB) prices bounced back with strong buying from foreign investors. Analysts expect the SLISB prices to maintain positive momentum with improving economic fundamentals of Sri Lanka. 
The Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund (CDBF) managed by CAM is exclusively invested in Sri Lanka Government Guaranteed Dollar Sovereign bonds and is open to local individual investors who hold a Personal Foreign Currency Account (PFCA), corporate investors with a Business Foreign Currency Account (BFCA) and Foreign Investors. Investors can exit at any time without penalties, and repatriate dollars to the originating bank account. CDBF offers true diversification for a minimum investment of $ 1,000 while an individual SLISB purchase has a minimum trade size of $ 200,000.
Dinesh Ambani, the new Director to join the Board of Directors of CAM, expects new Foreign Direct Investments to Dinesh Ambani following the 2021 Budget announcement this month, while expecting a positive country rating outlook. He emphasised that “local dollar investors should exploit the opportunity available through the Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund”. 
Sri Lanka International Sovereign Bonds (SLISBs) underwent a turbulent October after Sri Lanka was downgraded from B to Caa1 (Stable Outlook) by Moody’s on 28 September. As a result, SLISB prices failed to gain despite the $ 1 billion Sovereign Bond settlement on 4 October demonstrating Sri Lanka’s creditworthiness. 
Moody’s on 26 October published a favourable report on Foreign Direct Investments into Sri Lanka in 2021. The rating agency attributes the development of economic/investment zones by the ports and state-of-the-art development projects in Port City as the main factors for improved FDIs, including a BOI approved $ 24 billion oil refinery investment over five years. Given the geographic location of the island and intra-island connectivity with development in infrastructure, global names are expected to invest in manufacturing facilities in Hambantota Free Trade Zone (FTZ). 
The 2030 SLISB with a par value of $ 100, traded at $ 71.5 on 28 September levels before the rating downgrade by Moody’s but plunged to $ 53.6 on 29 October 2020 after the downgrade. However, the bond prices recovered to $ 62.31 on 18 November levels following the recent publication by Moody’s on Sri Lanka’s FDI.      
The Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund (CDBF), the only dollar denominated Sovereign Bond Fund in Sri Lanka, is managed by Ceylon Asset Management Co Ltd., an associate company of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. CDBF offers a unique opportunity to invest in dollar SLISBs that are traded globally. The fund is licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka and Deutsche Bank AG acts as the Trustee and Custodian of the fund. 
The CDBF reported a performance of 10.33% in USD during 2019. However, the fund performance as at 18 November is -31.09% (YTD), due to several challenges including the unprecedented pandemic shock and country rating downgrade of Sri Lanka from B to Caa1.
The CDBF is now trading at a unit buying price of $ 0.7360 as at 18 November 2020 in comparison to the YTD highest unit buying price of $ 1.0922 reached on 12 February (Source: Ceylon Asset Management). Accordingly, investors are able to take advantage of the discounted SLISB prices via CDBF with improving economic fundamentals of Sri Lanka. The fund size stands at $ 21.84 m as at 18 November, offering a current weighted average Yield-to-Maturity (YTM) of 17.25% in dollar terms as at 18 November.
Past performance is not an indicator of future performance. Yield to Maturity (YTM) is variable and subject to market change, investors are advised to read and understand the contents of the explanatory memorandum on www.ceylonam.com.

Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe and Managing Director S. Renganathan

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has moved to the top of the ‘Business Today Top 30’ ranking of the country’s best-performing companies in 2019-20, leading a veritable pantheon of the who’s who of corporate Sri Lanka.
Commercial Bank’s return to the No. 1 position in this prestigious ranking follows 12 consecutive years of being ranked among the top five, most of them as the second placed corporate entity.
Business Today assigned Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC total score of 27.6 on a scorecard that ranged from 4.4 for the 30th ranked company to 26.95 for the company placed second on this latest edition of the ranking, released in November 2020.
“We are naturally elated to be back at the top of the Business Today ranking in a year that threw up a fair share of challenges, even before the start of the global pandemic,” Commercial Bank Managing Director S. Renganathan said. 
“Adversity is the best test of corporate mettle, and we dedicate this achievement to the entire Commercial Bank team, which continues to rise to unprecedented challenges this year, as the impact of the pandemic makes itself felt.”
Commenting on the ranking, Business Today said: “Business Today TOP 30 2019-2020 sees movements in the ranking with seasoned players securing a position in the ranking as well as the entrance of companies for the first time into the list. In a challenging environment such as today, it is indeed encouraging to see new players making their mark in the corporate world.”
The magazine said Commercial Bank of Ceylon has continuously been in the Business Today top corporate ranking at various positions over the years maintaining its consistency in performance as the largest private sector bank in Sri Lanka. 
“The strength, aptitude and experience of Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe and the astute and forward-thinking leadership of CEO S. Renganathan have driven Commercial Bank of Ceylon to greater heights with considerable growth,” it said.
The Business Today TOP 30 is based on published information of companies listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and social considerations. The companies have been selected on the basis of their performance recorded during the financial year ending 31 December 2019 and 31 March 2020 with the assistance of KPMG Sri Lanka.
Financial criteria considered for the ranking include share turnover, revenue, profit after tax, return on equity, Earnings per Share, market capitalisation and value addition. Weights are assigned to the criteria uniformly to arrive at the scores on which the order in which companies are ranked is decided.
Ranked Sri Lanka’s Strongest Bank Brand in 2020 by Brand Finance, Commercial Bank of Ceylon ended 2019 with total assets of Rs. 1.4 trillion, gross income of Rs. 150 billion, net profit of Rs. 17.4 billion, a deposits base of Rs. 1.07 trillion and net loans and receivables of Rs. 930.7 billion.
At the forefront as a contributor to the national economy for many decades, the Commercial Bank has been a driving force in economic recovery in the post-pandemic period, leading the private banks in granting working capital loans and providing concessions to affected businesses. The bank has grouped 11 different programmes being implemented for affected businesses and individuals under the umbrella of the ‘Arunella’ Financial Support Scheme and extended these relief programmes beyond the mandated debt moratoria.
The first Sri Lankan bank to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World and the only Sri Lankan bank to be so listed for 10 years consecutively, Commercial Bank is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. The bank, which won more than 50 international and local awards in 2019, operates a network of 268 branches and 875 ATMs in Sri Lanka.

Fitch said yesterday the mergers of Sri Lankan finance and leasing company (FLC) subsidiaries with their parent banks would not have an immediate impact on the banks’ ratings.
The agency’s assessment of its rated banks is based on their consolidated credit profiles and already factors in the risks of having subsidiary FLCs. However, the extent of the impact of absorbed FLCs on banks’ business models and their consolidated risk and financial metrics, particularly asset quality and profitability, will be important for the banks’ ratings in the medium term. The proposal was announced in the Government’s Budget speech for 2021.
“We believe banks will be reluctant to absorb their FLCs due to the significant difference between their risk profiles and underwriting practices, leading to elevated challenges in achieving effective management. FLCs typically cater to sub-prime customers, which banks have very little appetite for. However, if the proposed mergers are enforced, we expect the risk appetite of the amalgamated bank to be lower than the simple aggregated risk appetite of the parent and the FLC subsidiary, as the FLC business is unlikely to be a core business line for the parent,” Fitch said. 
The proposal affects five Fitch-rated banks with FLC subsidiaries – Hatton National Bank PLC (AA+(lka)/Negative), which owns HNB Finance Ltd. (AA-(lka)/Negative), Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC (AA+(lka)/Negative), which owns Serendib Finance Ltd. (AA-(lka)/Negative), Sampath Bank PLC (AA-(lka)/Stable), which owns Siyapatha Finance PLC (A(lka)/Stable), Bank of Ceylon (AA+(lka)/Negative), which owns Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka & Finance PLC, and People’s Bank (Sri Lanka) (AA+(lka)/Negative), which owns People’s Leasing & Finance PLC (A+(lka)/Stable). These subsidiaries’ assets account for 0.5%-7.7% of their group assets (median: 3%) and 0.5%-26% of profit before tax (median: 5%).
The Government’s Budget speech, presented on 17 November, reiterated the importance of consolidation in the FLC sector, which has been on the cards since 2014 when the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) announced its ‘Master Plan for the Consolidation of the Financial Sector’. It led to several banks acquiring FLC subsidiaries in 2014 and 2015, including the acquisition of HNB Finance (then Prime Grameen Micro Finance Ltd.) by Hatton National Bank and Serendib Finance (then Indra Finance Ltd.) by Commercial Bank of Ceylon.
Fitch thinks consolidation in the Sri Lankan FLC sector is positive for its long-term stability, but will not necessarily ease its near-term challenges. The sector continues to struggle with lack of access to capital, muted income generation and very weak asset quality despite the regulatory moratoriums for stressed loans. For details, see Sri Lanka Finance and Leasing Dashboard: FY20, published 19 October 2020.
These headwinds and the fragmentation within the FLC sector at the lower end – where 33 FLCs, out of the total 44, accounted for only around 31% of sector assets – have posed challenges to Sri Lankan financial-sector stability, despite the sector’s moderate 8% share of financial-sector assets at end-2019. The CBSL has taken regulatory action against several FLCs that failed to meet capital requirements, including cancellation of licences held by The Finance Company PLC and suspension of the business activities of ETI Finance Ltd. and Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC.
“We expect significant increase in M&A activity within the FLC sector in next 12-24 months, even among standalone small FLCs, as there are at least 20 that are currently facing capital challenges, either on an absolute basis or to meet the regulatory capital ratios,” Fitch said. Several FLCs have already announced potential mergers, including Abans Finance PLC (BB+(lka)), which is on Rating Watch Evolving to reflect its potential amalgamation with Softlogic Finance PLC.

The Continuous Professional Development Committee of the Association of Professional Bankers Sri Lanka in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group held an inspiring banking symposium on ‘Digital Transformation –End to End Digitalisation of Banking Products’. The virtual webinar, held on 14 October # aimed at discussing and answering pressing questions.
How can banks undergo holistic transformation to stay competitive, be efficient, and drive growth?
How should they cater to the digital demands of consumers in the age of increased internet penetration and smartphone usage?
What can be the potential impact of replacing physical customer experience with digital on the bank’s overall business?
 

Digital interactions across industries are slowly becoming ubiquitous as customers increasingly leverage digital channels to meet their myriad needs. The current pandemic has further underscored the relevance of digitisation and revealed the significant opportunity that it presents to the banking sector. As highlighted by BCG Managing Director and Senior Partner Ruchin Goyal, “The Asian financial services market has witnessed severe disruption over the last decade as firms, both within and outside the financial services sector, launched digital products for the banking customer”. For example, in India, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was launched to facilitate digital payments. 
The initiative has met with great success with nearly 30% of all payments made in India last year being done through UPI. However, it is interesting to note that nearly 90% of these payments were originated by technology giants like Google pay, Phone Pe, etc., and not Indian banks. Similarly, in China, the digitisation journey started with the e-commerce giant Alipay which has now ventured into payments, lending, insurance, and wealth management to become a full-fledged mobile bank. 
 

In doing so, it has not only expanded the market size for digital payments in the county but has also taken away market share from traditional banks. In Indonesia, a company named OVO, which started its journey with digital payments and has now entered lending, insurance, and other banking products is disrupting the market. To put its success into perspective, “it has managed 100 million downloads in a country with a 250 million population”. Innovation is happening around the world and Sri Lanka too is ripe for digital disruption whether it be in terms of mobile penetration, internet users or active debit cards. The question is whether this disruption will be led by banks or will it be other players that will come in and disrupt the market.
Banking has metamorphosed over the last decade and is unlikely to remain the same as we move forward. The pandemic has only accelerated a change that was already underway. For the future, banks need to focus on bold transformations that would require a focus on end-to-end customer journeys. They will need to think front to back end, eschew implementing digital solutions in silos, and adopt agile ways of working. 
 

According to Ruchin, this would entail, “People across functions coming together to proactively adopt and implement digital solutions.” If done judiciously, digitization could accrue several benefits (Refer Exhibit 1) to banks ranging from superior customer experience and increased profitability to growing the market size. 
Digital transformation entails three key modules. These include i) customer journey digitisation, ii) digital underwriting, and iii) personalisation (Refer Exhibit 2). Underlying these three modules is robust data analytics. Banks have access to a humungous amount of transactional data that tells them about the nuanced requirements of their customers. “By optimally leveraging data, banks can better understand their customers and offer personalised services and solutions, enhance underwriting decisions, and improve fraud detection,” believes Ruchin. Further, digitisation needs to be supported by robust technology infrastructure, a good vendor ecosystem, a digital centre of excellence, and a strong governance process. 
Considering the changes happening around us, inevitably, the Sri Lankan banking industry has already embarked upon its digital transformation journey. Highlighting the evolution of Sri Lanka’s banking industry Hatton National Bank PLC Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles shares, “From the basic systems of the 1980s to the advent of online banking introduced by foreign banks to LankaPay today, Sri Lanka’s banking sector has taken significant strides towards digitisation”. 
He further adds, “In an attempt to automate and digitise the banking industry, the Sri Lankan central bank formed LankaPay which has introduced several digital interventions including JustPay, an online payment platform.” Since then, banks have started launching their apps focused on payments and wallets to provide seamless customer experience such as the HNB SOLO app. Further, mobile companies like Dialog and Mobitel have introduced Easy Cash and m-Cash to enable digital payments. This has transformed the payments industry. 
The central bank has been seen leading banks across multiple digital interventions ranging from fintech to blockchain. It has created an environment for fintech to enter, display their abilities on open banking, APIs, etc. and provide plug and play solutions to banks. Many more interventions and initiatives will be spearheaded by the central bank to create a digital payments ecosystem to make Sri Lanka a ‘less-cash’ economy. However, it is important that the digitisation journey of the banks is holistic and not siloed in nature. 
According to Jonathan Alles, “It is important to focus on end-to-end digital transformation as opposed to simply focusing on digital channels and digital products. Banks should aim to offer a holistic and seamless experience to customers.” With the onset of COVID-19, customers and merchants are increasingly moving to digital channels of communication. Banks need to ensure that customers continue digital banking and progress further towards end-to-end digitisation.
When it comes to digitising banking journeys, there is an opportunity to transform not just retail banking but also corporate banking. According to BCG Managing Director and Partner Prateek Roongta, “Banks around the world are now focusing on digitising the experience of their corporate customers and digitising their offerings.” (Refer Exhibit 3)
Digitisation of a corporate bank offers multiple benefits. Firstly, it can help grow the lending book and have a positive impact on deposits. “We have seen examples where digitisation increased the revenue of a corporate bank by 10-30% as compared to a legacy corporate bank,” shares Prateek. Secondly, digitisation brings efficiency in operations and improves employee throughput, thereby reducing costs by as much as 20-40%. Historically, most corporate banks have relied on lending products to increase growth. 
However, through digitisation, banks will be able to diversify their earnings by increasing emphasis on fee income and transaction banking products. “In our experience, a digital corporate bank has 20 to 30% higher fee income than a legacy corporate bank,” adds Prateek. Thirdly, banks can leverage data analytics to better predict defaults in their loan portfolio which can help them better provide for loan losses and in some cases, even reduce them. Fourthly, digitisation can help banks reduce costs and improve productivity. Cumulatively, this will lead to higher customer satisfaction, business growth, and improved profitability. Sri Lanka’s corporate banking digital transformation rests on five main pillars. 
These include:
Empower relationship managers with relevant digital tools to better serve the customers.
Create dynamic pricing tools which can offer customised price proposals to corporate clients based on the nature and depth of the relationship and the type of product.
Build integrated digital customer platforms to address the disjointed customer experience for corporate clients and make their interactions seamless.
Re-design customer journeys to offer a faster turnaround time and better customer experience.
Build a robust digital technology architecture.
Inarguably, digitisation of the banking sector is the future. Not only are the needs of the existing customer base changing but also the customers are changing with the millennials and the Generation Z now vying for financial services. However, in their rush to adopt digital solutions, banks should ensure that the measures they take are relevant and value accretive. According to Seylan Bank PLC Senior Deputy General Manager Ramesh Jayasekara, “There are three key elements to ensure a successful digital transformation.”
Digital transformation needs to be holistic with digital becoming a part of the DNA of the organisation. This can be enabled by a top-down approach and a deliberate digital strategy at the top incorporating all aspects such as budgets and recruitment.
Digital transformation needs to be end-to-end and should ideally cut across all departments in the bank from front to back.
Performance measurement is imperative. It is important to create a digital P&L to understand the success of digital strategies and ascertain tangible outcomes. 
“Digital transformation needs to focus on two important areas: customers and internal processes,” believes Ramesh Jayasekara. “Banks can leverage the massive data available to them to create customised solutions, cross-sell, up-sell, and elevate customer engagement,” he adds. Further, internal processes need to be digitised and optimised by adopting Robotic Process Automation (RPA). This can help banks identify and ease bottlenecks, thereby reducing the turnaround time. 
Digital transformation offers banks a tremendous opportunity to create value for their customers and cater to their changing needs. If done right, it can potentially disrupt the sector while bringing more customers under the purview of banking and banking services.

Foreign holding in rupee bonds remain mostly unchanged
Money market liquidity hits 8-week high 
Rupee continues to depreciate


By Wealth Trust Securities

The secondary bond market yields increased further during the week ending 20 November, continuing the upward momentum witnessed over the previous week. 
The persistent reduction in demand at the weekly Treasury bill auction which went undersubscribed for a fourth consecutive week coupled with the prevailing dull sentiment in the market were seen as the reasons that led to the upward momentum.
Yields of the liquid maturities of 15.12.22, 15.12.23, 15.09.24, 15.08.27 and 01.07.28 increased to weekly highs of 5.87%, 6.10%, 6.43%, 7.12% and 7.22% respectively against its previous weeks closing level of 5.70/75, 6.05/10, 6.27/33, 7.02/04 and 7.15/30, admit moderate trades while two-way quotes on the rest of the curve were seen increasing as well to reflect an upward shift of the yield curve.
The short dated maturities of January and February 2021 bills and August and December 2021 bonds traded at levels of 4.62%, 4.72% to 4.75%, 4.84% to 4.85% and 5.04% to 5.05% respectively.
Foreign holding in Rupee bonds remained mostly unchanged recording a meager inflow of Rs. 0.03 million for the week ending 18 November following two consecutive weeks of outflows.
The daily secondary market Treasury bond/bill transacted volumes for the first four trading days of the week averaged Rs. 5.77 billion.  
In money markets, the total outstanding market liquidity in the system increased further for a second consecutive week to record an eight-week high surplus of Rs. 185.47 billion against its previous week’s Rs. 140.06 billion. 
The weighted average rates on overnight call money and repo remained mostly unchanged at 4.54% and 4.61% respectively for the week as the overnight surplus liquidity was seen increasing to Rs. 195.47 billion by Friday. The CBSL’s holding of Government securities increased to Rs. 566.32 billion.

Rupee continues to depreciate
In Forex markets, the USD/LKR rate on spot contacts dipped to an intraweek low of Rs. 185.40 during the week against its previous week’s closing of Rs. 184.70/80 before activity shifted to spot next contracts to close the week at Rs. 185.50/80.

Offers customers higher loan-to-value amounts at lower interest rates
Protects asset value of gold and offers long term loan tenors
Eliminates the worry of fluctuating gold prices


Pan Asia Bank has pioneered yet another innovation in Sri Lanka’s banking industry, with the launch of a superior Gold Loan product in partnership with a reputed global bank.
It is a unique solution to protect the asset value of customers in fluctuating market conditions.
Along with its global banking partner, Pan Asia Bank has devised this new product to take away the risk of asset devaluation due to market fluctuations. Pan Asia Bank understands the customer point of view which is why it is offering this unique product proposition for the first time ever in Sri Lanka.
Gold loans have traditionally been a preferred mode of accessing loans by a wide swathe of customers but the volatility in gold prices in recent years has made this a risky proposition for both borrowers and lenders. Pan Asia Bank’s new proposition stabilises uncertainty in gold prices, enabling the Bank to offer a higher value to customers whilst also protecting the asset value of their gold. With this unique Gold Loan product, Pan Asia Bank synergises its decades-long experience in the industry and in-depth knowledge of consumers with the expertise of the leading global bank for a product that has been absent in the market, thereby effectively rendering gold loans a safe haven product.
Pan Asia Bank’s new gold loan is the first such product in the history of Sri Lanka’s banking sector. This innovative solution is also in line with the regulator’s vision to see local banks using more derivative options.
Pan Asia Bank Deputy General Manager (Head of Treasury) Richie Dias said: “Introduced in Sri Lanka for the very first time, our new product offers key benefits for our gold loan customers. Very often this mode of financing is used by consumers and the SME sector to fulfil urgent financing requirements, purchase equipment or seed capital, and our new product allows them to borrow more against their existing gold holding than before and not be forced to sell their gold assets to get more liquidity, thereby making a vital contribution to the national economy. Increasing the Loan-to-Value (LTV) on gold loans from the current 75% will be a huge relief to these customer segments who have been struggling to secure loans in the current lending market scenario.”
“Pan Asia Bank’s new product allows our customers to obtain a much higher loan amount for a longer tenor, in line with their business cycle due to the fact that we along with our global banking partner are managing the risk with our joint expertise. As a result, soaring gold prices unlock huge value for idle gold lying with families that can now raise a higher loan amount to meet short term financial constraints,” he added.
One of the key reasons why Pan Asia Bank launched this new product is to support gold loan customers. The new solution clearly differentiates its product from the rest of the industry such that any volatility in global gold prices will not affect the customer or the bank.
This new product also ushers in greater stability for Pan Asia Bank.
In the pre-gold crisis era prior to 2013, the total gold loan portfolio of licensed commercial banks was approximately close to Rs. 500 billion accounted for 25% of the total lending portfolio of licensed commercial banks. With the massive slide in gold prices in 2013, licensed commercial banks had to absorb massive write downs in the absence of a mechanism to hedge the downside price risk. Gold loan portfolios held by commercial banks shrunk considerably consequent to this gold price debacle. In order to mitigate this price risk, gold loans were thereafter granted for very shorter periods than the typical one-year period. Pan Asia Bank’s new solution mitigates all these concerns for banks and facilitates customers to walk in with their gold assets and walk out with cash in no time with minimum procedure.
The need for this product is even more pronounced during the time of a global pandemic and economic stress, empowering customers to leverage their gold assets as collateral to acquire urgent financing.

Facilitates QR reading using SOLO app


Sri Lanka’s largest retail bank, HNB PLC, successfully launched the Stay Safe COVID Tracer solution across its entire branch network and the SOLO app. The solution has been introduced by the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka to help contain the spread of COVID-19.    
As a result, employees and visitors to HNB’s Head Office and entire island-wide branch network will now be able to check-in and check-out by simply scanning a QR code placed prominently at each entrance. This contactless solution will be a convenient alternative to the requirement of writing visitor details in a physical log book.   
Providing added convenience to HNB SOLO users, the bank has also enabled the reading of Stay Safe COVID QR codes using the HNB SOLO mobile app, meaning that the SOLO app can also double as a tool for anyone to download and use as a trusted scanner for Stay Safe QR Codes at any location. Thereafter, when visiting any HNB branch, or any other public location that displays the Stay Safe COVID Tracer QR code, visitors can simply scan the QR code when entering and exiting the premises.  
“HNB is proud to support the vital efforts of the Government in using technology to improve the speed and effectiveness of contact tracing at a national scale. This is an initiative which will be essential in breaking chains of transmission. As a bank with one of the largest retail footprints in the country, we are doing our utmost to help our customers and employees stay safe during the COVID pandemic. This includes rapidly expanding access to digitised services, and taking all possible precautions including stringent social distancing measures. We urge all citizens to also extend their fullest cooperation in this effort, so that together we can defeat this pandemic,” HNB Deputy General Manager Retail and SME Banking Sanjay Wijemanne said.    
“We are grateful to HNB for its quick response in launching the Stay Safe initiative at their entire branch network. Contact Tracing is one of the most essential tools we have at our disposal in bringing the transmission of COVID-19 under control, and so we urge all Sri Lankans, and all organisations that have a high level of public interactions to sign up with Stay Safe, and help us prevent the spread of the virus,” ICTA Chairman Jayantha De Silva stated.
Check-In and Check-Out times will be compared with the times of others who visited the same location. If a person who tested positive for the virus was at the same location at the same given time, institution owners and visitors will be notified by health authorities. Once notified, each individual must then take necessary preventative measures including self-quarantine to avoid the spread of the virus. 
With 252 customer centres across the country, HNB is one of Sri Lanka’s largest, most technologically innovative banks having won local and global recognition for its efforts to drive forward a new paradigm in digital banking. The bank has continuously won prestigious accolades including being declared Best Retail Bank in Sri Lanka for 2020 by the Asian Banker Magazine for the eleventh occasion in addition to being highest ranked privately owned commercial bank in Sri Lanka by the prestigious Banker Magazine Top 1000 global rankings 2020.
Locally, HNB leads the Business Today Top 10 rankings and also claimed seven awards at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards 2019. The first Sri Lankan bank to obtain an international credit rating, HNB is rated on par with the sovereign by Moody’s Investors Service, and the national long term rating of HNB revised upward by two notches to AA+ (lka) recently by Fitch Ratings (Lanka) Ltd.

Abans Finance PLC, a member of the Abans Group, has recorded yet another solid performance during the 1H of FY 20/21 amidst the challenging economic landscape. 
In a statement Abans Finance said the company registered a net profit after tax of Rs. 63.6 million for the 1H of FY 20/21 period ended 31 September 2020, compared to Rs. 27.7 million recorded in the corresponding year, achieving a YoY growth of 130%.
“The performance is attributable to the company’s technology driven recovery and lending practices, which were more resilient during the COVID-19 period, and improved cost efficiencies implemented across the organisation,” the statement added.
Abans Finance PLC granted debt moratoriums to customers for the period commencing from April 2020 to 30 September 2020 to meet the recommended debt relief scheme of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in a bid to support the recovery of the economy. 
While the threat of COVID-19 remains at large in Sri Lanka, the company has taken steps to strengthen its resilience through strategic diversification of the lending portfolio and maintaining a healthy liquidity position. Despite the economic turbulence and the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has re-strategized its activities to be in line to record a higher net profit in 20/21 compared to the previous financial year.
Having a diversified lending portfolio as well as a robust liquidity position aided the performance. Abans Finance PLC had a Risk Weighted Capital Adequacy Ratio above the Central Bank of Sri Lanka requirement, which reflects the stability of the Company. Furthermore, Fitch Rating reaffirmed Abans Finance PLC’s National Long-Term Rating at ‘BB+ (lka)’.
Backing of the parent company further supplements the stability of Abans Finance PLC. Abans Group – as a leading Sri Lankan conglomerate – has an annual net revenue of over Rs. 35 billion. 
Since 1968, Abans Group’s sphere of influence has been growing and far-reaching, extending to every corner of Sri Lanka. More recently, Fitch Rating reaffirmed Abans Group’s National Long-Term Rating at ‘BBB+ (lka)’ reflecting the stability and the stature the Group has earned in the market.

The award was received on behalf of Alliance Finance by Sri Lanka Ambassador-designate in Germany Manori Unambuwe
 


Adopts International Sustainability Standard and Certification Initiative
Embraces high impact goals across organisation
Undertakes Sri Lanka’s biggest tree planting project







Alliance Finance Deputy Chairman and Managing Director Romani de Silva

 
 




Benchmarking sustainable financing in Sri Lanka and the region, Alliance Finance became the first company in South Asia to achieve the prestigious status of being a holistic sustainability certified financial institution by adopting a pioneering global Sustainability Standard and Certification Initiative (SSCI) recently.
The award was received on behalf of Alliance Finance by Ambassador-designate for Sri Lanka to the Federal Republic of Germany Manori Unambuwe, at a ceremony held in Kalsruhe, Germany. It was attended in person and through video link by ambassadors, ministers, central bank governors, CEOs and senior members of the financial community from around the world.
The SSCI is the first global standard for financial institutions encompassing a framework for the holistic integration of social and environmental sustainability, and to drive innovation within the organisational structure ensuring long-term benefits. It enables institutions to create new income streams and opportunities for mobilising funds to finance businesses and projects that create meaningful social and environmental impacts. This certification will ensure that the work and strategies of Alliance Finance are compatible with the Global UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and national development agendas.
As one of Sri Lanka’s oldest finance companies, Alliance Finance has, since 1956, serviced a client portfolio built on trust and integrity with an underlying commitment to sustainable growth and prosperity. The company’s purpose statement, ‘make the world a better place through sustainable financing’ is the mandate with which all corporate activity revolves around, ensuring its management, employees, and all stakeholders fulfil this requirement.
On receiving the certification, Alliance Finance Deputy Chairman and Managing Director Romani de Silva said, “Adopting SSCI has been key to further integrating sustainability into the DNA of our company in its role in becoming a pioneer in sustainable finance in Sri Lanka. Over the decades we see the obvious changes and challenges with regards to our climate, resource scarcity and environmental and social discrepancies that need to be addressed. As a finance company, having the capacity to play the role of a catalyst for sustainable development, we see opportunities this sector can adapt to and help with to bring necessary changes in our economic and business transactions.” 
He added, “This certification further endorses our business philosophy of driving sustainability priorities in a holistic manner while achieving the desired performance goals of the company.”
During the past decade, Alliance Finance has accelerated its sustainability efforts by aligning the business with national development goals and adopting international best practices in sustainability. The company’s corporate strategy was formulated by encompassing sustainable aspects that would enable the business to derive value at every level.
While there are several programs that have been undertaken by Alliance Finance over the years, more recently the company has embarked on ‘one million trees for unity’, one of the largest tree planting projects in the country. “We have already planted 220,000 trees and aim to complete this project by 2023,” he added. Noteworthy here is the cross-involvement of clergy, monks and other religious leaders who have undertaken tree planting in each other’s places of worship as well as school children from across the island, thereby fostering a sense of religious, ethnic and community harmony and engagement.

Environmental and Social Governance
While companies continue to maintain their corporate social responsibility (CSR) footprint to satisfy their principals and stakeholders, more recently there is a call to show interest in actually making significant changes in operational values. Therefore, CSR has morphed into Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) where policies and practices have a more positive impact on the company’s financial performance and long-term business strategies. “There is a call to put your money where your values are,” added de Silva.
ESG standards require the company to screen potential investments by considering the following: Environmental criteria must consider how a company performs as a steward of nature and social yardstick must examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates.
De Silva adds that Alliance Finance, in keeping with the SSCI directives, will pursue aggressively businesses that support the ESG model such as leasing for electric vehicles, organic agriculture, climate smart technology and biodiversity. We need to bring in with equal emphasis the financing of marginalised communities undertaken by the Company at grassroots level. 
“We will actively support clients with their transition to a sustainable economy by integrating environmental and social considerations and actively supporting sustainable business opportunities to grow. Placing this positive impact at the heart of our business strategy is the first step on our road to a greener and more inclusive economy,” he said.
Apart from that, there are several key improvements and activities undertaken by Alliance Finance to further integrate the principles of sustainability through SSCI in to the business, along with required revisions and introducing new policies/practices where necessary. This exercise has ensured that each and every function, policy, procedure and individual role of the employees are well aligned with the company’s purpose and high impact goals that will ultimately lead to desired sustainable value creation. This performance sheet is regularly assessed and revised to ensure all stakeholders contribute consciously towards this goal with performance and measures monitored closely.
Alliance Finance has set down three goals as a forecast for their high impact goals: Goal 1 – to reduce the national carbon footprint of Sri Lanka by 118,000 CO2Mt by 2025, Goal 2 – to improve the living standards of 5% of the households in Northern Province and other rural and marginalised areas through inclusive financial products and services by 2023, and Goal 3 – to develop 75,000 MSME entrepreneurs and self-employment opportunities by 2023.
“These will fall under our sustainably embedded business practices and will encompass our value creation strategy of people, planet and profit,” explained de Silva.
With one of the mandatory objectives of the SSCI being the adoption of FINTECH, Alliance Finance has installed a COVID preparedness plan (formulated in February 2020 and implemented since March 2020) that has transformed high-touch customer service to low-touch possibilities, thereby mitigating unnecessary interactions yet, maintaining customer expectations. “We have adopted a very effective service platform across all of our business including governance, risk management and human resource management,” he averred. 
The company’s HR and stakeholder management processes have been streamlined to align job roles, appraisals and compensations that will contribute towards these high impact goals with significant improvements for continuous learning and the wellbeing of all the employees.
While the management structure has been aligned towards these high impact goals, all products and business transactions have also been optimised and streamlined to better support the operational performances of the company with periodical audits and assessments being undertaken to improve and restructure if and where necessary.
“Ultimately, we want to lead by example and be known for our holistic appraisal of the impacts on economic development, human well-being and our environment,” he concluded.

The architect’s impression of the proposed upgrade of the neonatal facilities at the De Soysa Maternity Hospital

 
 




Standard Chartered Bank recently published its first annual Sustainable Finance Impact Report highlighting the Bank’s unique contribution to tackling climate change, and financing dedicated to achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
The report reveals the Bank’s Sustainable Assets amounting to $ 3.9 billion which includes loans towards renewable energy, healthcare, and education, as well as microfinance and SME lending in low-income countries. It further measures the impact of the Bank’s EUR 500 million Sustainability Bond issuance of July 2019. 
With 91% of Standard Chartered’s total sustainable finance assets located in emerging markets, and 86% in some of the world’s least developed nations, its financing commitment to sustainability in Asia, Africa and the Middle East extends to some of the markets at most risk from climate change and broader environmental, social and governance-related challenges. While these emerging markets face a larger risk from climate change, they also show the most potential to make significant changes by advancing low carbon technology.  
Commenting on the highlights of the report, Standard Chartered Sri Lanka CEO Bingumal Thewarathanthri said, “The Sustainable Finance Impact Report reaffirms our aspirations and efforts towards achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals through tackling the impending climate emergency and other key social issues such as poverty, education and access to clean water. Our global focus is now taking shape in the Sri Lankan context, with the first local initiative being the funding of an EUR 17.9 million loan to the Government of Sri Lanka which will support the upgrade of the existing neonatal facilities at the De Soysa Maternity Hospital in Borella.”
The upgrades at the De Soysa Maternity Hospital constitute the design and construction of a modern building and the installation of upgraded medical equipment, including 40 special incubators for new-borns and training for the medical staff.
Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Head of Financial Institutions Lakshan Goonetilleke commented on the Bank’s commitment to sustainable finance and emerging markets. “The funding of the De Soysa Maternity Hospital is directly aligned to the SDG Goal #3 of good health and well-being, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. We will continue to explore other avenues for financing through which we can continue to enhance Sri Lankan lives by creating a better, cleaner and safer future. Globally, the Bank’s focus on SME lending and microfinance is reflected in its asset base and impact. Over 20,000 SME loans have been provided to emerging markets including India, Kenya, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, with the objective of driving trade and fostering their emerging economies,” he said, highlighting the direction the Bank was taking in alignment to the UNSDGs.
The Bank has made a positive impact on over 1.3 million people in countries such as Nepal, Tanzania and Bangladesh through loans provided to microfinance institutions. The positive impact on the environment include avoiding 738,998 tonnes of CO2 emissions in the past year through the Bank’s green projects, which is the equivalent of 217,000 people’s annual emissions in low- and middle-income countries.

The COVID-19 pandemic has given a second chance to all to revise their business model and way of thinking. Microfinance is no exception
 

By Navindra Liyanaarachchi 

Microfinance and MSMEs
Access to finance is key requirement of businesses. Out of them Micro, Small and Medium scale Enterprises (MSMEs) run their businesses mainly borrowed monies from banks and other financial institutions. 
Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) play important part in providing financial services to these MSMEs where the sector regard as backbone of the local economy. It is roughly estimated that 70% of Sri Lanka’s economy depends on MSMEs and large portion of the population rely on it for their employments and allied livelihoods.
This unprecedented global pandemic severely affects service delivery particularly in the Financial Services sector where MFIs face significant constraints due to their unique operational model and technological limitations. MFIs play a major role in financial inclusion of local economy. Microfinance itself is for people who are unable to access formal financial institutions such as banks and Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs). 
It is obvious that the current pandemic has considerably restricted the services to MSMEs, causing “double impact” in reviving their businesses. There is also a severe impact to MFIs as well, due to lowering recoveries, restricting disbursement and lesser access to capital funding.

MFIs regulation and current issues
Microfinance Act enacted back in 2016 regulates MFIs. Only few MFIs registered under the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) as regulated MFIs. Further NGO-MFIs regulated under NGO Secretariat. Credit Unions (Co-operatives) regulated by Department of Co-operative Development. 
Due to various regulatory structures, MFI regulation is a complex and complicated process. There is no single point of regulating the sector. In most of the cases, credit unions are opted out from the sector but it is important to highlight that there are eight million co-operative members in the country most of them are members of credit unions such as thrift and credit co-operative societies and rural banks. The situation even further complicated due to cooperative subject being devolved into a provincial subject by the 13th Constitutional Amendment.
A large number of MFI companies operate as private or non-listed public companies excluding regulated environment. Therefore, these MFIs are not authorised to mobilise public deposits. In fact, some MFIs use alternative mechanisms to avoid regulatory barriers and mobilise funds from the public as their source of funding which is much easier to access than commercial loans or other funding sources.
Due to the pandemic, restricted interest income of these MFIs is causing problems in smooth operation. As a result, increasing Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) causing profitability of MFIs and depleted cash flows results in lay-offs. It is important to highlight that a significant number of employees rely on these MFIs. 
On the other hand, there are public funds also mobilised as “compulsory deposits/security deposits” from the borrowers. There is a probability of public fund swindles popping up. This leads to further increasing NPLs where borrowers try to avoid repayment even when they are capable of repayment.

Avoiding future catastrophe
It is necessary to maintain healthy and resilient financial sector for any country. It is important to act quickly to avoid collapsing MFIs amid COVID-19. Measures the sector applies now will largely support the sustainability of the MFI business whether it is regulated or not. Further, measures could be adopted focusing towards regulated microfinance environment.
Consolidation of regulatory framework: Current vague regulatory system need to be strengthened. CBSL, NGO Secretariat and Department of Co-operative Development should have a platform that gives clear directions with legal power to act upon non-compliant practitioners.
Public awareness: Public awareness is key in terms of financial literacy of the people about MFIs. Public forums should be organised using social media and other electronic media where people are more towards digital platforms.
Fin-tech solutions: Financial technology is the key across the financial services industry. Banks and NBFIs are more capable of adopting fin-tech solutions with adequate capital and technical expertise. It is very important to have proper systems and procedures through technologies, which will increase service delivery and enable better understanding of the financial position of MFIs. It will reduce the operational cost and will lead to achieving financial self-sufficiency for MFIs.
Availability of funds: MFIs need long-term capital funds as bulk funds to serve marginalised and needy MSMEs. MFIs participatory approaches are convenient to customers and credit plus services are an important part of their business model. If the Government and internal agencies provide low cost funding to MFIs, it could strengthen operations and enable them to provide value added services to their customers.

Safeguarding and improving the MFI business model
Microfinance business are regarded by some as a business of loan sharks. We need to realise the bitter truth that the sector itself should work towards improving its image. There are many MFIs serving quality service to their customers and there is a large portion of MSMEs that rely on MFI services, particularly in the rural context.
Therefore, it is necessary for regulators and practitioners to collaboratively work towards healthy microfinance services. The COVID-19 pandemic has given a second chance to all to revise their business model and way of thinking. Microfinance is no exception.

DFCC Bank Director/CEO Lakshman Silva

 




DFCC Bank, the premier commercial bank in Sri Lanka, reaffirmed its continued excellence as the ‘Bank for Everyone’, by clinching two prestigious accolades at the annual awards ceremony of the Association of Development Financing Institutions in Asia and the Pacific, presented at the 43rd ADFIAP Annual Meeting which was held virtually due to the ongoing pandemic.
In the 2020 edition of the event, DFCC Bank clinched two Merit Accolades under the Outstanding Development Project Awards. The first one was under Category, Human Capital Development, for its project ‘Together We Grow’, as well as another under Category, Corporate Social Responsibility, for its project, ‘Samata English’.
The ADFIAP Awards Program was initiated in 1997 when ADFIAP hosted the ‘Summit on Development Finance’ in Manila, which has since become a permanent ‘fixture’ in the association calendar. The ADFIAP ‘Outstanding Development Project Awards’ recognises and honours member-institutes who have undertaken and/or assisted projects that have created a development impact in their respective countries.
The ‘Samata English’ initiative was a landmark project initiated in 2017 by DFCC Bank, to identify youth in need, and design a program to improve their English language skills to enable them to enter the workforce. The program consisted of practical activities, presentations, skills development and free tutorials in classrooms with modern facilities. Inaugurated in the Gampaha and Kalutara districts as a pilot, the project later extended in 2018 to Kurunegala, Kandy and Galle, while in 2019 saw the project further expand to Jaffna, Polonnaruwa, Rathnapura and Ampara.
Likewise, the ‘Together We Grow’ initiative was an ambitious effort by DFCC Bank, that set out to shift the collective thoughts of employees through the development of a mindset centred on teams, whilst building a ‘never say never’ attitude when faced with bottlenecks and issues that spur up in their daily lives. This vision was driven with the support of volunteers at the Bank, who were committed to creating a positive, productive and pleasant work culture where the staff feel taken care of and appreciated.
Commenting on this recognition, DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva said, “We are delighted about the accolades that DFCC Bank has received, and are grateful for the ADFIAP for recognising two vital projects that we initiated for the betterment of the society and our workforce. DFCC Bank has always been at the forefront of going above and beyond to explore avenues that can create value addition to our stakeholders. The Samata English program has now ensured that a wide array of students enter their desired job markets equipped with enhanced speaking skills and confidence. 
“Similarly, the ‘Together We Grow’ concept promotes development of the highest standard within the DFCC workforce, which inadvertently builds a positive work culture that gives employees the pride to be a part of DFCC Bank. While we thank the jury at ADFIAP again for the recognition of our efforts, I would like to dedicate these awards to the staff of DFCC who work tirelessly to strive for excellence.”

National Savings Bank (NSB) has resumed granting of debt moratorium as recommended by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).
When COVID-19 first appeared in the country during the month of March this year, the Government imposed island wide curfew to control the situation and since many people lost their income due to disruption of businesses or loss of employment under the circumstances, a debt moratorium has been introduced by the Government to extend a helping hand. 
Accordingly, as per the directions and instructions of the CBSL, NSB has also implemented the said debt moratorium under which, the bank has taken measures to cease the recovery of loan instalments relevant for the months of April, May and June 2020 from the salary or pension of all performing retail loan customers. 
As per the subsequent directions and instructions of the CBSL, the bank has continuously granted the debt moratorium, and a great number of loan customers who have joined hands with NSB has been able to reap its benefits. NSB, as a responsible Government Institution and corporate citizen of the country, often strives to fulfil our duty and obligation of the hour by offering a relief for our customers, who are affected by such challenging times.  
With the decision of the Government to extend the repayment period of the loans following the second wave of COVID-19 in the country, NSB has already taken all the required measures to grant this concession further for its customers in compliance with the direction of the CSBL regarding the same.  Accordingly, the application for the debt moratorium is available at the corporate website of the bank, www.nsb.lk and all branches. The customers of the bank can be eligible for the debt moratorium by submitting the duly completed application to the relevant branch on or before 30 November. 
It is expected to ensure the benefit of this debt moratorium for a large number of loan customers of the bank engaged in various sectors, who have lost their income due to the quarantine measures taken to control the spread of COVID-19, such as isolated areas or travel restrictions.

Company shares key insights to transformational change by laying strong foundation for future growth


People’s Merchant Finance PLC (PMF) incorporated in Sri Lanka on 26 January 1983, has been navigating the challenges of Sri Lanka’s banking, finance, and leasing industries for the past 35 years. Dedicated to serving the financial needs of small and medium-sized businesses and individuals across the nation, the Company strives to enrich the lives of more people in more places by providing financial services whenever and wherever the need arose. 
However, this goal has remained heretofore unrealised. In the recent past, the lacklustre performance, the rapid advances in technology, and consistently changing consumer needs which created a need for new ways of doing business increased the inherent challenges faced by the Company. This emphasised a need to renew, revitalise, and reposition PMF to engage on a level playing field with today’s consumers and industry competitors while exploring the heretofore uncharted potential of the Company.

Embarking on new journey to realise true potential  
This new focus by the Company resulted in the search for a strategic right-fit investment partnership to enable PMF to pursue fresh and innovative business prospects and evolve to the next phase of business growth. Accordingly, in May 2019, PMF’s corporate journey achieved a milestone with the arrival of a new major shareholder, Sterling Capital Investments Ltd. (SCIL). SCIL is part of Sterling Japan Co. Ltd., and the largest exporter of Japanese vehicles to Sri Lanka. The Sterling Group subsidiary, Sterling Automobiles Lanka Ltd., operates Sterling Aftercare Guarantee Centres. SCIL is also a perfect strategic fit for PMF’s business model that, to date, has mainly focused on vehicle loans and leases. As of September 2020, PMF’s lending portfolio consisted of 80% of vehicle loans and leases.
With this new partnership, PMF received the required capital base and strong backing to restructure and revitalise the Company’s business goals and processes to pursue innovative and lucrative new business opportunities. The first order of business was to strengthen the Company’s governance and risk management frameworks. To facilitate this imperative, a new Board of Directors consisting of top professionals with strong financial acumen and expertise in various functional fields; were appointed to lead the business to unlock future potential. 
Thereafter, restructuring was directed at securing the right people to lead key business functions of PMF to consolidate operations and remove existing weaknesses. The Company appointed leading professionals with extensive expertise in their chosen fields to lead the Human Resources and Administration, Credit, and Finance functions, and the Recoveries division.
As the next stage, a Chief Risk Officer, a Chief Internal Auditor, and a Compliance Officer were appointed. The Company also reviewed existing processes and put in place more robust risk and governance procedures to meet increasing industry compliance requirements while safeguarding the interests of all our stakeholders.

Renewed strategic direction with the right people in the right place
Having successfully put in place the people required to drive future business growth, the Company focused on improving internal processes and systems and developing new products which would be the basis of improving key performance indicators. Stringent review and monitoring methods were put in place for the diligent performance management of the deposit and loan portfolios. To continue PMF’s promise to offer service excellence, customer-facing activities are being reviewed to offer greater customer convenience. Currently, the Company is developing new and innovative products to meet changing consumer needs and market conditions. PMF is also ready to serve a new target customer base, those who thrive on building domestic businesses to develop local industries and the national economy. The Company plans to release an Entrepreneurial Loan Scheme to support Sri Lanka’s small entrepreneurs with a vision to succeed and grow in the future by mid-2021.  
Furthermore, technology evaluation is nearing completion, and PMF plans to adopt state-of-the-art systems to replace cumbersome and obsolete internal processes with the first implementation by the end of 2020. The advent of COVID-19 in March 2020, also showcased the importance of technology to continue business without interruption, further driving home the importance of incorporating technology to achieve business goals, the next step which the Company will pursue as part of its restructuring actions.

Working on a sustainable performance agenda  
Today, despite the setbacks caused by COVID-19, PMF has realised its goals of performance improvement and customer satisfaction. While much is attributed to PMF’s continued efforts to provide unfailing service excellence to their customers, the Company’s revitalised short, medium, and long-term plans developed in the last year is the key to their success in these difficult times. The steps which were taken to restructure and revive the Company’s business, using modern methods of reaching customers and providing financial services, together with the strong support from the new primary shareholders, SCIL, and the strong management team has borne fruit. Key performance indicators showcase the growth achieved by PMF in the first six months of the current financial year 
(1 April to 30 September -  See box).
The turnaround performance in the second quarter of the current financial year is the culmination of the efforts of the Company’s dedicated employees and revitalised business strategies pursued by the management as directed and guided by the Board of Directors. The focused loan recovery strategies implemented in the short-term enabled PMF to reduce its non-performing loans (NPL) ratio by 9%, while the perseverance of the Company’s employees together with the tireless efforts of the marketing team resulted in an increase in the Company’s gold loan portfolio and total loan portfolio during a time when economic activity has been sluggish, a direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Company is encouraged to see a positive albeit small growth in its deposit portfolio despite the hardships faced by Sri Lankans in the last 7+ months. PMF considers it a show of confidence in PMF’s creditworthiness by customers and other stakeholders to have been able to achieve these successes in such a short period and prevailing circumstances.  

CEO Nalin Wijekoon’s view on team commitment leading to a committed path to new successes
“Our Company has utilised the strategic strengths and synergies of the Sterling Group in establishing a healthy foundation through a solid capital base achieved in FY 2020/21. The exceptional governance framework has enabled us to pursue a pathway of progress towards a record turnaround in earnings growth contributed by significant improvements in the core business model within a short period.
We are embracing the digital sphere by redefining our business processes and challenging the traditional industry boundaries, to stay ahead of the competition and weather the external shocks prevalent in a post-COVID-19 world. We are confident of delivering value to our shareholders while committing to further strengthening our relationships with all stakeholders as we progress in this new journey we have embarked on.”  

Chairman, Chandula Abeywickrema shares his vision for transformational leadership
Commenting on the new transformational journey of PMF in the next five years, Chandula Abeywickrema, the Chairman of PMF and a senior well-respected banker, articulated the number of key initiatives the new Board of Directors have embarked on. He first reflected on the Company’s below-par performance in the past, attributing it to a combination of factors which challenged the Company’s financial performance resulting in a continuously underperforming entity, plodding along on inefficient and ineffective branch operations. Mr Abeywickrema then explained that the new management team began rectifying these issues by placing skilled and professional experts to manage day-to-day business operations. This new corporate management team then brought in greater operational efficiency to the branch network by managing costs and expenditure and effectively utilising the Company’s resources and assets. Decision-making became more streamlined with business expansion decisions being based on what is desirable, what is possible, and what is practical while taking into consideration the evolving market conditions and macroeconomic dynamics of the country.
“We are indeed now very delighted with some of the key changes we have made so far, and the change of direction which we moved on. The mobilisation of the internal and external strengths at our disposal is now beginning to bear results. All financial indications point toward greater and better times ahead for our Company,” the Chairman said. 
In this regard, Abeywickrema attributes the professional approach adopted by the Board, the wealth of expertise and experience, and the wisdom of individual Board members together with the dedicated efforts of the management team in executing key initiatives and engagements at the right time in the right way as the basis of the turnaround experienced by the PMF in the last year. “The Rs. 22.3 million profit earned in the second quarter of the FY2020/21 compared to the consecutive years of underperformance by the Company is also proof of this,” he said.  
The Chairman further commented, “Despite the COVID-19 challenges, PMF will follow through on the revised strategic plan for the next five years, and we will adopt very practical business strategies keeping in mind the challenges that surround our society and the banking and finance industry in today’s economic conditions.”

The journey ahead
PMF is now wholly future-ready. Ready to take on new challenges, ready to thrive on new opportunities, and ready to conquer a new growth phase. Most importantly, the Company is now on a clear and sure path to achieve its goal to enrich the lives of more people in more places by providing financial services whenever and wherever needed. The support given by all stakeholders is invaluable. The confidence placed in the Company by customers ensures future success. The Company has just embarked on this new future, a future which is expected to reinvigorate PMF’s business focus and growth. The Board and Management of PMF look forward to achieving greater heights of success sustained by every small achievement today and tomorrow.

Expanding the frontiers of the National Quick Response (QR) payment scheme, Bank of Ceylon (BOC), ‘Bankers to the Nation’, introduces QR-based Life Insurance premium payments, in partnership with Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC), the largest insurance provider to the nation.
BOC, with an unparalleled history of 81 years, has taken many initiatives to uplift the digital payment landscape of the country. The LANKAQR standard was introduced by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and Lanka Clear (Pvt) Ltd., to strengthen and regulate the QR payment solutions, which will facilitate users to make payments from their own mobile device simply by scanning the LANKAQR code of the merchant or biller. Introduction of a national standard for QR payments has enabled inter-operability between banks, finance companies and e-money wallets with clear operational guidelines given by the CBSL. 
Bringing the revolution to next level, BOC has introduced dynamic LANKAQR-based utility bill payments to popularise the concept of ‘Scan and Pay’, which is simple and convenient for users. It was initially implemented with Sri Lanka Telecom and BOC further widens its scope by affiliating with SLIC to facilitate the national insurers’ valued life insurance policy holders with the ease of paying their insurance premiums via dynamic LANKAQR, thus enabling seamless digital payment experience. 
The addition of LANKAQR is another important milestone of SLIC’s digital journey. SLIC has introduced a wide array of digital payment options such as mobile wallet, digital banking and bill settlements through supermarket chains and banks to provide convenient customer experience. The recent introduction of SLIC’s customer mobile app has enabled customers to conveniently interact with SLIC on Life and General Insurance policy details, online payment options, claim details and the Motor Plus loyalty and partner network benefits. The digital technology partnership between the two industry leaders, BOC and SLIC, with the introduction of   LANKAQR will enable the SLIC consumer to enjoy the latest cashless digital payment experience.     
BOC SmartPay mobile QR payment app was introduced as a simple app for merchant QR payments; and has performed beyond expectations, amassing users exceeding 150,000 across the country. The latest version of the SmartPay app will be released soon with enhanced features to offer our valuable clients a new user experience. 
The tides are changing rapidly, with customers embracing digital banking and doing away with traditional banking. BOC thrives on developing synergies with other corporate entities to optimise digital inclusivity and contributing to the national vision of a “digital economy”, empowering the nation in line with initiatives and directions of the CBSL.

Deposits and assets grow by 12% and 10% 







Amana Bank Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer

 




Amana Bank, through its resilient core banking performance, recorded a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 389 million and a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 250 million for the nine months ending 30 September. In comparison to the previous quarter which was impacted by the first wave of the pandemic, Amãna Bank has been able to bounce back by virtually doubling its profits in Q3, where PBT grew to Rs. 139 million from Rs. 70 million recorded in Q2 while PAT in Q3 went up to Rs. 80 million from Rs. 41 million in Q2. 
Demonstrating strength, stability and resilience the bank continued to maintain a strong momentum in customer deposits during the nine months closing with a portfolio of Rs. 80 billion reflecting a growth of 12% whilst also improving its CASA ratio to 43% which is one of the highest CASA ratios in the industry. The bank’s total assets stood at Rs. 95 billion, 10% higher than the 2019 closing figure. As a result of conscious strengthening of credit risk parameters in the backdrop of challenging market conditions, advances grew modestly by 3% to close at Rs. 60 billion. 
The bank continued to maintain a healthy asset portfolio with non performing ratios being well below industry averages where Net NPA and Gross NPA closed at 1.7% and 4.1% respectively. The bank’s Q3 2020 comprehensive income grew to Rs. 191 million recording a 37% increase against the Q3 2019 performance of Rs. 140 million.
During the quarter the bank continued its annual dividend journey by declaring its third consecutive dividend, which was in the form of a scrip dividend this year. This increased the bank’s number of shares to 2.6 billion resulting in the bank’s Net Asset Value standing at Rs. 4.70 per share. Strengthening the bank’s position as a growing and stable franchise, Fitch Ratings Sri Lanka in its October 2020 review affirmed the bank’s National Long Term Rating at BB+(lka) with a Stable Outlook. 
Commenting on the bank’s Q3 financial performance Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer said, “While we are happy to see progress in performance primarily driven by core banking activities, the effects of the pandemic still continues to have an impact across all segments and industries. We are however confident that we can see it through by focusing on embracing the opportunities that emerge within this adversity.”
During the pandemic, in facilitating CBSL’s stimulus to support the economic turnaround, especially focusing on SMEs, Amana Bank set up a dedicated unit to enable the channelling of relief and offering facilities under the Saubagya Scheme. In this process, the bank accommodated over 5,000 relief requests in addition to processing over 180 Saubagya applications and disbursing over Rs. 1.8 billion to SME customers who requested for working capital assistance. 
Amana Bank PLC is a stand-alone institution licensed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange with Jeddah based IsDB Group being the principal shareholder having a 29.97% shareholding of the bank. The IsDB Group is a ‘AAA’ rated (S&P, Moody’s & Fitch) multilateral development financial institution with a membership of 57 countries. Amãna Bank does not have any subsidiaries, associates or affiliated institutions, other than the bank’s flagship CSR project ‘OrphanCare’ Trust which is managed by an independent Board of Trustees consisting of eminent personalities. 
Amidst the economic challenges, the ‘OrphanCare’ continued to benefit over 2,800 orphan children around the country as it paid its fifth disbursement in November.

The Group ended the third quarter with an operating profit before all taxes of Rs. 5.8 b, a marginal 3% drop over last year amidst the unprecedented disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nations Trust Bank recognised the importance of contributing to assisting adversely affected businesses with a view to supporting the revival of the national economy. Towards this cause, the bank allocated Rs. 7 billion of internally generated funds dedicated to extending financial support to key industries, thereby enabling them to recommence their businesses. Further, special payment relief schemes and special repayment plans for existing borrowers were also offered in addition to the Central Bank mandated moratorium schemes by lowering interest rates and charges on identified portfolios.
The bank actively engaged in providing working capital loans under the ‘Saubhagya’ scheme introduced by the Government and took proactive measures to extend necessary assistance to customers across all segments those who required special attention.
However, stressed macro-economic conditions caused a lack of growth in the overall loan book. This coupled with interest concessions granted as explained above and low yields on surplus liquid assets resulted the Net Interest income to drop by 9%. Nevertheless, with effective fund management strategies supported by current and savings account balances growth of 20%, the drop in net interest margin was curtailed to 20 bps. 
In line with reduced business volumes due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the waiver of fees and charges, the fee based income dropped by 18%. Cards income resulted in the highest drop of 26% with the drop in card spend due to changes in customer spending pattern owing to the pandemic. 
The restrictions on non-essential imports and an overall decline in exports caused a 7% drop in the trade fee. However, gains on trading FX increased as a result of FX funding swaps with the depreciation of the rupee during the current period in contrast to the appreciation experienced during the same period last year. 
The bank continued to benefit from the low cost funding swaps compared to the cost of rupee deposits. The bank also benefited with trading profits on its fixed income securities portfolio with the drop in market rates.
In line with constrained operating conditions due to the restriction in movement which also hampered collections to an extent, the non-performing loans ratio of the bank increased to 7.2% compared to 6.2% in December 2019 resulting higher provisions in impairment over last year. The bank also made additional provisions on impairment for identified customer segments on possible cash flow delays based on available information and on relief packages offered in the form of debt moratoriums.
Through various cost saving strategies and initiatives, the operating expenses were curtailed by Rs. 759 m. This is a 10% saving in expenses over last year. Designating cost champions, productivity and efficiency drives along with more focus on some of the large cost pools were the main strategies adopted in achieving these savings. Accordingly, the cost to income ratio as of September 2020 was 45.7%, an improvement from 47.9% reported in 2019.
With the removal of the Debt Repayment Levy (DRL) and Nation Building Tax (NBT) from January 2020 and December 2019 respectively, the Group recorded a profit after tax of Rs. 3.1 b, an improvement of 22% over the previous year.
The financial position of the Group remained strong as its Tier I Capital and Total Capital Adequacy ratios as at 30 September 2020 stood well above the regulatory levels at 12.69% and 16.4% respectively. The Statutory Liquid Asset Ratio (SLAR) for the Domestic Banking Unit and the Off‐Shore Banking Unit was at 35.32% and 24.51% respectively as at the reporting date.
With digital banking and e-commerce being the way forward in the “new normal”, the bank made multiple upgrades to its platforms during the last few months whilst placing digitisation at its core, enabling many customers to stay connected and reach the bank at customers’ convenience ensuring they stay safe in the aftermath of the pandemic.
The bank will also continue to support both the Sri Lankan Government with all the initiatives taken in reviving the economy, and the customers to overcome the current difficulties and survive the pandemic together.
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed the National Long-Term Rating on Nations Trust Bank PLC at 'A(lka)' and the Outlook as Stable on 6 October.
The bank is confident in facing any potential impact that may arise as a result of the current on-going crisis with its strong capital base, healthy liquidity buffers and the robust risk management models that are in place. The bank also keeps abreast of the current developments in the operating environment and seeks opportunities for growth to maximise stakeholder returns.

During the pandemic that has adversely affected the Sri Lankan economy, Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and Finance PLC (MBSL), a subsidiary of the Bank of Ceylon, was at the forefront of providing relief to its clientele and the citizens of Sri Lanka. It is the country’s pioneer merchant bank and has dedicated itself to serving the Sri Lankan public since its inception in 1982 as a financial institution.
In this commitment, the MBSL has provided relief to more than 20,000 of its customers during these trying times. In the recently released third quarter results depicting a loss of Rs. 731 million, the moratorium effect accounts for Rs. 650 million. It was the mandate and wish of the company to extend its fullest support to the business sector and customers to revive their businesses through relief via the moratorium.
Apart from the moratorium effect, the company’s earnings were negatively affected due to the drop in interest income and fee-based income stemming from low credit growth in the second and third quarters. This is mainly due to subdued economic activity during the pandemic period and an increase in credit impairment charges.
These negative effects come at a crucial time, when the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has requested for capital adequacy levels to be maintained. MBSL is aware of and evaluating the best options available, given the current local and global macro-economic scenario. As a subsidiary of the country’s premier bank, Bank of Ceylon, which owns a 74.49% stake in the MBSL, the company is poised to meet the capital adequacy requirement (CAR) by end of the first quarter 2021.
While taking action to meet the CAR, the company has managed its overheads well and has been able to reduce the cost by Rs. 50 million compared to the previous year through stringent cost control. With a strong management team and a long history of working with all sectors of the country fulfilling the financial requirements of the public, MBSL remains well-positioned and will continue to serve the country in the future. 
It banks on the support and loyalty of its stakeholders and clients, and looks forward to a resilient 2021 where more creative and innovative products and services will be introduced to the market that will strengthen both the company and its relationships with all sectors. Through this, MBSL hopes to negate the adverse effects of the pandemic and to contribute to the revival of Sri Lankan businesses and economic activity.

Lanka Realty Investments Executive Director Hisham Jamaldeen 


 





Lynear Wealth Management Managing Director Dr. Naveen Gunawardane


 





NDB Wealth Management Vice President Asset Management Vidhya Jayasekera




As countries and markets develop, investors will start looking at different forms and classes of investments with real returns coming for those looking at the longer-term. This was consensus amongst speakers a special forum organised by CIMA Sri Lanka and the Colombo Stock Exchange last week
 
titled ‘Get the Best Out of the Stock Market’. 
 
Macro impact to market
Speaking during the discussion, Lanka Realty Investments Executive Director Hisham Jamaldeen noted that if a person invested Rs. 1,000 in a fixed deposit 20 years ago, he or she would have earned Rs. 10,283 by now, whereas an investment in equity market would have likely yielded Rs. 21,037 for the same person during the period. “Now this goes to show holding power.” 
Stating there must be a cultural shift moving away from relying primarily on savings, Jamaldeen pointed out 6,000 new accounts had opened up between May and August 2020, which is up 90% from the same period last year. Up to 47% of those accounts are persons between 18 and 30 years of age. 
“As the country matures, we need to start looking in terms of different forms of savings and investments. If you go into a fund for the long-term, even if the macro fundamentals don’t look good, there is opportunity. You need to consider what type of investment you are looking at, whether it is income you are looking at and how much are you looking to buy. You work with a good broker and do your own study; look at how well operating cash cycles are working. I think our market has a significant amount of legs. It’s a small market, but in times of global crises, Sri Lanka has somehow always performed,” Jamaldeen added. 
 
Short-term expectations
Setting the tone and detailing macro trends in the market, NDB Wealth Management Vice President Asset Management Vidhya Jayasekera noted that following the lockdown in Q2, the market was expected to pick up in Q3 and Q4 2020. People’s sentiments had taken an upward swing by July, she said. 
However, with the third COVID wave it’s changing and Google Mobility Trends show drastic drops in October and economic activity is once again slowing down. She added the budget deficit is expected to be about 10% of GDP. The decline is due to dip in revenues, expenditure has come down. “We are not collecting enough taxes, when this happens, we have to borrow,” she said. 
Inflation has been fairly under control; sitting 4% in September on the back of supply chain dynamics being restricted and global oil prices. In terms of credit growth to the Government, year-on-year there is about a 37% growth. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has promoted reduced rates to promote economic growth by facilitating lending, but attractive deposit rates are no longer available to people. 
Foreign holdings of Sri Lankan Government securities have been steadily declining. In 2013 about 12% of government securities were held by foreigners, but now it is only 0.2%. 
“We only give about 2.8% over the dollar, and we have gone through some major downgrades in terms of ratings,” Jayasekera noted. 
“The market saw foreign outflows of retail and high net worth individuals and institutions. Earnings growth this second quarter has dropped about 43% because of the situation. What is the solution? Do you participate despite the sentiments? One-year returns are fairly volatile with a high probability of loss. But this changes over the longer term. On a non-annualised basis our shares have gone up by 1,729%. The power of holding period returns is great. The market has come down over 25%. If you can choose some good companies and weather the storm, the potential for greater returns is much better,” she added. 
 
Reforms will pave way
During the discussion, Lynear Wealth Management Managing Director Dr. Naveen Gunawardane pointed out Sri Lanka at the moment is at the bottom of the interest rate cycle, adding the exchange rate will most likely stay stable the rest of this year. However, foreign debt payments will challenge our position for the next few years, and the country will need some capital coming into its reserves. However, a bounce back is anticipated globally next year, particularly if COVID goes away. 
Jamaldeen concurred with the views expressed by Gunawardane and said interest rates would have to be maintained at current levels until economic activity picks up. He pointed out that external shocks are becoming a new normal for most economies, as such shocks had been rising in pace and frequency over the past five years. One of the main tools to manage such shocks is low interest rates. 
Jamaldeen added that it would be interesting to note how Government tackles reform especially given the debt repayment scenario, and the extent of reform would spell how successful the country would be in terms of macro level indicators. 
 
Fixed assets vs equity
Commenting further on the potential of capital markets, Gunawardane stated that equity outperforms fixed income assets and this had been seen across many markers. As a country’s economy develops, there are structural change in interest rates, and Sri Lanka will go back to middle income and then high-income category, we cannot expect 20% interest rates. That is where equity as a particular asset class becomes interesting, he said. Valuations right now are very attractive, he added. Pointing to the banking sector during the month of May, the last time those valuations were seen was just before the war ended, Gunawardena added. These are once-in-a-while opportunities if investors take a longer-term view. 
In addition, considering inflation at 5.5%, with Fixed Deposit rates at 5% and Treasury Bills at 4.99% we are now effectively flirting with negative real rates. “So, does it make any sense to put money in fixed income at all, it certainly does not make sense to put money into savings accounts,” he opined.
“I think the banking sector is very attractive, with some of the larger banks at 0.4 - 0.5 book value. There is no reason why these banks should be trading at these valuations even with the moratorium in place. Even if one were to assume there will be a pickup in Non-Performing Loans, there is no reason why they should be trading at half or less than half. The other sector to look at on the longer-term is domestic consumption. Consumers are showing a bounce back. But those are sectors need a longer-term view. In January and February, we were looking at an economy which was expanding. We had stimulus given in the form of tax breaks which fuelled consumers. Once the lockdown lifted the economy came back online, but we need to see what happens with the current round,” Gunewardena stated.
 
New instruments and classes
Jamaldeen also pointed to the buoyant consumer market, noting he thinks it’s also a lot to do with grey market imports being restricted. With restrictions mainstream players are immediate beneficiaries. He felt if one were to look at the Sri Lankan market in terms of sectors, banking would be the only one that stands out. He advises investors to look at the longer-term, even sectors like power where effectively it is a long-term contract with the government and one gets a return on payment in 20 years. 
“That for me is effectively a separate asset class, which is effectively a government bond. You are getting a higher rate and that is an opportunity to look at.” It is not just about price, he added, and “don’t look simply at discounts. Good companies will be expensive and the trajectory of where they are going will significantly outweigh a company which is very cheap.”
Commenting on Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), with Sri Lanka just introducing legislation around it, Jamaldeen opined these do not currently look attractive as returns for holders. Sri Lanka presents income yielding property asset class and development assets which includes affordable housing products and industrial parks. 
“Sri Lanka has introduced rules mostly around income yielding products. With the type of return these are producing it is going to be very difficult to attract people to come into that format. Good news is; yes we have REITs but the format is not ready and needs some fine tuning. And there is an issue with Stamp Duty, for when you move assets in and out of a REIT it should be stamp duty free. When you add another 4% the whole equation goes down.
“For a company what REITs could do is it clears your balance sheet. It effectively takes on a property asset and gives a long lease and takes that off the balance sheet. Then suddenly there is more capital. It works well for long-term pension funds, it gives retailers access to real estate in markets, but I don’t see people running down there to set up REITS in its current format,” Jamaldeen averred.

Ministry of finance

As citizens, why do we need to pay taxes? The simple answer is, taxation is the means of collecting revenue for Government spending for the goods and services we need as a populace. However, developing tax policies that are both fair and efficient are far from simple. The difficulties are especially multiplied, being a developing country like Sri Lanka, and having to compete in the world economy. Taxation should raise essential revenue for the Government to function, without depending too heavily on government borrowing. It should also not hinder economic activity in the country or discourage entrepreneurship.
Unfortunately, the fiscal and tax policies adopted in Sri Lanka in the recent past have not been able to achieve any of the ideals of an effective tax system. The picture presented by the Prime Minister in his speech during the second reading of the Appropriation Act, stated that the budget deficit in the country has increased from 5.7% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2014 to over 9.6% of GDP by 2019. The budget deficit has been bridged through non-settlement of dues to suppliers and beneficiaries from whom the Government had procured goods and services, which is unsustainable in the long run. The public debt that stood at 70% of GDP in 2014 has increased to 85% of GDP. The state of affairs currently, paints a very dismal picture about our economy, and it also poses a severe challenge to the incumbent Government to reverse this adverse situation.
This is the reason we are eagerly awaiting the reading of the first Budget of the present Government. It will outline the tax proposals and other fiscal measures that the lawmakers will have to take, to revive and revitalise our economy. It needs to be done amid the added challenges that are being posed by the global pandemic. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently forecasted that almost all countries in the world are under a massive contraction and that all major economies have recorded negative growth rates. [World Economic Outlook – 20 October 2020]. With heavy spending allocated to the health sector, the Government needs to collect revenues not only to finance its spending but also to service the country’s tall debt bill.   
We need to take cognisance of the inherent limitations in our system, when devising efficient tax policies. Firstly, most of our workforce are employed in the agriculture sector or in small, informal enterprises. They are not paid fixed wages and their earnings fluctuate. The base for an income tax is therefore hard to calculate. They will also spend their earnings at small informal stores that do not usually keep accurate records of sales and inventories. Therefore, collecting revenue such as income taxes and consumer taxes become a challenge. 
Secondly, is it difficult to create an efficient tax administration without well trained staff and computerised operations for revenue collection. The Government has made significant investments in improving these areas, but there is still room for improvement. Without a strong tax administration, the Government will be compelled to take the path of least resistance that allows the taxpayers to often exploit the loopholes. 
Thirdly, the income is unevenly distributed among the people. This would mean that high tax revenues should be collected from the rich. However, the tax system in Sri Lanka is such that this does not happen. The policymakers should revisit the personal income taxes and property taxes and devise proposals in these areas to achieve higher tax revenues.
Therefore, tax policy in Sri Lanka is often the art of the possible rather than the pursuit of the optimal. The Government needs to balance the scales between Government spending vs revenue collection in this backdrop when presenting its budget for 2021; ‘Vistas for Prosperity’.
 
Level of tax revenue
First and foremost, the Government needs to decide what level of public spending is sustainable given the level of national income. Here again, it needs to prioritise essential items of spending and rationalise its budgets. When the level of spending has been determined, then the amount of tax that needs to be collected to facilitate that spend can be calculated.
Data shows that the tax level in major industrialised countries is about double the tax level in a representative sample of developing countries. Economic development and growth often generate additional tax revenues to finance an increase in public spending. But at the same time, it increases the country’s ability to collect higher revenues to meet these needs. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the level of tax revenue needed to finance Government spending.
 
Composition of tax revenue
This deals with questions at a policy level as to whether the Government should tax income or tax consumption of the people. Should the Government tax imports or domestic consumption? The central issues that need to be looked at are whether the tax enhances the overall welfare of those who are being taxed and also whether the tax is fair and equitable to everyone.
Taxing consumption has traditionally been thought to be inherently more regressive than taxing income (i.e. it places a higher tax burden on the poor than the rich). When you look at the statistics provided in the Central Bank Annual Report for 2019, tax revenue amounts to 12.6% of GDP, of which only 2.8% has been collected by way of income tax. 5.7% has been collected by way of Value Added Tax and Excise taxes which are both consumption taxes. This reflects the trend in Sri Lanka to tax consumption rather than income.
We saw a significant change in collecting tax revenues with effect from 1 January 2020, where the incumbent Government announced a host of sweeping changes to the tax system in Sri Lanka. The objective of this move was to simplify the tax structure with several taxes like Nation Building tax, Economic Service Charge being scrapped and providing tax concessions, thereby enhancing the disposable income of the people to support the revival of the subdued economic activity. 
Unforeseen at the time of introducing these changes, the COVID-19 pandemic took grip of the country’s economy in March 2020 and according to statistics, tax revenue has dropped by 26% up to April 2020. Therefore, we are unable to say whether the changes implemented in January 2020 had their intended outcome. In certain cases, the reduction in taxes has increased the disposable income in the hands of the taxpayers but with wage cuts, the effects of these benefits have not truly been felt by individuals.
The decision to reduce taxes on imports has two competing evils. Lowering these taxes will lead to more competition from foreign enterprises while reducing the protection for domestic industries. Therefore, balancing the sentiments of the domestic producers and counteracting the benefits for trade liberalisation needs to be carefully analysed.
Data from industrial and developing countries show that compared with developing countries industrial countries derive proportionally twice as much revenue from income tax than from consumption tax. The data also reveal a notable difference in the ratio of corporate income tax to personal income tax. Industrial countries raise about four times as much from personal income tax than from corporate income tax. On the other hand, revenue from trade taxes is significantly higher in developing countries than in industrial countries.
A compelling fact in the comparison is that economic development tends to lead to a relative shift in the composition of revenue from consumption to personal income taxes. While it is difficult to draw a clear policy prescription on the income-consumption tax mix for Sri Lanka, the policy makers need to assess the economic consequences that a shift will have on the efficiency and equity of the tax system in Sri Lanka. 
 
Different tax types
Personal income tax
The contribution from personal income tax vs. corporate income tax is not readily ascertainable as the publicly available statistics have grouped both under income tax. The general understanding is that personal income tax has yielded relatively little revenue and the number of individuals subject to tax is small as some individuals manage to stay below the radar. The Annual Performance report released by the Department of Inland Revenue for the year 2019 has indicated that it has 281,105 files for individuals and 1,149,883 files for Employees paying Income tax under PAYE scheme. This is a very minor fraction of a population of 21 million.
The rate structure on how personal income tax is imposed is the most visible policy instrument to justify the commitment to social justice and equitable nature of taxation by maintaining a progressive rate structure. The progressive nature of this tax however is diluted by exemptions and deductions that benefit people with high income. If we take a few examples, exemptions on capital gain tax, deductions for medical and educational expenses, lower tax rates on interest income, all support high income earners to reduce their tax burden. 
Sri Lanka being a country which provides free healthcare and free education should consider the rationale for these additional deductions. We have seen that in certain cases medical expenses are incurred overseas or on health insurance schemes provided by foreign companies. In these cases, the deduction is allowing for a loss of tax revenue to the Government as well as supporting foreign currency flowing out of the country. Therefore, in order to establish clear progressive tax rates among different income earners, various exemptions and deductions should not be encouraged.
In certain countries, the higher tax slabs applicable on personal income tax is higher than the corporate income tax rates. This provides a strong incentive for individuals to choose to do business through a formal company structure. In Sri Lanka, professionals and small entrepreneurs generally siphon off profits through expense deductions and escape tax at higher rates. Therefore, it is good to encourage businesses to operate through companies, which are regulated under the Companies Act which mandates that the financials need to be audited and other monitoring mechanisms are in place.
 
Value added tax, excise and import tariffs
Value Added Tax (VAT) is a cascading tax where the tax burden is shifted along the supply chain and the tax is borne by the final consumer. It is also the highest revenue generating tax for the Government. The Cabinet of Ministers in December 2019 reduced the VAT rate from 15% to 8% and also increased the VAT registration threshold to Rs. 25 million a month from Rs. 1 million a month. These effectively reduced the cost of goods and services for the end consumer and it also reduced the number of taxpayers coming within the VAT net.
There are several shortcomings in the administration of this tax. Most often taxpayers are denied their tax credits due to system issues with the RAMIS. There are also issues with VAT paid at the point of import and the information provided by the Customs to the Department of Inland Revenue. This again results in the tax credits being denied to the taxpayer. VAT refunds are not processed expeditiously, and the taxpayers have to face severe cash flow issues because of this. Necessary measures to improve the administration of VAT need to be put in place for it to be an effective revenue collection tool for the Government.
The economic rationale for imposing excise taxes is very different from that for imposing a general consumption tax. Excise is highly selective, narrowly targeting a few goods mainly due to the fact that their consumption entails a negative impact on society. The goods deemed to be excisable are few and inelastic in demand. A good excise system should generate revenue from a narrow base with a relatively low administration cost.
Reducing import tariffs will affect domestic industries and its prices. The present Government is encouraging local businesses and also promoting exports of value-added products from Sri Lanka. Therefore, in the present circumstances, it is not likely that there will be a reduction in import tariffs.
 
Tax incentives
Countries around the world, grant tax incentives to promote investment into the country. However, evidence suggests that their effectiveness in attracting incremental investments beyond what would have been reached is questionable. Most foreign investors consider ease of doing business, ease of repatriating the returns, infrastructure available to do business, labour costs and cost of other inputs, political stability, transparent regulatory systems, etc. to be more important than whether there are tax incentives. Therefore, more focus should be given to these other areas in order to attract foreign investments.
Tax incentives can however be justified in a situation where it addresses some form of market drawbacks. For example, tax incentives given to industries that introduce high technology or innovation can be justified on the basis that this will confer significant benefits to the rest of the economy. These incentives however have to be structured in a way that is suited for achieving the objectives set for itself.
 
Tax holidays
Tax holidays are easier to administer but they have numerous shortcomings. Tax holidays tend to benefit an investor who expects high profits and would have any way made the investment even if this tax holiday was not offered. Further, tax holidays provide a strong incentive for tax avoidance, as taxed enterprises enter into economic relationships with exempt enterprises to shift their profits through transfer pricing. 
The duration of the tax holiday is also prone to be abused by re-designating existing investments as new investments. Time bound tax holidays tend to attract short term projects, which are generally not so beneficial to the economy as longer terms projects. Therefore, tax holidays should necessarily be granted to only larger projects with a longer life span. 
The tax authorities should also allocate time and resources to audit these entities to avoid tax evasion and abuse of its benefits, which yields no revenue to the Government. Therefore, tax holidays are not a very effective tool to attract investments.
 
Accelerated depreciation
Providing tax incentives in the form of accelerated depreciation is an effective tool in the hands of the policy makers. Accelerating the depreciation of an asset does not increase the depreciation of the asset beyond its original cost. It is merely a slight distortion done in the short term to reduce the taxable profits. This method is least costly to the Government as the revenue foregone in the early years is at least partially recovered in subsequent years of the asset’s life. Also, if acceleration is made available only temporarily, it could induce a surge in investment in the short run. Therefore, this is an effective method to grant tax incentives to promote investments.
 
Tax credits and investment allowances
Tax credits and investment allowances are better targeted than tax holidays for promoting particular types of investment. Their revenue cost is more transparent and easier to control. A simple and effective way to administer a tax credit system is to determine the amount of credit granted to a qualified enterprise and to recognise this amount in a special tax account notionally. In all other respects the enterprise will be treated as an ordinary taxpayer but the only difference would be that its income tax liabilities would be paid from the credits in the special tax account.  This mechanism allows the tax officers to have all the necessary information at hand, and it is a more transparent way of granting tax incentives to promote investment. A system of investment allowances is also administered in much the same way as tax credits and will achieve similar results. This also can be used by the Government to attract investments into preferred sectors.
 
In summary
Winston Churchill has very eloquently said: “For a nation to tax itself to prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle.” Therefore, the best approach for sustained investment promotion is to provide a stable and transparent legal and regulatory framework and to have a tax system in line with international norms.

AIA Group Ltd. has announced a 22% growth in new business to $ 706 million in the third quarter in comparison to a year earlier.
Annualised new premiums (ANP) grew by 21% to $1,359 million whilst AIA reported a Value of new business (VONB) margin of 51.6%, consistent with the second quarter of 2020. Total weighted premium income (TWPI) was up 7% from the third quarter of 2019
AIA Group Chief Executive and President Lee Yuan Siong said: “The Group has delivered strong sequential growth in the third quarter with VONB up 22% compared to the second quarter, building on the strong momentum as restrictions eased. TWPI grew 7% year-on-year and our in-force business continues to demonstrate resilience with strong persistency.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has been well controlled in many of the markets where AIA operates, following the easing of containment measures. While remote completion continues to account for a significant proportion of new business in some markets, we have generally seen an increase in the proportion of our sales sourced from face-to-face meetings.

“In the third quarter of 2020, the Group delivered strong momentum in new business sales. VONB increased by 22% compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by sequential quarter-on-quarter growth from almost all of our markets. VONB margin was consistent with the second quarter as the reduction from economic assumption changes and geographical mix shifts was offset by reduced acquisition expense overruns as quarterly sales momentum improved. Across our agency businesses, we have continued to build future capacity with new recruits up more than 20% compared to the third quarter of 2019.

“After the sharp contraction in the global economy in the first half of 2020, some countries have returned to growth in the third quarter, including Mainland China. Economic recovery has diverged significantly at the country level, driven by the effectiveness of pandemic containment measures and government policies as well as the importance and competitiveness of manufacturing industries. 
“The medium-term outlook remains highly uncertain given COVID-19 infections have been rising in many countries and political and trade tensions remain elevated. However, the demand for AIA’s products and services will continue to grow over the long term, powered by the structural drivers of rising wealth, low insurance penetration levels and limited social welfare across Asia. AIA is uniquely positioned through our powerful distribution, differentiated propositions, leading brand and financial strength to capture the enormous long-term opportunities in the Asian life and health insurance market.”

Others from left: CBSL Director Payments and Settlements Dharmasri Kumaratunge, DFCC Manager Merchant Acquiring Chrishan Jayamanne and CBSL Assistant Governor R. A.A. Jayalath 

Following the launch of the national LANKAQR initiative – “Rata Puraama LANKAQR” – recently at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), DFCC Bank was amongst the first financial institutions to gain LANKAQR certification. 
This monumental partnership with CBSL to mobilise the “Rata Puraama LANKAQR” project which will support ease of transactions for people in all walks of life is well in line with the corporate strategy of becoming the most customer centric and digitally enabled bank.
DFCC Bank launched its QR based DFCC Pay App in January 2019 and was one of the first banks to be certified for LANKAQR standard, which is now accepted as the national common QR and is used to process smart mobile device-based local currency payments. 
The DFCC Pay App permits customers to make retail payments using smart mobile devices through funds available in their current or savings account to the merchant’s account directly. The DFCC Pay App provides a convenient, secure and affordable option for making retail payments, which is otherwise primarily made by cash. DFCC Credit Cards can also be added to the DFCC Pay App to facilitate Visa QR local and overseas transactions at VISA QR enabled merchant outlets through a smart mobile device.
Similarly, the DFCC Pay Merchant App can be used by all types of merchants in the country from large corporates, SMEs to wayside vendors to accept these payments. DFCC Bank QR Merchants can accept payments even with the use of a basic feature phone as the payment confirmation can be sent as an SMS Alert. 
Showcasing DFCC’s focus on financial inclusion to un-banked and under banked segment in society, a vegetable vendor was recruited to accept payment through LANKAQR using his feature phone at the inaugural launch event that was held at Central Bank’s Regional office in Matale on the 12 September.
In line with the national LANKA QR initiative, DFCC Bank also sponsored the ‘Race the Pearl’ 24 hour bicycle race which commenced from Point Pedro and concluded at Point Dondra on 2 and 3 October. The participants and their families were given the opportunity to donate to the Wheels for Wheels foundation through the use of the QR technology. The Foundation donates wheelchairs to children with Cerebral Palsy and the QR solution was well received by a new segment of users.
Speaking on the inclusion of DFCC Bank as a LANKAQR certified institution, DFCC CEO Lakshman Silva, stated “DFCC gaining LANKAQR certification resonates well with our objective of being a true bank for everyone. When we as a financial institution consider the benefits that this initiative will provide for the people of Sri Lanka, it is clear that LANKAQR will result in more financial inclusion,”
He further went on to note, “As a bank, we too have a responsibility to ensure that our citizens embrace new technologies as we bridge the gap toward a cashless future. The success of our DFCC Pay app which allows for these transactions to take place is also a clear indication that our efforts have paid off. I am confident that this is only the beginning of digital payments in Sri Lanka and as a benchmark Bank in the country, DFCC will be ever-ready to embrace technologies such as these as they roll out,”
Given the numerous benefits to the economy and the public, CBSL together with DFCC and other financial institutions aim to increase the availability of LANKAQR in Sri Lanka to one million merchants by the end of 2020. As a responsible corporate entity that understands the importance of the society in which it operates, DFCC is committed to ensuring that this target is achieved. The Bank will adapt to changes in technology and ensure that the customers are afforded with the opportunity to conveniently, securely and affordably transact using latest innovate technologies.

To enhance security and safety of contactless payments

Mastercard has teamed up with IDEMIA, a global leader in Augmented Identity, and MatchMove, a Singapore-based fintech, on their first pilot in Asia of a biometric card that uses a fingerprint to authorise transactions at in-store payment terminals.
The card, with the product name F.CODE Easy, takes the seamless and intuitive experience of biometric authentication from a smartphone to a smart card. It makes transactions more convenient, safe and secure by eliminating the need for a cardholder to provide a PIN number or signature, thereby reducing touch points in public places.
Developed by IDEMIA in accordance with Mastercard’s technical and design specifications, F.CODE Easy ensures privacy and security by storing all biometric credentials on the card chip rather than a central database. The battery-free card, which harvests energy from payment terminals to power its fingerprint sensor, is designed to be user-friendly and is certified to ISO standards by Mastercard for security and compliance.
MatchMove, a banking as a service provider in Singapore, will issue the biometric cards for the pilot in the fourth quarter of this year. The pilot will feature employees of Mastercard, IDEMIA and MatchMove using the cards for transactions and live demonstrations for customers.
“As people make a permanent move to contactless transactions, the biometric card promises more choice and greater security for consumers,” said Matthew Driver, Executive Vice President, Services, Asia Pacific, Mastercard. “With Mastercard’s focus on digital commerce, this solution is a testament to the innovative partnerships Mastercard cultivates and its mission to provide fast, frictionless payment experiences that are protected at every point.”
The shift to touch-free transactions is underway globally as almost six in 10 consumers say the move to digital payments is likely to last and nearly half plan to use cash less often even after the COVID-19 pandemic passes, according to a Mastercard study in multiple markets around the world published in June. In Asia Pacific, a large majority – 71% in Australia, 77% in India, 73% in China and 62% in Japan – believe the shift to contactless payments is here to stay.
To support the onboarding process for F.CODE Easy, IDEMIA will provide a full set of services to MatchMove that allow users to enrol in their own homes for maximum convenience.
“We are proud to celebrate this milestone on our journey to shaping the future of payments into one powered by biometrics,” said Vincent Mouret, Senior Vice President of Financial Institutions Asia Pacific at IDEMIA. “We are delighted to partner with Mastercard and MatchMove to launch F.CODE Easy in Asia and we look forward to continuing to work together to provide end-to-end security for fintechs.”
MatchMove, which aims to democratise essential financial services using advanced cloud and mobile technologies, is one of 21 applicants for Singapore’s digital banking licenses.
“We are excited to partner with IDEMIA and Mastercard to pioneer cutting-edge solutions that empower our customers to make safe and secure payments,” said Amar Abrol, Chief Commercial Officer at MatchMove. “By leveraging F.CODE Easy, we can enable multiple use cases for our clients who in turn create greater value and utility for their customers, employees, suppliers and partners. We look forward to working together and introducing new innovative solutions to the market.”

HONG KONG (Reuters): Asian share markets mostly rose on Tuesday as global investors applauded successful trial data for a coronavirus vaccine, although expected delays to any mass roll-out took the gloss off early gains.
European futures trading during the Asian session were indicating a weaker open of at least 1.2%, while US futures showed a potential fall of at least 0.5% after Monday’s steep market gains.
The positive tone in Asian equities came after Pfizer Inc said its COVID-19 vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech SE, was more than 90% effective in preventing infection, marking the first successful results from a large-scale clinical trial.
Major Asian markets soared on the vaccine news before weakening later in the session.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 ended up nearly 0.3% after being 1.1% higher in early trading, touching a 29-year high.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 closed 0.66% higher after trading up as much as 1.6%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was at 0.77% in the afternoon after rising 1% in early trade.
Singapore’s Straits Times .STI gained 2.94% to take the index to its highest point since June.
Despite the optimistic tone across the region, there was some weakness in China, with the CSI300 Index slipping 0.17%.
Analysts attributed the decline to the heavy exposure of China’s indices to tech stocks, which came under pressure as investors eyed less consumer reliance on technology if a vaccine leads to an easing of movement restrictions.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.1% higher.
“The market is looking forward to a more sustained solution to the pandemic and that is why we have seen such a sharp reaction,” said Tai Hui, Chief Asia Market Strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.
However, he sounded caution over the speed in which the vaccine could be implemented.
“Given more tests are needed, then the approval process. Manufacturing and distribution would mean the vaccine, if truly effective, is still months away from mass deployment.”
The equities optimism was not shared across all asset classes. Oil prices slipped in Asian trade after posting the biggest one-day percentage gain in five months.
The overnight rise prompted some traders to take profits, analysts said.
Brazil’s health regulator said on Monday it had suspended clinical trials for China’s Sinovac coronavirus vaccine after adverse effects had emerged.
Stocks rotation
Airline, travel and tourism stocks across Asia were beneficiaries of the positive sentiment from the vaccine announcement and held their gains while the broader indices weakened in the afternoon.
“No surprises but it’s essentially a rotation ... what was bought in the last eight months is now being sold and what was sold is being bought,” Citigroup Global Markets Director Elizabeth Tian said.
Qantas Airways closed 8.3% higher to hit its highest level since March, Japan Airlines shot 20.6% higher and ANA Holdings rose 17.5%.
In Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific Airways shares jumped 13%, the best since July.
“Markets will get ahead of themselves in the short term with the vaccine news but longer term it feels like it is going higher,” Ord Minnett Advisor John Milroy said from Sydney.
Early Tuesday, Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga instructed his cabinet to design a fresh stimulus package to help revive the nation’s flagging economy to offset the ongoing effects of coronavirus.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.95%, the S&P 500 gained 1.17% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.53%. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.47%.
While stocks have also rallied on the assumption that Democrat Joe Biden would be the next US President, the top Republican in US Congress on Monday did not acknowledge Biden as president-elect, raising concerns about a rough transition.
The Australian dollar fell 0.08% versus the greenback at $0.7279.
The yen strengthened 0.38% to 104.96 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3182, up 0.14% on the day.
The vaccine news also sent long-dated US Treasury yields sky-rocketing in their biggest one-day jump since March. The yield curve, an indication of risk appetite, hit its steepest level since March.
Bonds had their biggest selloff since recoiling from March peaks. The yield on benchmark 10-year US government debt, which rises when prices fall, jumped 10.3 basis points on Monday and held above 0.9% on Tuesday at 0.9099%.
The CBOE Market Volatility index, a barometer of investor anxiety, hit its lowest closing level since late August.
Oil prices lost momentum in Asian trade. Light crude oil fell by 1.49% to $39.74 a barrel while Brent crude slipped 1.06%.
Spot gold added 1% to $1,880.26 an ounce.

IFC Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives Amena Arif 


AIA Sri Lanka CEO Nikhil Advani 



Sri Lankan women, including female entrepreneurs, are expected to have increased access to insurance and more of a chance of a job in the insurance industry, in the wake of an agreement between IFC, a member of the World Bank Group and AIA Sri Lanka – subsidiary of the life insurance group, AIA Group. 
Under the agreement, IFC will help AIA Sri Lanka develop a women’s insurance program strategy and suitable products for Sri Lankan women. In a country where very few women have insurance, the move will boost women’s access to insurance and help mitigate their risks.
According to a 2015 survey by AIA Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan women are the main influencers and decision makers when it concerns their family’s protection and future, and are proactive in safeguarding their health and financial well-being. Given the low insurance penetration rate in the country – which stands at 1.7% – targeting women and addressing their protection needs can help insurers reach a larger pool of Sri Lankans and increase the number of insured.
“Our partnership with IFC will allow AIA to better reach women through insurance – a key and an underserved segment in Sri Lanka – and empower them to protect what is most important to them,” said AIA Sri Lanka CEO Nikhil Advani. “We see opening up new job opportunities for women in this industry as a significant point in increasing the uptake in the women’s market. Female recruitment is an important part of our recruitment strategy and we truly do value our female employees for the perspective and value they bring to the organisation.”
The women’s market represents a $ 1.7 trillion opportunity for the insurance industry globally by 2030, according to an IFC report, ‘SheforShield: Insure Women to Better Protect All’. Over half of this growth is expected to come from emerging markets such as Sri Lanka.
“The pandemic has thrown into sharp focus the need for adequate insurance products and services. We know the impact on women, their families and their businesses has been disproportionately high,” said IFC Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives Amena Arif. “Our work with AIA will increase access to suitable insurance products for not just women but the overall population. It will also help bring more women into this industry as employees, agents or leaders.”
This partnership with AIA Sri Lanka is part of IFC’s Women’s Insurance program, which is supported by the government of Australia under the IFC-DFAT Women in Work program. As IFC marks 50 years of operations in Sri Lanka in 2020, this partnership is in sync with IFC’s country strategy, where promoting financial inclusion is one of the top priorities.

Reserves at $ 6.7 b, rupee records 0.3% appreciation in Sept.

A net inflow of foreign investment amounting to $ 9 million was recorded from the rupee denominated government securities market in September 2020, reducing the cumulative net outflow to $ 512 million during the period from January to September 2020, the Central Bank said in its latest External Performance report for September.
The total outstanding exposure of foreign investment in the rupee-denominated Government securities market remained relatively negligible at $ 72 million by end September 2020.
There was a net outflow of $ 42 million from the primary and secondary markets of the CSE in September 2020. On a cumulative basis, the CSE recorded a net outflow of $ 215 million during the nine months ending September 2020.
Meanwhile, long-term loans to the Government recorded a net inflow of $ 50 million in August 2020 (data available only up to end August 2020).
The level of gross official reserves amounted to $ 6.7 billion at end September 2020, which was equivalent to 4.7 months of imports. Total foreign assets, which consist of gross official reserves and foreign assets of the banking sector, amounted to $ 9.2 billion at end September 2020, providing an import cover of 6.5 months.
The Sri Lankan Rupee recorded a marginal appreciation of 0.3% during September 2020, after demonstrating some volatility in the middle of the month. Overall, the rupee has recorded only a marginal depreciation of 1.5% against the US Dollar thus far during the year up to 6 November.
With a view to building up gross official reserves, the Central Bank continued to intervene in the domestic foreign exchange market by purchasing foreign exchange in September 2020 as well. During the year up to end October 2020, the Central Bank has absorbed $ 302.6 million, on a net basis.
Meanwhile, reflecting cross-currency movements, the Sri Lankan Rupee depreciated against the Euro, the Pound Sterling, the Japanese Yen and the Australian Dollar, while appreciating against the Indian Rupee in 2020 up to 6 November.

A USflag is seen on the New York Stock Exchange in the Manhattan borough of New York City, following the 2020 US presidential election, New York – Reuters)

NEW YORK (Reuters): Investors and financial executives took a big sigh of relief on Saturday after major networks declared Democrat Joe Biden winner of the U.S. presidential election, offering some certainty after days of conflicting reports about who might run the White House next term.
Although current President Donald Trump said he would fight the results in court, Wall Streeters who offered comments felt there was little doubt Biden would ultimately succeed. Election predictors including the Associated Press, NBC, Fox News and Edison Research, upon which Reuters relies, called the presidency for Biden.
“Biden is good news for the markets,” Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer at Sunrise Capital Partners, said on Saturday. “We’re all so tired of the whipsaw that came with the Trump tweets.”
Major U.S. stock indexes registered their biggest weekly gains since April this week, as investors bet Biden would win and Republicans would hold onto the Senate. That scenario would create a steadier hand in the Oval Office and a Congress that would check left-leaning impulses on taxes or regulations that pinch companies, investors said.
However, there are lingering risks to asset prices in the days and weeks ahead.
Republicans have already filed several lawsuits over ballot counting and Trump said his campaign will file more. The litigation could drag out election proceedings.
Investor focus also now turns to the Senate, which remains undecided ahead of two runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5. The significance of those races, which could potentially end up with the Democrats controlling all three of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, means January is “the new November” in terms of election volatility risk, Michael Purves, founder and CEO of Tallbacken Capital, said in a note to clients. Purves said that was evident when looking at contracts for the stockmarket’s fear gauge, the VIX, stretching out into the months ahead.
Beyond those battles, investors have been worried about the people Biden might appoint to his Cabinet. Some of those officials would be negotiating with Congress about a relief package and have extensive powers to craft Wall Street rules.
Current U.S. Federal Reserve governor and former McKinsey consultant Lael Brainard’s name has been floated as a potential Treasury Secretary, while Biden has already tapped former derivatives market regulator and Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Gary Gensler for advice on financial regulation.

U.S. messaging service WhatsApp launched a payments service in India after receiving approval from regulators. India, with some 400 million users, is WhatsApp's largest market – Reuters

DELHI (Reuters): Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp will start its payments service in India on Friday, the messaging app said in a blog post, after it received approval from the country’s leading payments processor to roll out the much-delayed system.
WhatsApp, which counts India as its biggest market with more than 400 million users, had been running a peer-to-peer payments service with limited users for over two years, awaiting regulatory approvals.
“Payments is available now in 10 Indian regional language versions of WhatsApp,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in video statement.
WhatsApp said it had partnered with five Indian banks, including State Bank of India and Jio Payments Bank, for the service.
WhatsApp will initially begin scaling up the service with a maximum of 20 million users, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) said on Thursday.
All major payments players in India use the UPI framework, built by NPCI, for services such as peer-to-peer money transfer, utility payments and phone recharges.
UPI processed over 2.07 billion transactions in October, up from over 1.8 billion the previous month, according to NPCI.
WhatsApp will compete with Alphabet Inc’s Google, Walmart’s PhonePe and Alibaba -backed Paytm in India’s digital payments market, which is expected to more than double in size to $ 135 billion in 2023 from 2019 levels, according to PwC and Indian industry lobby group ASSOCHAM.
Facebook earlier this year bought a 9.99% stake in Reliance’s digital unit for $ 5.7 billion, an investment that will give WhatsApp an inside track on payments for Reliance’s retail unit, which aims to serve tens of millions of small shops across India.

The COVID-19 crisis has become a financial crisis for hundreds of thousands of Sri Lanka’s senior citizens, savers and charitable institutions. Those who have invested their life savings in fixed deposits and were living on the interest income will take an over 50% reduction of their income with the plummeting of bank and finance company deposit rates. 
Elderly people could risk running out of money before they die. Charitable institutions will have to half their philanthropic activities. The unprecedentedly low interest rates, whilst could be a boon for borrowers, will hurt those who depend on modest nest eggs for a safe income. Live on less, dip deeply into savings or take on more risk: Those are the nasty choices that many people will be facing. The dilemma is most pressing for those planning for retirement or already in it.

All time low interest rates have reduced interest income by 52%
The one-year Treasury bill Weighted Average Yield Rate at the auction held on 23 October recorded a new all-time low of 4.13%. 
Deposit rates offered to customers have come down faster as banks hasten to cut their funding cost in a bid to maintain margins, which are narrowing in line with the falling lending rates Interest paid on one year fixed deposit by banks is now around 5.5% per annum resulting in a reduction of interest income for fixed deposit income by 52.2% for a non-tax payer. 
Interest income of tax payers will be further impacted due to the removal of 5% final withholding tax (WHT) that was previously applicable for interest income depending on the tax bracket they may fall into if their total income (i.e. employment, investment and business income) exceed Rs. 3 million per annum.
The Government allows a special senior citizens’ (for those who are over 60 years of age) one Fixed Deposit at 15% per annum or 14.06%. Monthly in a commercial bank up to a maximum of Rs. 1.5 million to minimise the impact. However, such a deposit will generate only an income of Rs. 17,575 monthly.
The real income of those however, will depend on the rate of inflation in the economy. The Department of Census and Statistics in its 21 October press release indicated that the Year-on-Year (YOY) inflation as measured by NCPI is 6.4% and the YOY inflation of the Food Group was 12.7% in September 2020. This mean the people and charitable funds who depend on interest income will not be able to buy the same bucket of food or carry out their benevolent activities with the interest income from their Fixed Deposit investments for a few years or more.
Investors around the world are facing the same problem. Bank accounts, money-market accounts and other short-term instruments no longer offer a decent return and perhaps negative in real terms when compared with inflation. With rates going nowhere anytime soon, get ready for even more difficult times ahead.

How low interest rates effect the economy
Governments throughout the world supported by their central banks have been on a path to push interest rates down. The envisaged objective is to stimulate their economies that have fallen into negative growth by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Since it has added to the misery of people, cutting down both employment and welfare levels, the governments have thought that the best way to help people is to flood them with bank credit at low interest rates. 
However, when central banks allow interest rates to approach, or fall below, what is quaintly termed “the zero-lower bound” there are clear losers. Banks are presuming that households, obedient to monetary policy theory, will borrow more money at still lower rates. In fact, the reality is that “lower for longer” prevents a robust recovery because it makes economic inequality worse. 
There is clear evidence that despite maintaining ultra-low interest rates, central banks of the world’s leading economies have largely failed to bring about steady and healthy growth.
There is a growing consensus among economists and a strong body of evidence that, traditional monetary measures to stimulate the economy actually do more harm than good. They contribute to rising inequality, for lower interest rates benefit mostly the wealthy, who already have large financial holdings, and hurt middle-class families and retirees who depend on their investments and savings for a living. It is doubtful that current lowering of interest rates will boost investment and help the economy. 
The current problems in the world economy are the result of the shock produced by the COVID-19, both on demand and supply sides, as it disrupted global supply chains, prompted governments around the world to close borders and severely restrict people’s movement. Therefore, it is unlikely that rate cuts will generate productive investments at a time when companies prefer to save rather than to invest not due to high costs of borrowing and “high” interest rates but because of the uncertainty associated with the pandemic.
Further, fixing interest rates arbitrarily by a regulator should be done carefully. This is because there are two parties involved in the determination of interest rates and when the Central Bank reduces interest rates, one party is benefitted while the other party is harmed. No economy can move forward on a sustainable basis when one party is benefiting at the expense of the other party.

Dos and don’ts when interest rates are low
Dos:
1. If you have a housing loan re-finance or negotiate a lower rate to pay off debt may be your best investment, and low interest rates help you pay off loans faster and protection of scarce assets, and effective use of financial services.
2. If you are 60 years of age or more make use of the Special Senior Citizens Fixed Deposit scheme that offer 15% p.a. or 14.05% monthly for one Rs. 1.5 m deposit for one year from any one of the commercial banks.
3. Know your tolerance to risks – Find out the credit rating of the financial institution before you invest (Credit ratings can be obtained from the respective financial institution or by searching www.fitchratings.com and www.icralanka.com websites).
4. Shop around, switch financial institutions and hard negotiate your FD interest rate (depends on your relationship with the financial institution), before your FD mature; do not leave it to be automatically renewed.
5. Spread your fixed deposits among your family members from an estate and tax planning perspective.
6. Spread your money across different fixed income asset classes such as Money market and Income Funds offered by Unit Trusts Companies, listed debentures to increase returns and to reduce your overall risk.
7. Consider investing a small part of your wealth in more risky assets such as equity, start with high dividend paying stocks with dividend growth potential listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange. There are over 30 stocks that have given a dividend yield of over 6% and some over 10% historically, which should deliver a higher return over the long run, provided they can sustain their dividend pay-out. 
Don’ts:
1. Trust third parties who may claim to be from well-known institutions, check the authenticity of deposit certificate vs. the institution – do not invest in un-licensed, un-regulated entities, Ponzi/pyramid schemes.
2. Invest in schemes that offer unusually high rates – Realise that if any institution to offer higher rates, they in turn have to take higher risks, which you may not know. 
3. Shy away from investing in the stock market because the value of the principle you invest fluctuates daily. Volatility is a known risk when investing in stock markets. Understand what you are investing in and seek professional advice.

Become financially literate
Sri Lanka has the highest gap between print literacy and financial literacy in the region. On average, 65% of adults in advanced economies are financially literate. Financial literacy in Sri Lanka is about 35%. It is spread across all social strata from the poor to the professionals.
Many dishonest organisations operate illegally or outside of the legal framework in Sri Lanka. They mobilise high interest-paying deposits and thrive on the financially illiterate who, because of their sheer lack of financial knowledge, only focus on the rate of return and do not recognise the risks of the financial institution they entrust their hard earned money.
The first and foremost step is to educate yourself to become skilled at making, controlling and safeguarding your money. There is no shortcut to spending some time to learn, being financially literate clearly benefits individuals and their households, since they are able to make better and more informed decisions when it comes to saving and borrowing money. 
I strongly encourage each and every one of you and also persuade your loved ones to download and read the 30 odd page booklet, available free of charge at www.cfasrilanka.lk. Further, a webinar recording is available on YouTube – search for ‘Financial Literacy: To survive the dark side of low interest rates’ on YouTube.

Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals deployed by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon at retail outlets across Sri Lanka have shown exponential growth in cashless payment volumes, thus becoming the fastest growing POS network in the country, the bank reports.
The market leader in combined credit and debit card usage in Sri Lanka, Commercial Bank is also one of the biggest facilitators of card-based payments, with an offering of state-of-the art wired as well as wireless POS terminals, including Android-powered devices with QR code capability that cater to the steadily increasing volume of cashless transactions in Sri Lanka.
Commenting on this achievement by the bank’s POS network, the Head of Commercial Bank’s Card Centre Thusitha Suraweera said: “Our technology motivates merchants and customers alike to opt for cashless transactions. Greater convenience and security drive incremental sales for the merchants. According to statistics published by the Central Bank, there are approximately 23 million debit cards in Sri Lanka which are primarily used at ATMs to withdraw cash. A much smaller number is used at POS machines. We hope to change this dynamic, by widening access to cashless transactions that are secure and convenient.”
Commercial Bank recently launched Sri Lanka’s first LANKAQR supported Android operating system based POS device to facilitate cashless payments at merchant outlets countrywide. The bank is also working with several other companies to develop similar solutions for the market. To further add convenience to customers, the Android POS is Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled. 
The inclusion of NFC technology enables contact-less transactions for customers with payment processing via just a tap on the terminal. Positioned as the most-advanced Android POS device in the country, the Android Smart Terminal combines the functionality and portability of an Android terminal with tailored security-certified payments software enabling it to process transactions via VISA, Mastercard, UnionPay and JCB cards through LankaPay, as well as QR Code based payments under LANKAQR. 
The QR Code presented at Commercial Bank POS machines under LANKAQR also facilitates mVisa and Mastercard QR access and will soon be expanded to cover UnionPay QR acceptance as well. This facility offers consumers a frictionless payment experience and reduces the waiting time at checkout counters.
For merchants who prefer a simpler method of digital payments acceptance, the bank also offers the Easy POS device which is a card reader that can be paired with a smartphone via Bluetooth.  
Commercial Bank has also launched an Android Mini POS device, a fully functional, sleek and smart terminal with SIM and Wi-Fi connectivity. All Android POS devises issued by the bank are available with a tri-lingual user interface. This technology is positioned as a cost-effective solution for the SME industry and is expected to further expand the cashless ecosystem. 
Commercial Bank cards are the fastest growing cards in Sri Lanka and enjoy market leadership in credit and debit card cumulative point-of-sale usage. The bank offers a variety of credit cards in the Silver, Gold and Platinum tiers of Visa, Mastercard and UnionPay Cards, as well as Visa Signature, World Mastercard, Visa Infinite, UnionPay Asia Prestige Platinum and UnionPay Asia Prestige Diamond Cards in the premium segment. The cards are equipped with ‘Tap ’n Go’ NFC technology and are backed by a strong NFC Point-of-Sale (POS) network.

Offering customer’s greater avenues of convenience coupled with a future-fit payment security model Genie, Sri Lanka’s first PCI-DSS-certified payment app, powered by Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s premier connectivity provider, has adopted tokenisation technology to eliminate friction in its payment process and provide a quick checkout experience.
With increased attention surrounding mobile payments and a myriad of merchants migrating online, payment security is an integral factor in ensuring customer confidence by reducing the risk of fraud and digital data breaches in the platforms they are operating on. 
Tokenisation is a widely used method of replacing sensitive information, such as a primary account number (PAN) of a customer’s credit/ debit card, with a random string of unique characters called “tokens” which are sent across the payment gateway for processing without the actual card details being exposed to the merchant. 
Widely used, this encryption method is an effective and secure alternative when transferring sensitive information, adding an extra level of security to credit and debit card payments and fast becoming a catalyst in fighting fraud whilst creating a seamless payment process.
At present, Genie allows customers to store their details in a ‘One-Click-Pay’ option across several partner merchants, who also support tokenisation technology, facilitating them with greater convenience in not having to enter their payment details each time they perform a transaction for those particular merchants. At present, Genie’s partner merchants who support tokenisation include Eat Me Global, chargeNET, eLogic Lanka, and Dialog Axiata’s own MyDialog app.
Speaking on the integration, Dialog Axiata PLC Group Chief Digital Services Officer Renuka Fernando said: “Genie stands empathetic to the diverse needs of modern customers and continuously aims to find sustainable digital solutions to meet those growing dynamic needs. Through the adoption of tokenisation technology, Genie will enable the digital commerce arena in Sri Lanka to flourish by giving customers and merchants total confidence in the security behind their transactions. As we continue to grow the tokenisation process on the Genie platform by onboarding new merchants, Genie will continue to improve the system with more features in time to come.”

By Atchuthan Srirangan

In every market scenario, a few investors become rich and others become poor. The rich and the poor are due to those who believe and do not believe in rebalancing.
Investment is always half-hearted unless rebalancing is done. Booking profits and converting notional profits into real profits is an art and science activity. Controlling, one’s greed and fear while rebalancing is very strange and complicated human behaviour which is hard to be adopted by an investor. 
It has been found that often investors criticise the concept called long-term investments particularly when the market goes for a tailspin. Well for all those who burnt their fingers, for them asset allocation and rebalancing are unknown words. Only equity and debt, but low and sell high are not investment concepts.
Investment is always for a long-term ride provided you know the concept of rebalancing just like changing gears of a car. As you change the gear of the car at various points while travelling a long drive, one also has to use rebalancing as gear to change the asset allocation. Every road is not a highway, similarly every investment cannot just climb high and high.
Often, we find that there is the confusion that which investment to be sold and which one to be kept under hold. Well, asset allocation helps to resolve this gap. The behavioural finance aspect of rebalancing itself is as difficult as doing new investments.  We have witnessed that rebalancing has been taken as a blind tool where an investor sells his good apples and keeps his bad apples in the expectation that the price will go up. This behavioural aspect cannot be ruled in this case.
Rebalancing is not about selling the good apples and holding bad ones. It is about asset reallocation. Rebalancing introduces one to asset allocation concepts and how a long-term wealth portfolio is created through asset allocation.
Rebalancing is not a high-frequency activity. It is an act that is initiated when one asset class performance is more than the desired objective.
One of the first steps you need to take in investing is to determine the asset allocation appropriate for your particular financial goals. For example, let’s say you’re shooting for a well-funded retirement that’s set to start in 35 years. Given that long timeframe and your personal comfort level with volatility, you decide to take an aggressive investing approach and go with an asset allocation of 90% stocks and 10% fixed income for your retirement portfolio.
But because the market can move around so much each day, that allocation is bound to change over time, if left alone. So, to maintain the status quo (or breakdown) of your portfolio, you need to act. And that action is what we call rebalancing.
For rebalancing, there are two main approaches to this task. The first approach, and the one that we will focus on here, is the time-based approach, where you rebalance on a set schedule. The other approach is called the rebalancing band approach, which does not rebalance until an asset class moves outside of pre-specified bands. In other words, it lets the portfolio run until it drifts too far out of line, and then it brings that portion of the portfolio back into line.

Rebalancing

Ones which do not fit in the long-term goal of investments and destroys other income assets those investments need a rebalancing
Taking decision of rebalancing get restricted to maintain the status quo and not acting upon to take proper action from inaction
Market times and market sentiments kill
Know the assets before investing
Invest in knowledge and then assets
Financial planning and advisory keep avoiding these deaths traps which lead to loss of capital and create fear and lack of confidence for long-term investing
Good investment opportunities are lost due to a lack of confidence; seek financial planning and you will be able to save from loss of confidence
Financial advisors protect one’s portfolio through his education on financial advisory and experience
Hiring a well-educated financial planner is another important task
Don’t throw good money after bad money, since money lost is money gone
Not taking a rebalancing decision is a decision that has its consequences; similarly, only savings in safer assets have their own risk hence invest with proper asset allocation based on your risk profile

In this pandemic time, the global economic debt has swelled significantly and hence the equity market will have an extensive high volatile ride. Further, in many places, its being found that the current equity market rally is based on few stocks, hence the broader market participation is less, hence those who are not aware of rebalancing will need more of the same. Asset allocation and rebalancing is the only tool for the coming decade to manage your investment portfolio.

HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters): China suspended Ant Group’s $37 billion listing on Tuesday, thwarting the world’s largest stock market debut with just days to go in a dramatic blow to the financial technology firm founded by billionaire Jack Ma.
The Shanghai stock exchange said it had suspended the company’s initial public offering (IPO) on its tech-focused STAR Market, prompting Ant to also freeze the Hong Kong leg of its dual listing scheduled for Thursday.
This followed a meeting with China’s financial regulators on Monday during which Ma and his top executives were told that Ant’s lucrative online lending business would face tighter scrutiny, sources told Reuters.
The Shanghai bourse described Ant’s meeting with financial regulators as a “major event” which, along with a tougher regulatory environment, may cause Ant to be disqualified from listing.
In China, analysts interpreted the move as a slap down for Ma, who had wanted Ant to be treated as technology company rather than a highly regulated financial institution.
“The Communist Party has shown the tycoons who’s boss. Jack Ma might be the richest man in the world but that doesn’t mean a thing. This has gone from the deal of the century to the shock of the century,” Francis Lun, CEO of GEO Securities, said.
To revive its listing, Ant is trying to establish if it needs to disclose more information to the Shanghai exchange about its relationship with regulators, or if the bourse expects it to resolve all its issues with the regulators, which would take much longer, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
At an event last month attended by Chinese regulators, Ma said the financial and regulatory system stifled innovation and must be reformed to fuel growth. He also compared the Basel Committee of global banking regulators to “an old man’s club”.
Ant believes the public criticism put Ma in the crosshairs of regulators, the person said.
The suspension reverberated across markets. Alibaba Group Holding, which owns about a third of Ant, fell 9% in early U.S. trading, wiping nearly $76 billion off its value, more than double the amount Ant was planning to raise.
“This is a curve ball that has been thrown at us ... I don’t know what to say,” said one banker working on the IPO.
SHARPER SCRUTINY
With its unique business model and the absence of rivals in China or elsewhere, analysts say Ant has mainly thrived as a technology platform away from the banking sector’s regulations, despite its array of financial products.
But Beijing has become uncomfortable with banks increasingly using micro-lenders or third-party technology platforms such as Ant for underwriting loans amid fears of rising defaults and a deterioration in asset quality in a pandemic-hit economy.
Reuters reported last month that regulators had scrutinised banks that used Ant’s technology platform excessively for underwriting consumer loans as part of a drive to curb risks in the country’s financial sector.
The tougher regulatory focus on Ant’s cash cow and rapidly growing consumer lending business had emerged as a key concern for investors in the IPO, despite the company’s attractiveness as a financial technology player.
Ant originates demand from retail consumers and small businesses and passes that on to about 100 banks for underwriting, earning fees from the lenders with minimal risk to its own balance sheet.
Ant’s consumer lending balance was 1.7 trillion yuan ($254 billion) at the end of June, or 21% of all short-term consumer loans issued by Chinese deposit-taking financial institutions. Only 2% of the loans it had facilitated were on its balance sheet, its IPO prospectus showed.
“It’s the right move to regulate what’s essentially a financial institution as their peers. And it’s wrong not to do that in the past, and the mistake is being corrected. It will have a negative impact on pricing,” said Zhong Daqi, founding partner of Guangzhou Zeyuan Investment Management Co.
Under draft rules published on Monday by China’s central bank and banking regulator, small online lenders must provide at least 30% of any loan they fund jointly with banks.
A banker in Hong Kong close to other Chinese fintechs said those firms thought the new rules were tailor-made for Ant. The banker said Ant may have to split its businesses and make payments, micro-lending and wealth management separate units.
Ant was set to go public in Hong Kong and Shanghai on Thursday after raising about $37 billion - including the so-called greenshoe option of the domestic leg - in a record IPO that had attracted leading global investment firms.
It was also a sensational draw for mom-and-pop investors in China and Hong Kong who bid a record $3 trillion, equivalent to the annual economic output of Britain, while for the Hong Kong leg retail investors borrowed heavily from banks to buy shares.
An official at a Chinese state-backed investment firm, which is also an existing investor in Ant, wondered whether it would be “politically correct” to make fresh investments in the company given its regulatory run-in.
Starting as a payments processor in 2004, Ant quickly built an empire by offering users short-term loans credited within minutes, as well as selling insurance and investment products.
China’s state-backed Economic Daily newspaper said in a commentary that the IPO suspension showed regulators’ determination to protect the interests of investors and the most pressing matter was for Ant to carry out “rectifications”.
“Ant may be just falling victim to their own size and success,” said Alex Sirakov, senior associate at advisory firm Kapronasia.
Ant apologized to investors for any inconvenience, adding it would give further details on the suspension of its Hong Kong listing and applications for refunds as soon as possible.
“We will properly handle the follow-up matters in accordance with applicable regulations of the two stock exchanges.”
Alibaba said it would support Ant to adapt and embrace the evolving regulatory framework.

The award further strengthens our long-standing relationship with the ADB, which exclusively reached out to us in Sri Lanka for this deal. At a time the COVID-19 pandemic is gripping the world, it is truly reflective of our promise ‘Here for good’, that we were able to facilitate this deal for People’s Bank to enable the State Pharmaceutical Corporation’s operations to purchase medical supplies to aid in the national initiative against COVID-19 and to benefit the people of Sri Lanka.” The annual TSCFP Awards (formerly TFP Awards) follow a rigorous evaluation process undertaken independently. The awards covered transactions from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020 and considered how ‘TFP’ the transaction was, by factoring in three main elements; Trade impact, Footprint and Partnership. It evaluated the impact the transaction has had on the country, the role it plays in helping the client improve their business, and how the ADB’s Trade and Finance Programme contributed to the success of the transaction.  “The Trade Finance Deal of the Year 2020 award comes at a pivotal time for Standard Chartered Sri Lanka, when the Standard Chartered Group has committed to support partners working towards the elimination of COVID-19. The significance of this transaction for People’s Bank, the State Pharmaceutical Corporation and the country is amply recognised by the ADB through this award,” stated Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Head of Financial Institutions Lakshan Goonetilleke commenting on the award-winning deal.

State Minister Cabraal

 




The 8th Capital Markets Conference (CAPM) will be held on 10 November. The conference will feature a dazzling array of speakers and panellists, with State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms, the Honourable Ajith Nivard Cabraal, delivering the keynote address. The speakers will represent a cross section of stakeholders, thereby providing the registered participants with different perspectives. 
CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranayake will make a formal presentation on the ‘Outlook for the Stock Market’ while Candor Holdings CEO/Group Director Ravi Abeysuriya will provide an ‘Investor Perspective on the introduction of REITs’ to the Sri Lankan market. 
Both these presentations will be followed by panel discussions on the respective topics and a panel discussion on capital markets, in general, will also feature at the event. 
The key sessions will be moderated by Daily FT Editor Nisthar Cassim, KPMG in Sri Lanka Principal Suresh Perera and Adl Capital Director Mafaz Ishaq, whilst some of the panellists confirmed thus far include Acuity Partners MD/Group CEO Ray Abeywardena, JKSE Consultants Principal Consultant Lasintha Ferdinando, KPMG in Sri Lanka Director Tax and Regulatory Hasna Hassan, NDB Wealth Management COO and Unit Trust Association of Sri Lanka President Ruwan Perera, and KPMG in Sri Lanka Director, Deal Advisory Ajantha Weerasekera. 
CAPM 2020 will assume a new format, with the event commencing post-lunch, thus enabling stock market participants to also participate in this annual event, held for the eighth successive year. Furthermore, due to the restrictions placed on holding live events, the conference will be held for the first time on a virtual platform. 
The timing seems opportune in light of the positivity that seems to have encapsulated the capital markets and the stock market, in particular. Whilst this may have been dampened somewhat by the sudden and unexpected rise in COVID-19 cases, there is still an underlying resilience that the markets are undoubtedly exhibiting, in the aftermath of the elections.
The formal launch of REITs has also caused a sense of anticipation among not just the capital market players but also in ancillary industries. It has given the capital markets an impetus that has fast dispelled the gloom that pervaded the market and the country, as a whole, during the period in which the entire country was in lockdown.

Says over 1,100 motor claims within 1 hour every month


The notion of lengthy claim settlement processes after an accident is a time consuming and strenuous situation for a customer. With this understanding, Fairfirst introduced a revolutionary virtual assessment technology known as Click2Claim (C2C), where a policyholder is able to conduct a self-inspection of the damage virtually – by converting their phone camera into video mode. 
Via C2C, Fairfirst has now become the fastest claim settler in the country by assessing and settling motor claims instantly, thus enabling the company to settle 1,100 claims within an hour and 1,800 claims within a day on a monthly basis. 
In setting new standards in insurance, the company believes its core job is to settle claims and it does so efficiently by being fair and fast in its dealings so that people can get back on track without hindering their progression in life. 
In a time where customers are used to claims being predominantly handled via an assessor visiting the accident site, Fairfirst’s proactive approach set new standards in the market. The company redefined the whole claim settlement process by completely eliminating the time wasted at the accident site waiting for an assessor. Further, it fast tracked the claim settlement process by providing instant claims.
For customers with Fairfirst, this hassle-free process starts by customers calls being answered in under three seconds by a 24/7 Call Centre to guide customers on expediting their claims. Thereafter, the claims experts come onboard to take on the process of handling all claim intimations virtually. 
Therefore, in the unfortunate event of an accident, the customer has to contact the Fairfirst Call Centre on 0112 428 428 who will connect the call through to the claims experts to start a video-based assessment of the damage on real-time basis. As this process is done through the help of smartphones and data connectivity, a customer’s claim can be assessed and paid in full in less than 10 minutes, depending on the nature of the damage.  Fairfirst also makes sure that every step of their customer’s journey is uplifted in an empathetic manner through their additional value-added services such as: the availability of a 24/7 island-wide free Roadside Assistance Cover along with access to more than 100 EasyFix garages island-wide for cashless repairs that come with a warranty. 
Being the most innovative insurer makes the road ahead clear for Fairfirst and much more convenient for customers. Theirs is a commitment in providing a ‘Fair and Fast’ solution at all times thus ensuring the values of Empathy, Authenticity, Responsibility and Safety especially in the context of promoting social distancing.
Despite being a relatively young brand, Fairfirst Insurance has secured a strong foothold in the market while leading digital disruption in the industry. As testimony to its innovation, Fairfirst Insurance was recently awarded the ‘Best Online Insurance Company in Sri Lanka’ at the Global Banking & Finance Awards 2020. 
Fairfirst also achieved the distinction of being the only Sri Lankan company to be listed in the ‘2020 Top Insurance Workplaces in Asia-Pacific’ by Insurance Business Asia. This is yet another global recognition for Fairfirst in Sri Lanka and comes on the heels of the ‘Most Innovative’ award across the Fairfax Group of Companies located around the globe while also being featured as one of the youngest brands in the ‘Top 100 Brands Directory in Sri Lanka 2020’.
Fairfirst Insurance is part of the Canadian based Fairfax Group. Fairfax, through its subsidiaries, has an international insurance and reinsurance business with a global underwriting reach, longstanding relationships and a broad product range.

A doubling of the market cap of the stock market does not do any good for Heen Banda in Kekirawa or Murugan in Kilinochchi or Malini in Minuwangoda or the millions of others like them. The creation of wealth through the stock market is exclusive growth in the sense that it benefits only a few. The stock exchange can become a facilitator of inclusive growth if it removes the two road blocks to inclusive growth


A common sense view


“Economics is common sense, theoretical economics is common sense made difficult” – I believe that many years ago Professor Pigou at Cambridge University made this statement. 
I recalled this recently, when I saw many statements in the press that it was necessary to increase the market capitalisation of the stock market, as it will be a major contributor to a revival of the economy. Some well-known people have added their names to this theory. Due to this hype the stock market often gets front page top billing in the Daily FT!
I was puzzled and could not figure out the theory that would elucidate the link between the market cap of the stock market and growth of the economy. Maybe I have forgotten my theoretical economics. There may well be some economic theory linking the two. As I could not recall the theory I sought refuge in the words of Prof. Pigou and went down the common sense route to unravel this hypothesis.

The stock market
This refers to the market/exchange trading in shares. People buy or sell shares through the Stock Exchange. Details are published in the papers of the prices at which shares traded. 
The market capitalisation of any company is the number of shares in the company multiplied by the latest price at which these shares were traded in the stock market. When you add up the market value of all the listed companies you get the market capitalisation of the Stock Exchange.

Movements in market capitalisation
The question is, ‘What is the significance of an increase in the value of the total stock market?’ Perhaps it indicates that investors believe that the trading performance of companies will improve and the share price will rise and the very process of bidding for shares at higher prices pushes the value of the total market. 
This is a little like my horse racing betting shop, but in reverse. There, when money comes in for a horse, the odds drop and therefore a scramble to get the bet in before the odds drop. Here with the stock market it is to buy before the price increases.
Whether share prices will move up or down will depend SOLELY on the behaviour of those who buy and sell shares. No institution sets a share price. Many things will influence those trading in shares but in the end the bottom line is the perception of what is likely to happen in the future to earnings in the different companies. If one sees growth they buy and if they see a decline they will sell. In some ways it is like a game with the touch of a gamble.

Who plays buying and selling?
About 33,000 people do one or more transactions per quarter (three months). Another 37,000 do one or two transactions a year. This then adds up to the grand number of 72,000. It is well less than 1% of the population who play this game of buying and selling shares...
The Stock Exchange can be described as a small rich man’s club that plays a game of buying and selling shares to each other and that determines the total value of the stock market at any time. The Prof. Pigou approach of looking at the issue with common sense elucidates very clearly how the market capitalisation of every company is determined by very small number of people buying and selling shares to each other.
The market cap determined by the small number of players in this club has no direct link to creating economic growth for the country 
The question hanging in the air is, why do some people applaud an increase in the market cap of the Stock Exchange on the premise that it is good for the wellbeing of the economy? Perhaps they or their friends have a large holding of shares and will benefit from an increase in the price of shares.

Foreign buyers
There are a number of foreign firms trading in the market. Many large firms in the financial arena in the UK and elsewhere have funds and most invariably have a few funds linked to Asian shares. They then of necessity must carry such shares in their portfolio and some will have Sri Lankan quoted shares. 
These funds are more often than not traders, buying and selling for profit, as they have to pay dividends to investors in their funds. These firms cannot be perceived as long-term providers of foreign exchange.

Paper billionaires
Persons with large holdings of shares (and there are many) are deemed billionaires if their holding multiplied by the prevailing share price exceeds a billion rupees. When the market price of their shares change their wealth will also change accordingly. 
They are paper billionaires because they could not all convert their shares into cash. There are no buyers to support the sale of shares of all those who now own more than a billion rupees worth of shares!

Exclusive growth
A doubling of the market cap of the stock market does not do any good for Heen Banda in Kekirawa or Murugan in Kilinochchi or Malini in Minuwangoda or the millions of others like them. The creation of wealth through the stock market is exclusive growth in the sense that it benefits only a few.
The Stock Exchange can become a facilitator of inclusive growth if it aggressively follows an approach that will take it down this road and removes the two road blocks to inclusive growth.

The problem 
The problem is twofold. The big companies listed on the Stock Exchange have only a relatively small percentage hovering around 20% available to the public. If you look at the annual reports of public companies the top 10 or so shareholders are listed and one can clearly see how the controlling owners directly and through subsidiary companies hold the greater majority of the shares. 
The controlling owners then have to pay out to public shareholders only a small part of the profits (often around 20%) and this helps them to increase their earnings and helps the accumulation of cash with them. That cash will sponsor investment and growth and profits but again 80 %will be pocketed by the controlling owners
The other problem in creating inclusive growth is that a large number of big companies are not quoted and are private companies owned totally by the owning families. Some of the big names that are private with the public not having even one share are MAS, Brandix, Maliban, Munchee (Ceylon Biscuits) and some other big boys have a token public shareholding.
The Stock Exchange can be very different from its current rich man’s club and become an agent for inclusive growth if it becomes the catalyst that brings about this change from exclusive growth to inclusive growth defined as “a concept that advances equitable opportunities for economic participants during economic growth with benefits for every section of society”.
If 80% of the quoted shares were held by the public including funds (which is a good vehicle to enable the public at large, the Heen Bandas, Murugans and Malinis to be shareholders) and if companies above a defined size were compelled to become public quoted companies, with 80% of the shares held by the public, the stock market will be an agent of inclusive growth.
The only way the large companies can be made to dilute and the private companies to become public companies is through taxation. If the tax rate for public companies is 25%, those with less than 80% pubic shareholding should pay 60% and private companies above a certain threshold should pay the same rate. That will focus the mind and hopefully lead to a change in behaviour.

BENGALURU (Reuters): Bets against the US Dollar were expected to linger or even increase in the immediate aftermath of the 3 November Presidential Election, despite jitters in the run-up along with surging coronavirus cases, a Reuters poll showed.
After trading within tight ranges for much of October, the greenback rose to a four-week high on Friday on fears the election results will be contested in the courts, along with economic damage from renewed lockdowns in Europe.
Traders reduced net short dollar bets in the latest week, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But bets against the US currency have outstripped those in favour for 31 weeks in a row and that is set to carry on.
In the 27 October to 2 November Reuters poll, nearly 70% of analysts, or 29 of 42, said net short dollar positions would either stay the same or rise further immediately after the election. Only 13 said they would ease off.
“The dollar’s move is obviously dependent on the election, but what is striking is ... how little territory the dollar has been able to gain, and if anything, this pullback is viewed by many investors as a dollar-selling opportunity,” said Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered.
Thirty-nine of 60 analysts with a view said the election outcome would be the biggest driver of the dollar over the coming weeks rather than the coronavirus spread, where the United States leads the world in daily infections.
Slightly fewer than half of respondents, 25 of 57, said incumbent Donald Trump getting re-elected along with a continued Republican Senate – seen as unlikely according to poll averages – is the outcome that would bring about a stronger dollar.
The broader Reuters survey of more than 70 respondents showed foreign exchange strategists expect the dollar to weaken against most major currencies over the coming year.
“USD positioning remains heavily skewed to net-short territory by its historical standards, but given the centrality of the US election risk event there is surely more room for those net shorts to be rebuilt into the dollar in a market-friendly election outcome,” said Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING.
Democratic challenger Joe Biden leads in national opinion polls and a win for him and his party taking the Senate would probably hurt the dollar, partly on expectations of a swift, large fiscal stimulus package.
“The USD oversold condition does suggest a surprise win by President Trump could easily trigger a material short-squeezing effect on the USD,” added ING’s Pesole.
A continued surge in coronavirus cases that has forced lockdowns in parts of Europe has pushed the European Central Bank to flag further monetary easing in December, pressuring the euro down to a four-week low on Friday.
The euro fell 0.6% against the dollar in October.
Still, the single currency was up nearly 4% for the year and was expected to rise further to around $1.18 in a month. In 12 months, it was expected to rise more than 4% to $1.21 from about $1.16 on Monday.
“The euro, which is largely a COVID-19 story, hasn’t been hurt as much as you would have expected,” said Standard Chartered’s Englander.
“The sense in the market is even though this is unexpectedly aggressive resurgence, it is also temporary. The market is reluctant to abandon the short dollar trade.”
Ongoing concerns over the economic drag from rising global infections have pushed stocks lower, and crude oil down by double-digits in a week on Friday.
Commodity-linked currencies fell against the dollar on Friday, and for some it was their worst week since the March collapse near the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
While that trend was likely to play out this week, in line with the broad expectations in the poll, the dollar was predicted to weaken against most major currencies over the coming year – including commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and the Canadian dollar.
“At some point we get back to what I call the fundamental view: the dollar is too expensive at these prices for the interest rate differentials that now exist in the world,” said Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale.
“We will see the dollar after the election, in all probability, return to the pandemic lows.”

Presentation of awards 

HNB Assurance PLC (HNBA) and its fully owned subsidiary HNB General Insurance Ltd. (HNBGI) celebrated the exceptional performances of Branch Managers and the key members of the Retail Banking Management Team of the Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB) recently, at Grandeeza, Negombo. 
The event was attended by Chief Guest HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles, Guest of Honour HNBA and HNBGI Chairperson Rose Cooray, HNBA and HNBGI Chief Executive Officer Prasantha Fernando, and other members representing the top management of HNB, HNBA and HNBGI.
Speaking at the ceremony, Alles stated: “I’m pleased to note the exceptional performance of our insurance arm during testing times and would like to congratulate all at HNBA and HNBGI led by the top team, for their outstanding contribution in achieving many ground breaking milestones during the year. My heartfelt gratitude goes out to my team at HNB who are felicitated tonight for their continuous support and the efforts made under challenging conditions. 
“HNB is the only systemically important bank in Sri Lanka with a meaningful presence in both life and general insurance. Given the low insurance penetration levels in the country and the strong presence of the bank, there’s a great opportunity for us to drive both life and general insurance business and add value to the customers of the entire group. I look forward to your continuous support and dedication as always, in navigating through turbulent times and achieving greater heights.”
Cooray stated: “I sincerely wish to acknowledge the tireless efforts of the bank, the two insurance companies as well as of the network and leadership teams, and I am confident this will be a rewarding night for all of them. This high-spirited gathering is ample testimony of teamwork, bringing us together today to show solidarity in the captivating drive and motivation of these team players. The Group has maintained top tier performance in the past years, taking it over to 2020 having managed to strategically turn away the challenges posed by the pandemic. With this very triumphant emergence, we are poised to grow well over the coming year, and I request all Branch Managers to extend their fullest support and continue efforts with vigour.”
Fernando stated: “Today’s commemoration brings together achievers from every corner of Sri Lanka setting stage to celebrate the exceptional performance, and the relationship the Group has cultivated over the years. This strong bond has led HNB, HNBA and HNBGI to grow as leaders in highly competitive markets, also thanks to farsighted leadership, and especially the invaluable input of corporate management and network management teams. Whilst extending my heartiest congratulations to all winners, I believe this strong support will continue leading the companies to end this year on a very positive note.”

In any country and in any instance, the heart that sustains the economy is the banking and finance sector. This industry is responsible for keeping the economy alive in times of crisis and also to restart the economy after this period of crisis has passed. Here, we take an in depth look at the finance industry and see how it has handled the pandemic period and how it plans to handle the way forward. 
The banking and finance sector is considered the lifeline of a country’s economy and one of the best people to talk to regarding this is none other than People’s Bank Chairman Sujeewa Rajapaksa. 
Rajapaksa is a Managing Partner of BDO Partners, the local representatives of BDO, the fifth largest accounting network in the world. He is a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (ICASL) and a fellow of the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA). He holds a Masters of Business Administration from the Postgraduate Institute of Management of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. 
During his professional career that has spanned nearly four decades, he held the honorary positions of President, Vice President and Council member of the ICASL. He was the former Chairman of the Auditing Standards Committee of ICASL and President of Practicing Accountants Forum of Sri Lanka. He was the Treasurer of Sri Lanka Cricket and the Treasurer for the Cricket World Cup in 2011. He was a Board Member and Technical Advisor to South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA) as well as the Technical Advisor to Confederation of Asia Pacific Accountants (CAPA). 
He has also served in the directorates of National Development Bank PLC (NDB), NDB Capital Ltd., Bangladesh and the Finance Company PLC. At present he serves as the Chairman of People’s Bank, Chairman of People’s Leasing & Finance PLC, an Independent Non-Executive Director of Haycarb PLC, Dipped Products PLC, Hayleys Agriculture Holdings Ltd., Uni-Dil Packaging Solutions Ltd., and as the Deputy Chairman of Softlogic Life Insurance PLC. 
Following are excerpts of an interview:






People’s Bank Chairman Sujeewa Rajapaksa

 




Q:  Obviously the banking and finance industry is the lifeline of an economy. Seeing as it is actually the heart that pumps the blood into the country’s life, how has this pandemic affected the finance sector? 
What you need to understand is that when there is any catastrophe, whether it’s in Sri Lanka, or any other developing country or even a developed country, the banking and finance industry is the most important industry. Liquidity or cash is the key in any economy. So when there is a pandemic like COVID, we need to understand that there’s a huge issue of limited liquidity flowing into the economy. This is where the finance or banking industry plays a key role.
If you really look at the banking industry in Sri Lanka, especially People’s Bank, we have a strong footing. With any bank, you need to have a very strong capital base. People’s Bank issued Rs. 20 billion debentures and these were grabbed up by a few investors within four hours, making it the highest ever in Sri Lanka. That means that our market is liquid. As a result, People’s Bank has been able to increase its capital base, which we call Basel III. Basel is an international organisation that considers risk factors, leverage and many more. In our bank, we have a solid footing like many other banks in Sri Lanka because of the Basel III requirements. 
The pandemic hit Sri Lanka quite suddenly. Sri Lanka being basically an export-oriented economy was dependent on a few sectors, especially the apparel industry, leisure industry and the migrant workers who work abroad, remitting a lot of money. These sectors are very vulnerable in any economy but in Sri Lanka they are absolutely important to us. 
The apparel industry alone generates about $5 billion of income. So when the economy went into lockdown, the members of the apparel industry could not export their products which had been produced here. In addition, they could not collect their dues of around $ 500 million from the products that had already been exported. Furthermore, the imports of raw materials that had been placed could not be brought in. 
Considering the leisure sector, within a day, everything came to a standstill. So as a result, a large amount of money could not be brought into Sri Lanka and could not be circulated in the economy. 

Q:  The responsibility of managing such a situation primarily sits with the finance sector; how was this situation faced?
The finance sector being a highly-regulated industry together with the President, Prime Minister and all relevant officers, through Central Bank, decided to give some kind of blood, immediate blood, to the economy. They did this by providing liquid support, in the form of moratoriums. They gave working capital loans which are absolutely important. 
Furthermore, there are certain technical things that happen in the financial industry, because every commercial bank is required to keep a percentage of your fixed deposit with the Central Bank. So say for instance that it was 6%, if you take a Rs. 100 deposit, of the Rs. 100 you have to keep Rs. 6 with the Central Bank where the banker doesn’t get any income by way of interest for that deposit. It’s interest free. So, the Central Bank first released 2%. In other words, this is called SRR – Statutory Reserve Ratio. Later they released another 2%, thereby ensuring cash flow within the economy. 
Secondly, the moratoriums meant that for the next six months customers had no need to worry about loan and credit card repayments. So by doing that everybody was very comfortable with having liquidity in their hands. This facility was given to all across the board, whether corporate or private sector and all individuals. 

Q:  People are not making money but want loans that they might not be able to repay, which puts banks at risk. In your opinion, did all banks, including private banks, actually adhere to these stipulations? Were the people actually happy with it and, if not, why?
People’s Bank being a State-owned bank has a different focus because its shareholder is the State. Alternatively, if you take a private bank, its shareholder is not the State. While the Government has a stake of about 30-35% in most of the private commercial banks, the remainder is held by outsiders, and their expectation is different. What they expect is mainly dividends and increase in value per share. Where State banks are concerned, the Government categorically stated that customer needs have to come first. 
Obviously there are certain differences when comparing State banks and private banks because State banks went pell-mell and gave all the comforts from day one. On the other hand, private banks have to draw a very thin line between shareholder expectations and customer expectations. So there is a kind of clash between these two. Therefore, some of the banks could not immediately get on board with this as they had many factors to consider. 
In the meantime, at this moment, as bankers, we need to understand the country’s balance sheet, not individual balance sheets. At the end of the day, we need to have customers to sustain. Also we don’t have large amounts of capital with us because we get depositors’ money, which we lend. In every bank, their shareholders would have contributed only 10% of the capital. The 90% comes from depositors. Therefore, everyone needs to understand that there is a huge risk and the bankers have to make sure that we pay our depositors back on time. 

Q:  During the pandemic there were instances where people were not allowed to withdraw their Fixed Deposits before maturity, but on the positive side people were granted loan extensions. In your perspective, what is the objective of the Government and the finance sector in adopting this stance? Is there a strategy behind this? Is it towards something positive? 
People’s Bank, being the bank of the people, has never restricted anybody from withdrawing money. If you have a deposit and have entered into a certain term, whether it is one month or three months or one year, once it has matured, you can surrender your certificate and get the deposit back, including your accumulated interest. In the event that you want to withdraw that prematurely, still there is a possibility. 
There are, however, two types of institutions in the market; ones that are registered with the Central Bank and those that operate below the radar. The latter are basically not registered with the Central Bank, which is something people should be concerned about. There is no question about not paying your deposits and things like that. There may be some issues, but generally, across the board, all the banks even financial companies in this country honoured their payment. 

Q:  How was the process during the pandemic?‍
 If there were requests for advances, I believe certain limitations came into play. But where the deposits are concerned, it’s a prime responsibility of a banker or a financial institution to make sure that you get paid whenever it has matured or even before. 
If you want to develop the economy of any country, you need to have a very low interest regime. Sri Lanka has been having 16%, 20% to 25% interest rates for loans. You simply can’t sustain because when you’re going to take a loan at the rate you have to include that interest cost into the product or service that you provide. But Sri Lanka also looks at exports, at overseas markets. So can you compete in the export market? That is where the present Government seriously thought about having the single digit interest rate. Therefore, at present banks have multiple loan schemes now less than 10% through the ‘Saubhagya Dekma’ program – to have a single digit regime.

Q: Is maintaining a single digit rate a factor in a normal situation or is it especially for rebuilding after a pandemic?
 There is a perception even among bankers that they need to have the highest interest rate, but now everyone has brought it down to around 10% or less than 10% or it could be maximum 11%. Therefore, this will continue irrespective of the pandemic. The important thing is that whoever is going to borrow funds will have a varying concession rate where the cost of production of your product or your services will be very competitive. 
There is a difference between the interest rates in a loan and a deposit. We also know that there is a large group of people who have already contributed to the country and are now retired. Most of them don’t have any other income, except for the interest from their savings. This interest is therefore crucial for them, especially for expenses like medicine. But we should also understand that we have to support the industries to be competitive in the market, especially at present, so that we can also reduce the cost of living. 
In addition, we should also change our lifestyle, we have to seek local products whenever we can. We need to promote local industries, which will definitely have an impact on the cost of living. Agencies like the Consumer Affairs Authority will have to monitor if the incentive given by banks is given to the customers in return by businesses, by reducing their cost of production or cost of service.

Q:  As much as all this is promising, we see the smaller industries, micro- or medium-scale industries, still struggling. What is the way forward for them from the banking perspective? 
If we look at SMEs, People’s Bank introduced several loan schemes, like ‘Aswenna,’ with low interest rates. We give it to agriculture, poultry and fisheries sectors. We gave moratoriums to bus owners, because they had no income during lockdown. 
But at the same time, customers also should understand how the banking process works. A lot of people have the impression that if they go to the bank, they are entitled to receive what they ask for. However, if you have defaulted any of your loans, if you have not seen your banker for so many months, then the first impression of the banker towards you will be very different. The right kind of engagement and interaction with your banker is absolutely important. 

Q:  We have previously discussed the IDB’s role in getting this sector groomed and partnering with People’s Bank. ‘Restart Sri Lanka’ by SLIM is also focusing its efforts into restarting SMEs and helping them build up. So do you see your partnership with IDB and ‘Restart Sri Lanka’ in moving forward?
 Up until now, Government institutions have been working in silos. Now there is a greater collaboration – IDB, People’s Bank and ‘Restart Sri Lanka’. IDB is going to provide everything to the prospective investor; all their feasibility studies, project reports and so on, free of charge. With that, they will come to the bank and we will look at the documents and within a few days they can extend the facility. So ‘Restart Sri Lanka’ will also come and help with facilitation. This is the way forward – all industries coming together and working with synergy.

Funds to be raised via private placement in line with CB requirements 
Core capital expected to rise to Rs. 3 b after issuance

Kanrich Finance Ltd. (KFL) will raise Rs. 2 billion capital through a private placement in order to fulfil the core capital requirement by year end as stipulated by the Central Bank, the organisation said in a statement yesterday.  
The Central Bank periodically stipulates the minimum core capital financial institutions need to maintain and accordingly the minimum core capital that a registered finance company should maintain after 1 January 2021 is Rs. 2 billion. 
Last week, the Central Bank granted approval to Kanrich Finance Ltd. to issue ordinary voting shares and non-redeemable, non-cumulative preference shares. The private placement plans to raise Rs. 1 billion in ordinary shares and a further Rs. 1 billion in preference shares, which together will bring the core capital close to Rs. 3 billion. 
Incorporated in 1971, Kanrich Finance was re-launched in 2010 and within a period of six years the company managed to increase its asset base from Rs. 600 million to Rs. 12 billion and expanded a single location company into a finance company with 36 branches and over 1,000 employees.
The company was also awarded as the ‘Fastest Growing & Emerging Finance Company’ and ‘The Best Micro Finance Service Provider’ in Sri Lanka during the Financial Years 2014/2015/2016 consecutively at the Global Banking & Finance Review Awards. 
The company has a diversified lending portfolio comprising of leasing, micro leasing, micro finance, pawning and consumer loans. Currently the company is concentrating mainly on lending in pawning and will start diversifying again once the share issue is complete.
Stepping into its 50th year, the company will complete the share issue before the end of the year and is hopeful that the current economic climate would also improve by then and help the company on its growth path.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic having undoubtedly affected the whole nation, Bimputh Finance said it is thankful to the authorities, for the guidance and the current initiatives undertaken by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, assistance by our bankers, customers and all other stakeholders during these challenging times.
Though the pandemic has affected Bimputh Finance’s bottom line due to cash inflows and loss of interest income, understanding clients’ predicaments, to-date the company has assisted around 40,000 customers negatively affected by the challenging economic downturn by providing a moratorium on their loans.
“Over the years, having maintained a sustainable and diversified business ready to withstand the headwinds in the sector, backed by ongoing prudent financial management, an agile mindset and the unrelenting drive of our people, we were able to respond quickly to correct our course and mitigate some of the impact of COVID-19 on our performance. It bears testament to the resilience and financial health of our organisation,” said Bimputh Finance CEO P. Niranjan. 
The statement also said Bimputh Finance’s capital infusion plan to meet the regulatory requirement is currently under consideration by the Central Bank.

The post-COVID-19 world has greatly amplified unsustainable and irresponsible revenue generation by corporates being mainly responsible for the numerous issues and challenges faced by society, increasing economic inequality, greater widening of the gap between the rich and poor, and environmental degradation – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara
 
Redefining global markets 
We are living in a time, globally markets are redefined, re-assessed, and the viability of business sustainability and business continuity based on the old models that existed prior to COVID-19. 
Almost for two decades global business entities carried on regardless with their agenda. Corporate business dashboards, KPIs were significantly tilted towards the aggressive profit maximisation with a single focus on the top line and the bottom line. 

Wider stakeholder ROI
In a dynamically strong and an evolving and democratic society there has to be room for the inflow of private capital to nurture innovation, creativity and solutions to resolve the social issues, challenges and demands of the society. 
However this needs to be reflected on business models and frameworks where all the stakeholders should receive the benefit of usage of the capital investment. In essence, the benefits of the return on investment (ROI) should be more inclusive to cover all the stakeholders for their contribution, engagement, and the resource utilisation. 

Failure of the triple bottom-line approach 
The concept of triple bottom line, the Planet, People, Profit and the Corporate Social Responsibility CSR and all the initiatives and programs used by the global and local corporates and business leaders merely showcase as a feather in their business cap and not as a part of their business DNA. That’s the reason the world has seen enough and more demonstration of corporate greed at the exploitation of the other key stakeholders. 
The post-COVID-19 world has greatly amplified unsustainable and irresponsible revenue generation by the corporates being mainly responsible for the numerous issues and challenges faced by society, increasing economic inequality, greater widening of the gap between the rich and poor, and environmental degradation, etc.

Profit to the progress of the planet and the people
All business entities, from global corporate giants and local business conglomerates to SMEs, are needed to recognise they are part of the bigger surface that their businesses are standing on, and if the surface becoming weak there is no possibility they can stand strongly on their own. 
Therefore any business entity needs to be aware of there are number of key equal stakeholders that are energising and impacting the business entity – the shareholders that will let their private capital flow, the employees that will be the driving force of the business, the customers who pay value to the purchase of the solutions presented by the businesses, and the society and the fabric of the environment that any businesses stands on. 

It is very clear that COVID-19 has now thrown all to the deep end, we need to go beyond approach of triple bottom line, planet, people, profit to a quadruple bottom line to articulate and mandate the business corporate to work on the fourth P which is the Progress of the planet and the people. 
Business corporates need to have the conviction that unless the profit they make out of the planet and the people is now ploughed back to the Progress of the planet and the people, there is no business sustainability and continuity. 

Purpose of profit and profit with a purpose
Profit with a purpose has much wider and greater inclusivity showcase that the profit generated is now benefitting and impacting all stakeholders. The leadership of the business entities at the very outset lays the framework for KPI that will translate to show case the profit with a purpose. 
Return on Investment (ROI) for each of the stakeholders, the shareholders, employees, customers, society and the planet should be rightfully enshrined and ensure no stakeholder is exploited and sacrificed for the benefit of the other. 

Transcending to create a socially impactful entrepreneur ecosystem
Prior to COVID 19, most of business conglomerates globally and locally and numerous other business entities greatly focused and worked on the top line and the bottom line. But when COVID-19 hit, except for some of the leading tech and tech-retail giants, in all industry sectors, from airline, to travel, hospitality, banking and finance and many other business and industry sectors were affected. They are no longer advocating the top line and the bottom line but the lifeline to survive, sustain and surge ahead. 
In a living ecosystem there is the existence of species of different shapes and sizes, from nano, micro, small and medium, big and large, which are interdependent, integrated and interwoven, and when one is affected, all get impacted. The COVID-19 lockdown first affected the informal sector of nano and micro entrepreneurs and thereafter the rest, SMEs and large corporates.
It is now very evident without the lifeline running throughout the fabric of the ecosystem touching entrepreneurs from nano to micro to SME to large and corporate, strategising on a top line and the bottom line is not sustainable. Further, absolute conviction of the business entities and corporates that if the profit generated by using the planet and the people is not ploughed back to the progress of planet and the people, there is no sustainability.
Profit with a Purpose (PwP) for responsible business sustainability and continuity will transcend businesses and entrepreneurs to more responsible to enhance, empower and enrich the society economically, of which they are an integral part.

IFC’s pandemic response is focused on reaching the most vulnerable people in developing countries. Of the $ 8 billion in IFC COVID-19 fast-track financing approved by the IFC Board in March 2020, $ 4 billion has been committed to date, of which close to half is expected to benefit people in the poorest countries and fragile states, with the remainder helping to support the fight against COVID-19 across other developing countries and emerging markets.
 “Supporting the private sector will be crucial to helping developing countries achieve an inclusive, sustainable and resilient recovery and stem the current rise in extreme poverty,” said World Bank Group President David Malpass. “Our goal with IFC’s fast-track COVID-19 facility is to provide needed liquidity for corporate and financial institution clients, which will provide working capital, support jobs and facilitate trade.” 
IFC’s Board in March approved $ 8 billion in financing to help companies affected by the outbreak. IFC, the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets, has since fully deployed the $ 2 billion allocated under the trade-finance envelope of the fast-track facility. This support is helping client financial institutions keep liquidity flowing to businesses that depend on trade, especially micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), a major source of employment. 
“IFC’s fast-track COVID-19 facility was designed to provide immediate liquidity to our financial institutions and real sector clients to preserve jobs and prevent short-term damage,” said Stephanie von Friedeburg, Interim Managing Director, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of IFC. “By supporting private sector clients and interventions, we are hoping in the longer term to help reignite economic growth, paving the way for a better, more resilient and sustainable future once COVID-19 recedes.”  
IFC has committed an additional $ 2 billion under the facility, benefiting every region in which IFC operates. This financing is being used for a range of purposes, from bolstering healthcare providers to helping the battered tourism sector and keeping viable businesses afloat, thus saving jobs. Another $ 623 million has been mobilised for these clients from private sector partners.
Additionally, the IDA Private Sector Window (PSW), a tool developed by the World Bank Group to catalyse private-sector investment in the world’s poorest countries, has provided $ 281 million in guarantees supporting trade-finance and working-capital loans to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in eligible countries since March. 
IFC’s response is part of the World Bank Group’s effort to take broad, fast action to help developing countries strengthen their pandemic response, increase disease monitoring and improve public-health interventions. The World Bank Group has the financial capacity to deploy $ 160 billion over the next 15 months, including a potential $ 47 billion from IFC in overall support for the private sector. 
Looking ahead, IFC will work with its partners to help restructure and recapitalize viable businesses and set the stage for an inclusive, sustainable and resilient recovery. In August, IFC also launched the $ 4 billion Global Health Platform, which is helping developing countries expand access to medical supplies such as masks, ventilators, test kits and, eventually, a COVID-19 vaccine.
Here are some examples of IFC projects committed under the fast-track financing facility with a focus on helping small to medium-sized businesses: 
In Uganda, IFC strengthened services to hundreds of thousands of hospital and clinic patients through a $ 4 million loan to International Medical Group.
In Nigeria, IFC helped SMEs across several sectors facing working-capital or trade-finance challenges with a combined $ 200 million loan to FCMB, Access and Zenith banks.In Egypt, IFC supported companies whose cash flows have been disrupted by COVID-19 through a $ 100 million loan to Commercial International Bank.
In Bangladesh, IFC supported Mymensingh Agro Limited, a company within the PRAN Group, to expand its capacity to manufacture affordable and quality food products with a $ 25 million investment.
In Vietnam, IFC offered relief to businesses, including more than 300 SMEs, by providing $ 75 million to the Phu My Hung Development Corporation.
In Ukraine, IFC helped a leading agricultural producer in Ukraine finance its working capital to limit potential input supply chain disruptions in meat production due to the pandemic, thereby supporting domestic food security.
In Brazil, IFC helped preserve jobs and lessen the economic shocks through a $ 100 million loan to Daycoval, a bank that will provide credit to SMEs, included women-owned businesses.

By Keasila Jayawardena

To be thrift is to use money or any other resource with care and prudence without leaving room for wastage. Many centuries ago, man learnt that saving can bring success. He used bee honey to preserve the hunted meat. When he invented fire, certain foods were kept under ashes for preservation. So, man made it a habit to save and preserve a fraction of his valuables and possessions for future use.
The Sri Lankan family in the past had an extensive number of members. The income level of the families as well as the country was generally low and the usage of money, banking facilities and the access to banking facilities were less popular when compared to the modern banking and financial industry. Yet the mothers of the traditional Sri Lankan society showed that we are not strangers to saving and thrift by keeping aside a handful of rice from the daily consumption.
Yet it appears that the modern society does not attach much value to such concepts and attitudes because most people today tend to choose only the short-term benefits. They are seemingly not reluctant to spend their entire income and it has become their ultimate desire to purchase many of the products that flow into the modern market as a result of the rapid development in science and technology. But what if you lose your job unexpectedly or you are taken to bed by a sudden illness? Your sophisticated equipment would not come to your assistance at such an emergency. We should prepare ourselves to tackle such difficulties sensibly with a plan always at hand. Any individual can achieve the financial platform needed to confront these challenges successfully making it a habit to save a portion of what is earned or received. The virtues of thrift and saving come into our assistance in achieving this purpose.  
We can practice these virtues during various occasions of our day-to-day life. For instance, we can prepare a list of the items to be purchased at the market prior to our visit and thereby avoid purchasing goods that we actually do not need or serve our purpose. This will result in a saving. Also, by switching off electric appliances when not in use and minimising the usage of the telephone, electricity and water, monthly bills could be reduced and save yet another portion of our income.
As such, mobilising more domestic funds is essential in gaining financial security as an individual and funding and fuelling the expected growth as a country. Heavily influenced by this understanding, Finance Minister of the United Front Government Dr. N.M. Perera always looked at economic management from a long-term perspective and thus pursued a policy of containing present consumption via practical austerity or ‘tightening the belt’. As one of his many efforts made towards domestic development National Savings Bank came into being on 16 March 1972 out of his unmatched vision of austerity and unstinted mission of promoting savings. Since Ceylon Savings Bank, established in 1832, was one the said four institutions, National Savings Bank boasts of a century-old saving legacy since its inception.   
“It is my fortune that I am the Minister of Finance in a society whose people are accustomed to austere lives. We always stress the need and the importance of austere living, and that the savings of the country should be properly mobilised and increased. Based on small amounts of money saved through the mechanism of the savings pass books, National Savings Bank has now entered the banking sector which comprises three prominent banks; and, that is a very good augury,” stated Dr. N.M. Perera in introducing the Bill for the establishment of the National Savings Bank in the Parliament. In accordance with his political philosophy Dr. Perera did not want to establish an ‘ordinary’ bank in Sri Lanka but a bank that contributes to the ‘promotion of savings among the people, particularly among those with limited means, and the profitable investment of savings so mobilised’.
National Savings Bank thus connected the past and the future of the savings culture by operating as a more potential and an effective avenue to direct the surplus amounts of money lying in all sorts of odd places, hidden or buried, towards the development process of the country. Since then the Bank often strived to be the most reliable and sought-after savings and investment solution through prompt response, innovative measures, trust, mutual respect and integrity. Millions of people of this country who have chosen NSB as their savings and banking partner confirm that the Bank has acted in line with its vision and the interests of its valued customers and all the other stakeholders thus far.
With the implementation of the ultimate vision of the Government, ‘Saubhagye Dekma’ (Vision of Prosperity), our country has reached an important juncture in its history with a host of opportunities in hand. Yet, with the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the economy and the living standards of the people of the country is at a stake and the Bank is striving to fulfil its duty of the hour by maintaining its operations and services without interruption in line with the Government’s effort of keeping the economy of the country resilient. 
The present circumstances, where many sectors of the society and the economy, including employment, production, businesses are in crisis, significantly indicates the importance and need of saving and thrift. With the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in the country, the Government has launched an agrarian project under the name, ‘Saubhagya Gewaththa’ (Garden of Prosperity) to give a helping hand to the people to encounter a probable food crisis that may erupt under the existing condition, by growing at least part of their daily needs: vegetables and fruits in their own garden. With the objective of cultivating the habit of saving through their own garden, National Savings Bank has initiated the promotion of this concept island wide in commemoration of the 93rd World Thrift Day on 31 October 2017. Under the program, 76,000 export quality mango and anoda plants were distributed among our customers. As the second phase of the project, 26,000 packets of vegetable seeds were distributed among our customers in commemoration of the 94th World Thrift Day on 31 October 2018.    
Primarily mandated with the task of inculcating the habit of saving among people, National Savings Bank always strives to ensure a saving for the people from many other aspects, in addition to offering a wide range of products and services to cater to their financial needs.

Sustainable Development Policy
As a measure in realising this effort, the Bank has developed a Sustainable Development Policy by selecting four Sustainable Development Goals out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals introduced by the United Nations Development Program. Accordingly, the Bank has taken measures to address the Goals of Good Health and Nutrition, Quality Education, Clean Water and Sanitation and Affordable Energy. 
The Bank has already initiated a project to address the Goal of Quality Education in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and a program will be conducted in 81 selected national schools island wide where the pass rate of the G.C.E O/L Examination 2017 in English is lower, to increase the same. 
Another program has been implemented to address the Goal of Good Health and Nutrition in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education, under which, it is aimed to improve the nutrition level and decrease the obesity of the children in 10 selected schools in the Colombo District.
Since transition to a low carbon economy has become a necessity due to the increasing climate changes and natural disasters banking practices that contribute to reduce negative environmental impact should be essentially followed. Understanding correctly that the conservation of the environment, natural resources and the entire earth is also a saving, we always make it a point to integrate various environmental policies and programs into our operations to help mitigate the climate changes, promote biodiversity and protect the biosphere. We have embraced green finance as the key to the future of sustainable development. In this endeavor, we promote green lending schemes through NSB Eco that supports middle-income households to invest in solar energy. Further, we have commenced converting our branch buildings to use renewable energy sources while adopting branch-wide practices in responsible consumption of all resources.     
To promote the habit of saving among the people, 31 October, every year was declared as World Thrift Day at the first International Thrift Congress and accordingly, today is the 96th World Thrift Day which is commemorated by all banks and financial institutions around the world. If you have still not enjoyed the amazing benefits of saving, you can set off today. We invite all Sri Lankans to save with the premiere savings bank and the safest bank in Sri Lanka, National Savings Bank and inherit a secured future.

Union Bank continued to focus on its prudent cost and portfolio management strategy to remain resilient amidst a volatile macro-economic landscape that prevailed through the third quarter of the year. 
The COVID-19 outbreak weakened the country outlook substantially and affected the overall business landscape of the country. Amidst a challenging economic landscape, the Average Prime Lending Rate (AWPLR) dropped by approximately 400bps YoY while the Treasury Bill rates continued on a downward trend during the period under review. In line with directives of the Central Bank, Union Bank implemented a downward revision of interest rates on its various lending products including credit cards. The Bank took measures to provide loans at concessionary rates for Working Capital requirements of SMEs and exporters by participating in the CBSL credit schemes including the Saubhagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility. 
In a backdrop where the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the economy, businesses and consumers continued to weigh down on the banking industry, the Bank focused on continuing the COVID-19 related benefits schemes granted to its customers in a bid to support their financial recovery while focusing on maintaining business operations in compliance with health safety guidelines set by health officials to ensure safety of staff, customers and other stakeholders. 
Amidst mounting challenges, Union Bank increased its liquidity buffers on a prudent basis and has been able to maintain a strong excess liquidity position. During the period under review average fixed deposits remained stable whereas average CASA ended at Rs. 23,805 million, with an increase of 18% over the comparative period.  As a consequence of the Bank’s policy to support its customers during these tough times and a decline in interest rates, its Net Interest Margin (NIM) declined from 3.8% to 3.3% over the comparative period. 
Late payment fee and other fee waivers provided in line with the CBSL guidelines aimed at supporting the customers affected by the pandemic, alongside a decline in economic activity, caused a reduction of the overall fee income by 25% over the comparative period. 
The Treasury performed notably within the period under review, recording impressive trading profit/capital gains with a significant YoY increase of 108%. Other Operating Income of the Bank increased on the back of exchange rate deflation during the said period. 
Amidst the challenging environment, the Operating Income of the Bank for the quarter was Rs. 1,692 million, and reduced by 3% over the comparative quarter. The Total Operating Expenses were prudently managed through bank-wide cost management initiatives and reduced by 5% QoQ to Rs. 941 million. Consequently, pre-impairment profits of the Bank were Rs. 751 million for the quarter and was similar to that of the comparative quarter. 
While the Bank’s actual credit losses were low, the Bank recorded significant provisions through management overlays to account for the deteriorating environment, leading to a 31% QoQ increase in impairment charges. The entire day one loss on account of COVID-19 moratoriums was recorded under the impairment charge as per the non-substantial modification method which is in line with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – 9 (SLFRS 9). 
Against this challenging macro-economic backdrop, the Bank recorded subdued Results from Operating Activities of Rs. 470 million a decline of 12% over the comparable quarter. The operating environment for the Bank’s subsidiaries, namely UB Finance and NAMAL was also very challenging. Due to a drop-in tax rates and prudent management of reserves, the Bank including its share of ownership in its subsidiaries was able to maintain its PAT at the comparative quarter levels. 
YTD Operating Income of the Bank was Rs. 4,643 million and was similar to that of the comparative period. The Total Operating Expenses were prudently managed through bank-wide cost management initiatives and reduced by 4% YoY to Rs. 2,855 million. Consequently, Pre-impairment profits of the Bank were Rs. 1,787 million for the period and indicated a 7% growth over the same period last year. While the Bank’s actual credit losses were low, the Bank recorded significant provisions through management overlays to account for the deteriorating environment, leading to a 59% increase in impairment charges over the comparative period. The entire day one loss on account of COVID-19 moratoriums was recorded under the impairment charge as per the non-substantial modification method which is in line with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – 9 (SLFRS 9). 
Against a continuously challenging macro-economic backdrop, the Bank recorded subdued Results from Operating Activities of Rs. 1,226 million YTD, a decline of 7% over the comparable period. The operating environment for the Bank’s subsidiaries, has also continued to be very challenging. Due to a drop-in tax rates and prudent management of reserves, the Bank including its share of ownership in its subsidiaries was able to increase its PAT by 3% YoY. Total comprehensive income for the Bank YTD was Rs. 812 million. 
Owing to external pressures and continuous deterioration of macro-economic conditions since March this year, the gross NPL ratio of the Bank was reported as 5.48% by end of the reporting period compared to 5.03% as of last year. The Bank’s prudent approaches towards managing portfolio quality proved favourable in containing NPLs even within a weakened economic landscape. 
Total assets of the Bank stood at Rs. 122,291 million as at 30 September. The Bank’s loans and receivables stood at Rs. 71,333 million YTD while the deposits base was Rs. 81,958 million and expanded by 7% during the period. 
The Bank continued to maintain its capital adequacy ratios well above the regulatory requirements and reported a robust Capital Adequacy with a Total Capital Ratio of 16.26% as at the reporting date. 
Union Bank’s robust liquidity position and stability were further affirmed by Fitch Ratings in the latest ratings release in 2020 which confirmed the current rating of the Bank. 
The Group consisting of the Bank and its two subsidiaries, UB Finance Company Ltd. and National Asset Management Ltd. reported a Profit before all taxes of Rs. 1,306 million for the period. 
The Profit after Tax of the Group in comparison to the corresponding period last year declined by 5%. Total assets of the Group were Rs. 129,008 million of which 95% was represented by the Bank. The Group maintained a healthy Core Capital Ratio of 16.41% as at the reporting date. 
During the period commencing from April 2020 to 30 September 2020, the Bank had approved debt moratoria under the CBSL recommended debt relief scheme providing extensions for repayment of capital and interest on loans granted. Loan facilities were granted with payment extensions providing relief to customers to navigate during these challenging times. Amongst the schemes that were considered for moratoria are Loans and Leases, Overdrafts, Pawning and Trade Finance facilities. 
Union Bank’s Corporate Banking customers were proactively approached with customised financial solutions to help stabilise their strategic redirections post-lockdown. Union Bank’s SME Banking segment focused its support towards customers that were affected by the pandemic lockdown, supporting to re-ignite their businesses and livelihoods while channelling the CBSL backed funding schemes to enable SME business revival in-line with the national vision for economic recovery.
During the period under review, the Bank has granted Rs. 1.3 billion worth of working capital loans under Central Bank’s ‘Saubhagya’ concessionary credit scheme to SMEs in diverse sectors that were adversely affected by the pandemic. As part of its relief efforts for affected customers, around 58% of the SME portfolio value had been accommodated under different moratorium schemes. These measures have substantially helped affected entrepreneurs to re-strategise and recommence business activities amidst subdued economic conditions. 
Union Bank BizDirect continued to offer the Bank’s Corporate and SME customers the much-needed liquidity management efficiency while facilitating prudent and convenient cash management expertise to maximise on liquid positions of their companies during these challenging times. Due to a growing inclination for digital solutions over traditional banking methods, many new customers were on-boarded for Union Bank BizDirect in both Corporate and SME segments during the period under review. 
Retail banking business growth was led by CASA acquisition, deposit mobilisation and Credit Cards portfolio expansion. The Bank continued to offer greater value to its Cardholders through focused lifestyle offers that included discounts on hotel stays, dining and shopping along with 0% interest instalment plans. Union Bank’s digital banking channels continued to provide added convenience to customers by facilitating a contact-free and secure banking experience. 
In-line with health authority guidelines, the Bank prioritised its focus on the implementation of comprehensive measures to ensure the safety of customers and staff, resulting in stringent hygiene and safety practices across the branch network and Head Office premises. Convenient access was made available for customers to reach the Bank’s ATM network, online/mobile banking platforms and the 24-hour contact centre, thus enabling a safe and secure banking experience. 
Commenting on the performance, Union Bank Director/Chief Executive Officer Indrajit Wickramasinghe said, “We have placed a steady focus on maintaining a healthy liquidity position while engaging with our customers to provide them with the necessary impetus to navigate through these difficult times. The third quarter results display the resilience of Union Bank against a challenging landscape. As we steer with prudence and continuously adjust our sails to withstand the extreme volatilities which have become the new-norm in the current times, we hope to continue the engagement with customers and provide tailored financial solutions that would better-suit their unique financial needs and challenges while ensuring the well-being of our staff and customers at all times. Maintaining a healthy liquid position, driving profitability and prudent portfolio growth will be key focus areas of the Bank during the last lap of this year.”

HNB Deputy General Manager – Wholesale Banking Group, DamithPallewatte

 




HNB has always been at the forefront of altering the dynamics of the banking industry and leveraging technology to meet the changing needs of an increasingly sophisticated, digitally savvy customer. At the beginning of 2020, HNB revamped the organizational structure to support its on-going transformation programme - its main business lines were integrated into two broad verticals, Retail and Wholesale Banking, with the express goal of enabling greater agility and innovation and also living up to its brand promise of providing customer convenience by being a partner in progress. At the leading edge of these transformations is HNB’s efforts to better serve Large and Emerging Corporates and Institutional Clients through, its Wholesale Banking Group(WBG).
HNB now aims to provide an unmatched value proposition delivered via a one-stop service concept specifically catered to top tier wholesale banking clients via a model that is practiced by the world’s leading international banks, but adapted with a local flavor that identifies with the pulse of the Sri Lankan market. HNB DGM – Wholesale Banking Group, Damith Pallewatte, shared some insights from the bank’s ongoing transformation, the implications of current economic conditions and foresights on embracing a wholesale banking proposition. Following are excerpts:

Q: What are some of the challenges associated with driving transformational banking initiatives during a pandemic?
Transformation has been the central theme emerging from the pandemic. COVID19 is the most disruptive global pandemic I have seen in my career so I don’t believe that any bank will be able to emerge from this period unscathed – given that ours is an industry which is integrally connected to all parts of the economy. During the pandemic, the industry was battered by high costs of unanticipated changes to business and operating models apart from other escalating routine costs. Low interest rates are also likely to add further pressure to yields and margins.
Customers demanded banks to offer more personalized advice in the prevailing VUCA environment while a fast-growing array of FinTechs continue to raise the baseline for digital service and delivery. So it was no easy task to drive transformation whilst this shift was on. Nevertheless, we took it as a blessing in disguise to optimize our operating model.
We have seen almost 45-50% of corporate & Institutional clientele amounting to over Rs. 150 billion undergoing moratoriums and at times getting a life line through relief packages. This support was primarily extended to customers to help them recommence business operations just a few weeks into the pandemic by providing working capital facilities and deferring repayment plans through moratoriums. Our employees, also had to change their usual relationship management strategy and sharpen their skills including adopting “Working from Home” (WFH) practices and spending higher than usual time with customers to help them ride through this pandemic.
 As a result of these efforts, many of our customers have been able to strengthen their position and continue business, albeit at 60-70% of pre-COVID levels within a short period since the lock- down was lifted. We will continue to work with these businesses to help them to stay resilient during challenging times. We have gone beyond CBSL mandated credit relief schemes to support our businesses through post-lockdown economic recovery. HNB on its own has launched a Rs. 5 billion subsidized loan scheme targeted especially towards HNB’s SMEs and Micro businesses. Moving forward, we will continue to engage with businesses more intimately to guide them through this ‘new normal’.
While HNB is predominantly seen as a Retail and SME player in the market, the creation of the Wholesale Banking Group is part of a more aggressive strategy to capture market segments which had previously been the domain of international banking players.
Given HNB’s status as a Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) we always strive to be an example and lead from the front. HNB now offers a more viable Sri Lankan alternative to large corporates, MNCs, and institutional clients given that we can offer a full spectrum, value proposition through Wholesale Banking covering Conventional financing, Corporate banking, Trade Finance, Forex and other Treasury related services, together with Transactional Banking, Custody & Trustee Services, Fund Management, alternate investment products and Islamic Banking as progressive products/services. In fact, HNB is the strongest financial powerhouse in the industry, having a group and segment structure with a presence in investment banking, insurance and commercial banking to provide a complete range of solutions.

Q:  What potential do you see for Sri Lanka’s economic recovery?
Despite unprecedented challenges brought about by the COVID19 pandemic that pushed the economy towards a contraction, Sri Lanka was very successful in containing the first wave of infections and post lifting lockdown we have been on a broadly V-shaped economic recovery trajectory. Through many of the measures described previously, the banking community played an immeasurable role in facilitating such resilience by aligning them with that of the country’s requirements, even at significant costs to the industry.
In view of the recent developments of a second wave, which to a certain extent disrupted the upward momentum of economic activities, recovery has become more elusive. We anticipate a modest credit growth during the year. The end of the moratorium period this September will put lots of businesses under tremendous pressure and the banking industry is likely to witness a spike in NPLs towards the end of 2020, if such instances are not managed clinically.
Coupled with increased impairment provisions for credit losses under SLFRS9 and a low interest rate regime in operation that place margins under severe pressure, the profitability of the banking sector will undoubtedly be adversely affected. However, capital buffers built over the last few years with CBSLs prudent introduction of adequate capital buffer requirements through advanced
 BASEL guidelines, will still ensure that banks remain strongly capitalized to absorb shocks and support the country’s course towards accelerated economic growth.
Certain industries such as Travel & Tourism are unlikely to bounce back any time before the second half of 2021, which will severely impact industries dependent upon tourism too. Whilst this stands against a swift recovery, on the brighter side, there is enormous potential on the sectors such as Agriculture and manufacturing for both local and export markets. The economic recovery will, to a larger extent, dependent on how we focus on these potential growth sectors.

Q:  How has HNB’s business model evolved to face these challenges?
Given the profound changes sweeping the banking landscape, we must question traditional assumptions to derive a greater competitive advantage at every level of the business. This was very much the rationale underlying HNB’s ongoing transformation, which began prior to the pandemic.
Our goal was to simplify processes in order to deliver superior value through product, service, and geographic leadership – and in the process, open up powerful new avenues of growth. We also focused extensively on identifying high-value opportunities leveraged from our existing client relationships, competitive standing, and healthy balance sheet so that we could defend every differentiation we create while rationalizing our business in a focused manner to respond to client needs.
Relationship managers, investment bankers, salespeople, and traders have long served as the primary owners of the wholesale banking client relationship — and the conduit for all other banking services. While this talent remains crucial, we believe client service will no longer be a commercial activity that is confined to the front office. With personalization at scale becoming increasingly important, we combined the strengths of our product, marketing, and back-office resources in crafting HNBs philosophy to launch  the Wholesale Banking Group.
Accordingly, our strong international trade franchise – which supports a notable share of the nation’s international trade together with our robust treasury operations with active presence in forex market operations and fixed income securities - are managed within the consolidated structure of the WBG. This revised structure will also create entirely new synergistic opportunities for the bank and its clients.
We have also built up a progressive Transactional Banking proposition within the wholesale Banking Group which will serve as a formidable game changer moving forward. Similarly, HNB has also been nurturing home grown Custodian Services for the last 5 years to such an extent that today, we have captured well in excess of 50% of the market share. All these units have won international accolades proving their efficacy, value proposition and positive impact on clients’ businesses. We have also built an internationally acclaimed Islamic Banking Proposition for corporates that seek Sharia compliant Islamic Banking products.
 HNB’s illustrious track record in project financing has earned a reputation for being lead financier for mega projects, delivering on the promise of responsible and sustainable banking through a well governed Environmental and Social Management framework (ESMS). . We have disbursed in excess of LKR 150 Bn as project funding powering the nations development agenda over the last decade which signify HNBs contribution. Recognizing the greater opportunities for risk sharing in the market, we are also keen to step up our presence in the arena of syndications banking over the trust we have built through our project finance capabilities. Further, leveraging capabilities of our full service investment bank, Acuity Partners, we will actively facilitate our WBG clients to raise debt and equity, an option we will offer beyond conventional banking.
With the creation of WBG, we are providing an opportunity for large corporate and institutional clients to get on board through multiple channels and still enjoy a seamless service to meet their every financial need. For clients, this translates into unprecedented flexibility in choosing the services they require.
Here too, the human element is critical for success, and we have invested significantly in training Corporate Relationship Managers to indulge in deeper and more productive conversations with clients and actively advise them on business and financial offerings beyond the traditional Corporate Credit Facility Package. Through WBG proposition, we are also fully aligned to support envisaged government growth plans for capital market activities as well.
A new and exciting aspect of the WBG is our revamped ability to serve mature SMEs who can be guided to become Sri Lanka’s next corporate powerhouses. To this end, we created the “Emerging Corporates” vertical within WBG to serve their immediate financial needs and facilitate collaboration with larger counterparts locally and overseas. Currently we nurture 300+ such Emerging Corporate relationships mainly in and around Western Province with plans underway to expand into key locations across Sri Lanka in 2021.

Q:  Digitization and customer expectations are raising the stakes. What are HNB’s plans on this specially with in WBG?
We at HNB understand that Wholesale Banking customers are also feeling the effects of a fast- changing marketplace. Whilst individuals within those corporates can adopt innovative retail technologies mainly on smart phones, corporates need solutions that are different to that of retail banking. Effectively managing liquidity and risk requires treasurers and finance teams of corporate and institutional clients to look across the banking book; anticipate the impact of rates, currencies, and other variables; and take preemptive action. Treasurers want a digital and frictionless experience to manage day-to-day transactions, cash flow, and liquidity as well as a trusted business advisor that can advise them on long-term strategic business and financial issues.
 Giving due recognition for this reality, HNB has already invested to migrate its existing Payment and Cash Management system on to a fully-fledged state of the art Transaction Banking system which would enable collections, payments, management of liquidity etc. It would also automate payment of staff salaries, supply chain and statutory payments such as EPF/Customs Duty etc… giving corporates the complete peace of mind to focus on business growth. This new system will be rolled out during the 2H of 2021.
We have also planned to implement an interactive Trade Platform where our corporates will be provided the comfort of carrying out their international trade transactions securely from the comfort of their offices. We believe our on-line treasury trading platform too will help our corporates. This is the next two year digital journey we have planned out for WBG clients.

Q:  What is your outlook for future and HNB’s readiness?
The outlook will profoundly depend on how soon the pandemic can be contained and full scale economic activities resumed in the “new normal”. The IMF has predicted an economic contraction of 4.6% during 2020 in its latest prediction. While this scenario is more challenging than those Sri Lanka has experienced in the past, especially given the fact that most of the countries are globally affected and are in a less likely position to offer support, we are confident that we will come out of this stronger.
At the same time, HNB has always been a strong supporter of local industries and a forerunner in the SME space over the last few decades. We understand the different needs of different businesses and fully acknowledge that some businesses may take longer than others to revive. Hence our support to businesses too will be customized accordingly. We believe, that with the range of new opportunities and services offered by HNB, prospective customers will benefit taking their business to the next level.
As a bank with a 132 year old history fully aligned with the Sri Lankan economy and its development and one that has partnered the progress of several generations of Sri Lankans, we look forward to the opportunities in post COVID Sri Lanka with confidence. The transformation journey we embrace will no doubt help to re-energize ourselves and help HNB become future ready to become the beacon in Sri Lanka’s financial services industry.

ICRA Lanka Ltd., has assigned a rating of [SL]AA(hyb) with Stable outlook for the proposed Rs. 5 billion Basel III Compliant, Unlisted, Rated, Unsecured, Subordinated, Perpetual, Additional Tier I Capital Bond Programme of National Savings Bank (NSB). 
The letters ‘hyb’ in parenthesis suffixed to a rating symbol stand for ‘hybrid’, indicating that the rated instrument is a hybrid subordinated instrument with equity-like loss-absorption features, which may translate into higher levels of rating transition and loss severity vis-à-vis conventional debt instruments.
ICRA Lanka has an issuer rating outstanding of [SL]AAA (pronounced SL triple A) with Stable outlook for the bank. ICRA Lanka also has an issue rating of [SL]AAA (pronounced SL triple A) with Stable outlook outstanding for the Rs. 20,000 million senior, unlisted, unsecured, redeemable debenture programme and an issue rating of [SL]AA+ (pronounced SL double A plus) with Stable outlook for the Rs. 6,000 million subordinated, unsecured, redeemable debenture programme of NSB.  
The rated Basel III compliant Tier I bond programme (Additional Tier I or AT-I bonds) has the following loss-absorption features that make them riskier:
Coupon payments are non-cumulative and discretionary, and the bank has the full discretion at all times to cancel coupon payments. Cancellation of discretionary payments shall not be an event of default.  
Coupon can be paid out of the current year profits. However, if the current year’s profit is not sufficient, or, if the payment of coupon is likely to result in a loss, the coupon payment can be done through reserves and surpluses created through appropriation of profits[1]. However, the coupon payment is subject to the bank meeting the minimum regulatory requirements for CET I, Tier I and total capital ratios (including capital conservation buffer, CCB) at all times as prescribed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka under the Basel III regulations.
These Tier I bonds are expected to absorb losses through the write-down mechanism at the objective pre-specified trigger point. The trigger point event is the earlier of; a decision that a write-down, without which the bank would become non-viable, is necessary, as determined by the Monetary Board; and the decision to make a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, without which the bank would have become non-viable, as determined by the Monetary Board.
Given the above distinguishing features of the Tier I bonds, ICRA Lanka has assigned a one notch lower rating to these bonds compared to the rating of subordinated debentures. The distributable reserves[2], that can be used for servicing the coupon in case of inadequate profits or a loss during the year, stood at a comfortable 8.6% of the risk-weighted assets (RWAs) as on 30 June as compared to 9.19% as on 31 March. The rating of the Tier I bonds continues to be supported by NSB’s adequate capital profile (Capital Adequacy Ratio: 13.25%; Tier 1 ratio: 10.96% as on 30 June), which is likely to remain comfortable, given its low risk investment mandated by the NSB Act and healthy lending profile. The bank is mandated to invest a minimum 60% of the total deposits in government securities which attracts zero risk weight and supports its capital profile. The rating on the Basel III compliant Tier I bonds also factors in the bank’s muted profitability indicators, given the uncertainty regarding the asset quality amid the pandemic-induced stress on the same. However, the same is expected to be absorbed through NSB’s strong operating profits, the buffer in the existing capital levels and the sizeable distributable reserves for servicing the Tier I bonds.
The ratings of the bank take note of the 100% Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) ownership, which provides a strong likelihood of sovereign support, and the 100% explicit guarantee provided by the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) for the money deposited with the bank and the interest thereof through the National Savings Bank Act (NSB Act). The ratings factor in the low-risk investment portfolio, healthy lending portfolio and the adequate capital profile. The bank’s investment portfolio is characterised by low risk, with NSB mandated to invest a minimum of 60% of the total deposits in government securities; as in June, 62.58% of the deposits were in government securities.
NSB’s asset quality remains better as compared to Licensed Specialised Bank (LSB) average with a GNPA ratio of 2.34% as in June, lower than the LSB segment’s GNPA ratio of 7.08% and system average of 5.43% for the same period. The quality of the lending portfolio is driven by zero Gross NPAs on its exposure to GoSL, State-owned Entities (“SOE”) and Corporate segments which accounted for 34% of the lending portfolio in Jun and 3.51% gross NPA in the retail portfolio (66% of the lending portfolio) as of June compared to 2.52% in March. NSB’s BASEL III complied capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stood at 13.25% (Common Equity Tier I and Tier-I capital ratios at 10.96%) as compared to regulatory requirement of 12.00% (Common Equity Tier I ratio at 4.00% and Tier-I capital ratio at 8.00%) as of June. Further, in December 2019, CBSL reclassified NSB as a Non-Domestic-Systemically Important Bank (“Non -DSIB”) based on its new criteria for this assessment. As a result, NSB’s regulatory capital requirement in terms of Tier I capital reduced to 8.50%[3] from 10% earlier. ICRA Lanka notes that a reduction in regulatory capital requirement would reduce the pressure of securing external capital in the medium term. Going forward, continuous maintenance of adequate buffers (at least 1%) over and above the minimum capitalisation requirements (Tier-I plus CCB and CAR) would be critical for the sustenance of the current rating.
ICRA Lanka believes that NSB will continue to benefit from Government support considering its position as the largest licensed specialised bank in Sri Lanka, which also provides vital funding support to GoSL as per the NSB Act. The outlook may be revised to ‘negative’ in case of a steady shortfall in NSB’s capital buffers over the regulatory requirements as compared to ICRA Lanka’s expectations, or significant weakening in the profitability and asset quality indicators.

 An electronic board shows currency exchange rates in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil February 19, 2020 - Reuters

LONDON (Reuters): Dollar-denominated debt in emerging markets has risen past $4 trillion for the first time following a surge in issuance during the COVID-19 crisis, data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has shown.
The central bank umbrella group said a 14% jump in debt issuance during the April to June second quarter had driven a 7% year-on-year increase in broader dollar-denominated credit.
Dollar borrowing costs have fallen since the Federal Reserve slashed its interest rates to almost zero this year, but emerging markets are often warned of the “original sin” of being unable to repay dollar debt when their own currencies fall.
Consistent with the past few quarters, credit to Africa and the Middle East registered the highest growth rate at 14%, the BIS said, driven by countries in the Middle East.
Emerging Asia-Pacific and Latin America saw 9% and 5% respective year-on-year increases. In contrast, emerging Europe saw a 5% fall, extending the decline seen over the past six years as euro-denominated credit has become more important for the region.
Outstanding euro-denominated credit in emerging Europe, which includes countries such as Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, surpassed dollar credit in terms of the overall amount earlier this year.

Hong Kong/London (Reuters): HSBC Holdings PLC on Tuesday signalled it would embark on a pandemic-induced overhaul of its business model, seeking to flip its main source of income from interest rate to fee-based businesses.
Reporting a 35% tumble in quarterly profit, Europe’s largest bank also accelerated plans to shrink in size, targeted deeper cost cuts, and said it will resume conservative dividend payments when able.
The planned business model changes mark one of the biggest shifts in strategy to date from HSBC, which has long touted its ability to generate interest income from its more than $1.5 trillion in customer deposits.
But with interest rates worldwide now rock bottom and even turning negative, the bank is struggling to charge more for loans to borrowers than it pays out to depositors and it warned net interest income would remain under pressure.
Earlier this year the bank announced it would merge its wealth and personal banking business in a bid to cross-sell more lucrative products across a wider section of its huge customer base.
Now the bank is signalling it may go further and start charging for much more basic products such as standard current accounts that customers in some markets such as Britain expect to be free.
It will also look at how it can bring in more fee income from corporate customers, having done well helping clients raise money through bond and equity financing during the COVID-19 crisis.
“We will have to look at charging for basic banking services in some markets, because a large number of our customers in this environment will be losing us money,” Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told Reuters.
That could prove a tough pill to swallow in some markets, industry experts said.
“It will need to be done carefully to not damage the trust of the brand or get customers to switch, especially in countries where competitors offer the service for no charge,” said Sudeepto Mukherjee, senior vice president, financial services, at consulting firm Publicis Sapient.
The bank said it would set out further details on increasing fee income when it reports full-year results in February.
The announcement of the restructuring plans helped HSBC shares climb more than 6.5%, although they have still lost nearly half their value year to date.
Underscoring its challenges, the bank’s third-quarter revenue fell to $11.9 billion, down 11% from a year earlier.
Its 35% slide in pretax profit to $3.1 billion beat a consensus estimate of $2.07 billion as HSBC flagged an easing in bad loan provisions.
“While the outlook for impairments still remains highly uncertain... HSBC delivered strong third-quarter results in overall terms and the upbeat outlook commentary in terms of strategy execution is reassuring,” said John Cronin, an analyst at Dublin-based brokerage Goodbody.
HSBC now expects losses from bad loans to be at the lower end of the $8-$13 billion range it set out earlier this year.
“There are encouraging signs that the credit assumptions we have got are holding up, the government support we are seeing for the corporate sector has bought them time,” Stevenson told investors on a conference call.

Restructuring revved up
Faced with fewer options to bolster revenue growth, Asia-focused HSBC has been looking to reduce costs globally and in June resumed plans to cut around 35,000 jobs it had put on ice after the coronavirus outbreak.
The bank has no immediate plans to cut more jobs, Stevenson told Reuters, but that could happen as its transformation plans continue.
HSBC said on Tuesday it plans to reduce annual costs to below $31 billion by 2022, a more ambitious target than it set out in February and well below the operating expenses of $42.3 billion it reported in 2019.
It will also accelerate the transformation of its U.S. business, where it has long struggled to compete with much bigger players, and will provide an update at its 2020 results in February.
HSBC, which in common with other British lenders stopped paying dividends earlier this year at the request of regulators, said it would communicate a revised dividend policy in February.
Analysts and investors fear the lender could cut payouts in the long run.
“When we start paying distributions again, we’ll start conservatively and build from there,” Stevenson said on the conference call.

Sri Lanka’s life insurance market leader Ceylinco Life has posted consolidated income of Rs. 26 billion for the nine months ending 30 September, achieving noteworthy top line growth of 14% in a period dominated by adverse conditions for business.
Gross Written Premium income for the period grew by 13.8% to Rs. 15.5 billion, while investment and other income increased by 14.3% to Rs. 10.8 billion, the Company reports.
Ceylinco Life transferred Rs. 6.7 billion to its life fund for the period under review, enlarging the life fund to Rs. 103.6 billion as at 30 September and transferred Rs. 2.9 billion to the shareholders’ fund in respect of the nine months, increasing the shareholder fund to Rs. 35.8 billion at the end of the third quarter.
The Company said it paid Rs. 9.1 billion in net claims and benefits to policyholders for the period, an increase of 12.8% over the corresponding nine months of the previous year.
Ceylinco Life reported profit of Rs. 5.29 billion before tax and Rs. 4.18 billion after tax for the nine months, recording declines of 8.4% and 6.7% respectively, on account of a lower transfer of Rs. 2.9 billion to shareholder profits as against Rs. 3.3 billion for the first nine months of 2019.
“Our results reflect Ceylinco Life’s ability to maintain its momentum in terms of volumes even in difficult times, as well as the resilience of the Company’s investment strategies,” Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO Thushara Ranasinghe commented. 
“A decline in profits was anticipated and factored in, as a consequence of the need to make provisions for the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business. We remain confident that our business model will generate equitable returns for policyholders and shareholders alike, while expanding the footprint of life insurance in the market,” he added.
Total assets of Ceylinco Life grew by Rs. 27.5 billion or 20.7% since 31 December 2019 to Rs. 160.7 billion as at 30 September, while the Company’s investment portfolio increased by Rs. 27.4 billion or 23.5% over the nine months to Rs. 144.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of the year. The Company’s net-assets-value-per-share stood at Rs. 716.08 as at 30 September, up by Rs. 86.23 or 13.6% year-on-year (YOY).
Sri Lanka’s leading life insurer for more than half of the 32 years it has been in existence and certified as a ‘Great Workplace’ in Sri Lanka by Great Place to Work, Ceylinco Life was ranked the Most Valuable Life Insurance Brand in Sri Lanka by Brand Finance this year and declared the ‘Peoples Life Insurance Service Provider of the Year’ for the 14th consecutive year at the 2020 SLIM-Nielsen Peoples Awards.

NDB recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Codevus Ltd. under NDB’s ‘Jayagamu Sri Lanka’ initiative as a means to give customers a value chain management facility through a comprehensive ERP platform enabling them to efficiently handle their day to day administrative functions as well as support chains.
Accordingly, NDB entered into a partnership with Codevus to deliver an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform branded ‘dislio’ to the Bank’s SME base. 
The ERP solution provides a cost-effective platform that enables its users to efficiently manage their entire value chain, from administrative functions to HR, inventory management, supplier management, etc.
NDB has thus taken the first step towards providing comprehensive ERP solutions by tying up with Codevus to deliver an affordable, efficient and user friendly interface to enable the bank’s SME base to develop their businesses especially during times such as these where the COVID-19 pandemic has made a massive impact on businesses around the globe.
The Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contribute to almost half of Sri Lanka’s economy and provide employment to more than 52% workforce. The SMEs are thus an important part of the ecosystem and it is imperative that they get access to the right infrastructure to grow.
NDB introduced the ‘NDB Jayagamu Sri Lanka’ initiative in order to create a pathway for Sri Lanka’s exporters, innovators and entrepreneurs to have the necessary means to target the companies that are looking to diversify their supply chain, thus bringing in much needed revenue in to Sri Lanka.
The uniqueness of ‘NDB Jayagamu Sri Lanka’ is that it is more than just a loan scheme with loan approval in seven working days to assist entrepreneurs, exporters and innovators of the country. It is also a platform in which they will receive a boost to kick start their businesses as well as a place in which they will receive the support and the means to create new innovative ways to sell their wares. NDB, along with nearly 10 non-financial service and solution partners, will assist SMEs, innovators and exporters with financial and non-financial support.

Globally recognised Quick Response (QR) code banking is the next step in the evolutionary journey of banking and finance institutions in this technologically advanced world heralding the age of a cashless society.
In contrast to a traditional transaction involving the exchange of cash or equivalents for the purchase of goods and services by customer, QR code banking dispenses with the entire physical wallet in favour of a smart phone with a QR enabled digital payment application, where payments for any good or services simply entails scanning a QR code and paying funds.
By way of the digitalisation roadmap of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), the ‘Rata Purama LANKA QR’ islandwide campaign launched in collaboration with the member institutions, QR-based payments are fast becoming the norm in trade settlements.
As one of the few banks to receive accreditation for LANKA QR Transaction Types 1, 2, 3 and 4 both as acquirers and issuers from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), NSB is well equipped to lend credence to QR code banking in the industry. To this end, within a short period of a fortnight from launch NSB has onboarded upwards of 1,800 merchants indicating the popularity of QR code banking amongst its customers.
In addition, given a branch and postal network exceeding 4,000 points islands wide, NSB is in a unique position to enable even the smallest self-employed good or service provider to embrace QR code based banking and thereby incorporating a hitherto neglected segment to traditional banking.
Reminiscent of NSB’s tradition of saving cent by cent and rupee by rupee, now NSB account holders can venture out on their own no matter how small they are and yet be afforded financial inclusion using QR code banking offered by the leader in savings. Thus, with QR code based banking, dawns a new era of banking facilities especially for the informal sector of the economy to become formalised.
In keeping with NSB’s own path to complete digitalisation, NSB has incorporated many innovative facilities in the banking industry such as the Common ATM Switch (CAS), Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS), JustPay, Payment Exchange Name (PEN), Lanka Pay Online Payment Platform (LPOPP) and Direct Debit Authorisation (DDA).

SDB bank said in a statement yesterday it was able to extend its strong showing from the first half of the year 2020, maintaining financial momentum in quarter 3 while even recording a considerable profit. 
With the resurgence in COVID-19 cases towards the latter part of September, and the resultant stifled economic climate, the bank’s performance is indicative of the adaptable and innovative nature of their setup.
A resilient SDB bank displayed a considerable rise in profit year-over-year, with year-to-date net profit equalling Rs. 603 million by the end of the third quarter in 2020, as opposed to its performance of Rs. 50.9 million for the same period the previous year. Despite the challenges to economic growth experienced, the bank almost met its profit target of Rs. 628 million for the period ending September.
The profitability growth recorded was also complemented by a 15% year-over-year increase in SDB bank’s total asset base, standing at Rs. 123,600 million at the end of September 2020. The significance of their quarter 3 financials are rendered more meritable considering much of it ran alongside the COVID-19-affected stretch in the country, and with the MSME-majority shareholder portfolio they maintain.
The bank said it continued its heavy focus on offering unique savings and wealth creation initiatives to its sizeable MSME customer base, allowing for their continued well-being right through the pandemic-affected period. As a large percentage of SDB bank’s shareholder makeup is composed of the island’s significant rural and cooperative populations, all the profit earned goes right back to this vital segment of the national economy.
“With SDB bank further cementing its standing as the market leader in the all-important MSME segment, while recording a profitability increase and a high growth rate, the bank is well-placed to finish the year on a high with an equally strong display in the final quarter of 2020,” the bank said in its statement.

By The Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka

The insurance sector in Sri Lanka comprised of 27 insurance companies, 67 insurance brokering companies and 16 loss adjusters at the end of 2019. Out of the 27 insurers, 13 operated as life insurers carrying on long term insurance business, 12 engaged in general insurance business and two operated as composite insurers.
During the year, a composite insurer, Seemasahitha Sanasa Rakshana Samagama segregated its long term and general insurance businesses into two separate entities, namely Sanasa Life Insurance Company Ltd. and Sanasa General Insurance Company Ltd.
Over the last two years, new registrations of insurance brokering companies have slightly increased from 60 to 67.
With intensifying competition between market players, customer retention and cost effectiveness have become more critical, forcing insurance companies to seek ways to increase sales and customer satisfaction while keeping costs low and maintaining profitability. This has led to the emergence of new alternative distribution channels, such as online platforms, mobile applications and social media, etc., which drive premium growth at lower costs.
 
Premium income and growth rate
The Sri Lankan insurance industry achieved a growth rate of 8.64% in terms of overall Gross Written Premium (GWP) for both long term and general insurance business sectors in 2019. The total GWP income for both sectors was Rs. 196,513 million compared to Rs. 180,880 million in 2018, recording an increase of Rs. 15,633 million.
The long term insurance sector generated a GWP of Rs. 88,781 million in 2019, up by 10.57% against the GWP of Rs. 80,294 million generated in 2018. The general insurance sector recorded a GWP of Rs. 107,732 million in 2019, posting a growth of 7.10% compared to Rs. 100,586 million recorded in 2018.
The reinsurance premium income generated by the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF) from the compulsory reinsurance cession of general insurance business amounted to Rs. 4,174 million during 2019, recording an increase of 2.91% against the reinsurance premium of Rs. 4,056 million generated in 2018. (Refer chart 1)
 
Insurance penetration and density
Insurance penetration which is reflected by the insurance premium as a percentage of GDP amounted to 1.31% in 2019. Although insurance penetration had slightly increased in 2019 compared to 1.26%, which was recorded in 2018, it is still low compared to other countries in the Asian region. Penetration of the long term insurance business in 2019 stood at 0.59% (2018: 0.56%) and the penetration of the general insurance business was 0.72% (2018: 0.70%), recording a slight increase in both long term and general insurance businesses compared to the penetration ratio recorded in 2018.
Over the last few years, consumer confidence on insurance and behavioral pattern to purchase insurance products have gradually increased due to increased public awareness and improved services and product developments introduced by insurance companies
Insurance density reflects the insurance premium income per person of the population. This has increased to Rs. 9,013 in 2019 compared to Rs. 8,347 recorded in 2018, growing by 7.98%.
 
Assets of the sector
As depicted in Chart 2, the value of total assets of insurance companies has increased to Rs. 696,283 million in 2019, when compared to Rs. 630,447 million recorded in 2018, reflecting a growth of 10.44%. The assets of Long Term Insurance Business amounted to Rs. 485,723 million (2018: Rs. 430,759 million) indicating a growth of 12.76% year-on-year. The assets of General Insurance Business amounted to Rs. 203,870 million (2018: Rs. 196,005 million) and recorded a growth of 4.01%.
Despite the constant reduction in assets observed in previous two years, NITF managed to display a notable growth in the assets of their reinsurance business, recording a total of Rs. 6,690 million as at 31 December 2019. This was predominantly driven by the substantial increase in the investments held in Government Debt Securities relating to the reinsurance business of NITF.
 
Claims incurred by insurance companies
A total of Rs. 36,079 million (2018: Rs. 34,416 million) claims were incurred in the Long Term Insurance Business during the year 2019 recording an increase of 4.83% over 2018. Total claims incurred comprised of disability benefits, death benefits, surrenders, maturity benefits and other benefits paid to policyholders.

Net claims incurred by all sub classes of general insurance business had increased in year 2019 compared to previous year except for miscellaneous insurance business.
 
Number of insurance policies issued and policies in force – long term insurance business
At the end of 2019, total number of long term insurance policies in force was 3,402,663 and increased by 6.35% compared to 3,199,354 policies in force at the end of 2018. The life insurance industry in Sri Lanka continued to expand during year 2019 and issued 736,961 new life insurance policies, increasing by 3.63% compared to 711,126 new policies issued in 2018 as indicated in Chart 3.
Number of life insurance policies in force as a percentage of total population was 15.61% in 2019 compared to 14.76% recorded in 2018. Number of life policies in force as a percentage of labour force has continued to rise over time except in year 2017. This trend continued in 2019 and increased to 41.59% which demonstrates the fact that the sector as a whole continues to thrive.
The trend line reflects the way forward for life insurance business in Sri Lanka and the potential of expansion in a market known for its low penetration rates.
 
Insurance policy lapses – long term insurance business
Chart 4 depicts a slight reduction in lapse rates in terms of new insurance policies and total insurance policies in year 2019. Total lapsed life insurance policies amounted to 249,744 (2018: 268,339) in year 2019 and 86,139 (2018: 86,484) out of same consists of new lapsed policies.

Health policies in force have increased by 40.37% in 2019 compared to 2018.
 
Profitability of insurance companies
Long term insurance business displayed an increasing trend in its profitability during last two years mainly as a result of surplus transfers made by many insurers, including the One-off Surplus and the substantial profit earned by Janashakthi Life in 2018 from selling of its subsidiary investment of Janashakthi General to Allianz Gen. However, in 2019, the profitability showed a decline of 24.92% compared to 2018, after certain life insurers namely SLIC, Union Life, Sanasa Life, HNB Life, Arpico and Allianz Life reporting decreased profits for the year, largely driven by escalated claims and contracted surplus transfers. The profitability of long term insurance business amounted to Rs. 19,540 million (2018: Rs. 26,027 million) mainly driven by Ceylinco Life.
The overall profitability of general insurance business was largely impacted by the decreased performance of Allianz General, Ceylinco General and Amana General during the year mainly driven by the increased claims especially in ‘Suraksha Scheme’ of Allianz General. Accordingly, the total profit before tax of general insurance business amounted to Rs. 11,130 million in 2019 (2018: Rs. 11,737 million), exhibiting a decline of 5.17% compared to year 2018.
However, NITF, LOLC General and SLIC reported notable upturns in profitability compared to last year. The improved profitability of NITF was predominantly driven by the GWP increase of Agrahara (health insurance scheme for the public sector employees), National Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme (NNDIS) and SRCC & T schemes. Further, insurance claims pertaining to NNDIS scheme fell down notably compared to 2018.
 
Dispute resolution and Investigations
The IRCSL, under its overall objective of safeguarding the interests of policyholders, inquiries into policyholders’ grievances in connection with insurance claims pertaining to life and general insurance policies. The IRCSL also investigates into any other complaints referred to it against any insurer, broker, loss adjuster or agent. During 2019, 315 new matters were referred to the Commission. A total of 352 matters (including matters carried forward) were settled/closed during the period. Aggregate value of the claims settled during the period, with the intervention of the Commission, is around Rs. 139 million.
 
Insurance brokering companies
By the end of 2019, 67 insurance brokering companies operated in the market and generated a Gross Written Premium (GWP) amounting to Rs. 29,317 million. Accordingly, total GWP generated through insurance brokering business recorded a growth of 16.97% in 2019 when compared to Rs. 25,063 million generated in 2018.
This total GWP consisted of premium income generated through long term insurance business and general insurance business which amounted to Rs. 1,095 million and Rs. 28,222 million respectively. Out of the total GWP generated by insurance brokers, 96.26% represented GWP of general insurance business and only 3.74% represented GWP of long term insurance business. Insurance brokering companies have generated 26.20% of the total GWP of general insurance business which amounted to Rs. 107,732 million (including SRCC & T premium). Similar to previous years, the contribution of insurance brokering companies towards long term insurance business was insignificant in 2019. As per the details provided by the brokering companies, only 1.23% of the total GWP of long term insurance business (Rs. 88,781 million) was generated through brokers.
In 2019, thirty-one insurance brokering companies procured GWP exceeding Rs.100 million each and these insurance brokering companies collectively generated GWP amounting to Rs. 27,897 million. The remaining thirty-six insurance brokering companies generated GWP amounting to Rs. 1,420 million representing around 5% of the GWP of brokers.
 
Challenges for the future
Industry analysts predict that the general insurance sector would face a fundamental structural change over the next few decades, with a possible decline in premiums from motor class, the main line of general insurance business of today as a result of technological advances.
The insurance industry is about to face unprecedented effects of COVID-19 pandemic, which has currently put the entire world at an enormous threat. Even the healthcare systems of most powerful and richest nations in the world are struggling to cope up with the situation. As many countries and regions had been locked down for months, the adverse impact on economies is widening continuously.
The pandemic-led business interruptions and volatility in the equity markets would likely to distress the pricing of instruments and hinder the investment yields of insurance companies. Death benefits and hospital benefits would be a main concern for long term insurance companies, whereas the general insurers would face losses arising out of mainly travel, employee liability, business interruption and health insurance policies. Thus, the insurers worldwide should adjust their budgets and implementation plans, and even limit the dividend distributions, as the maintenance of adequate reserves and capital positions is vital to face this situation.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka was seen holding its policy rates steady at 4.50% and 5.50% at its Monitory policy announcement yesterday. The secondary market bond yields were seen increasing right after the policy announcement at the start of the trading day. 
Activity mainly centred on the liquid maturities of 2022’s (i.e. 15.11.22 and 15.12.22), 15.09.24, 2026’s (i.e. 01.02.26 and 01.08.26), 15.10.27 & 01.07.28 with its yields increasing to intraday highs of 5.60% each, 6.10%, 6.68%, 6.75%, 6.92% and 7.15% respectively against its previous day’s closing level of 5.35/50, 5.40/50, 5.95/03, 6.45/53, 6.50/60, 6.78/88 and 6.90/05.

Sri Lanka has shown a high literacy rate of about 92% compared to other south Asian countries, and is on par with other developed countries. However, there is a noted dearth of surveys and studies that assesses the financial literacy level in the Sri Lankan context. 
It is observed that people with low levels of financial literacy suffer from that lack of knowledge at every stage of their lives and studies also assert that people with a high degree of financial literacy are more likely to plan for retirement, and that people who plan for retirement have more than doubled the wealth of people who don’t. On the other hand, the quite alarming fact noted is that even some educated professionals had fallen into the prey of financial scams in Sri Lanka, questioning the financial literacy of such intellectuals. 
Thus, a study was carried out involving the undergraduates in the Sri Lankan state universities (due to being one of the major sources of future leaders) to find the level of financial literacy and how different specialisations impact the financial literacy levels. In the research conducted by the authors, the undergraduates were tested on their fundamental financial knowledge on dimensions of general finance, saving and borrowings (i.e. banking products), insurance and investment areas, and nearly 653 students from the five main state universities in 10 main disciplines (business and non-business disciplines) were selected, where the data was collected over a period of 1 1/2 years. Undergraduates of the business discipline included undergraduates from accountancy and business management and non-business discipline included undergraduates from the fields of engineering, physical sciences, humanities and social sciences and information technology. 
The findings indicate that the overall financial literacy level was on average 69.58% out of 100% of undergraduates in the business discipline. In terms of the sub-dimensions of financial literacy, these undergraduates scored the highest of 74.51% in the savings and borrowing sub-category, while they scored the lowest of 59.08% in the investment sub-dimension. When compared with the general literacy rate of 92% of this country, the findings of this study indicate that their overall average is quite lower as well as knowledge in investment sub-dimension is even lower. 
The alarming finding is related with the undergraduates coming from the non-business majors, where the average financial literacy level was only 42.83% out of 100%, which is even lower than 50%. This we see as a major concern. Their knowledge in the investment related sub-dimension was just 28.16% out of 100%. 
When considering these findings of the research conducted by the authors, it is clear that the undergraduates coming from the business management discipline had a better knowledge than students from non-business management discipline. Although the students coming from the non-business disciplines may be conversant in their own areas of study, they were lacking an awareness in fundamental financial aspects that any citizen should possess to continue normal day-to-day life. 
The authors observe that there is a systematic deficiency of personal finance education in our local education system. Introduction of subjects related to financial literacy for all students (regardless their discipline) in their formative stages as well as introducing course components related to accounting and finance in the curriculums of non-business majors at universities (and other tertiary institutions) could be suggested to remedy this dire situation.

The alliance offers much-needed awareness in managing the spread of the virus to mitigate the potential disruption to the health and wellbeing of our citizens and their livelihoods.  
Recent research shows a positive correlation in public awareness on attitude and practice, concluding that public awareness must be improved to be prepared for epidemic and pandemic situations. A comprehensive public health education program is important to increase awareness and to reach sufficient knowledge.
The awareness drive kicked off on 19 October conveys a powerful message, ‘Arakshawe Wagakeema Itukaramu’ to remind the public of their responsibility in protecting themselves and others. The digital-first campaign presents a series of videos and posts on best practices supported by traditional and outdoor media.
Union Assurance CEO Jude Gomes commented on the efforts: “We are in solidarity with the national efforts to support COVID-19 protection. At this point we understand that creating awareness is a priority and we consider it our obligation as a responsible corporate citizen to support the national cause. We want to spread this message to all parts of the country and minimise the negative implications of a community spread.” 
As with other respiratory infections like the flu or the common cold, public health measures are critical to slow the spread of illnesses. Such measures are everyday preventive actions that include staying home when sick, covering mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing. 
Dispose of used tissue immediately, washing hands with soap and water, and cleaning frequently touched surfaces and objects. The campaign will aim to enhance public awareness in staying protected individually, and being responsible for others in our communities.

With the aim of helping Government pensioners in senior citizens with matters such as their medical treatments as well as children's housing, higher education and nuptials, People's Bank has also introduced a special loan scheme for senior citizens. 
The loan scheme allows them to borrow an amount where the monthly loan instalment can go up to 75% of their monthly pension with a repayment period of up to 10 years. For loan periods of five years, the interest rate is 9.5% while it's 10% for loan periods of 10 years. The age limit for the loan scheme is up to 75 years and no guarantors are required.

Fitch Ratings said this week that the risk of a second coronavirus wave, together with weak borrower sentiment in an already fragile operating environment, would put further stress on Lankan finance and leasing companies’ (FLCs) credit profiles, adding to existing pressures on asset quality and profitability. These risks will test FLCs’ loss-absorbing capacity, but Fitch Ratings believes that the capital and profit buffers of most Fitch-rated standalone-driven FLCs1 (except for Bimputh, which will experience material
capital erosion due to losses) will be adequate to cushion against moderate asset-quality shocks.
Fitch expects Sri Lanka’s real GDP to contract by 3.7% in 2020 due to the pandemic. The economic fallout has pressured the FLC sector’s asset quality with the six-months past due non-performing loans (NPLs) ratio spiking to 14.1% by end-June (1QFY21) (FYE20: 11.4%). The sector’s return on assets turned negative to -2.3% in 1QFY21 (FYE20: 1.9%) due to high credit costs.
Noting that the sector faces growth challenges, Fitch said a prolonged restriction on vehicle importation and the resultant surge in second-hand vehicle prices are likely to hamper Sri Lankan FLCs’ medium-term growth prospects.
The sector’s loans contracted by 0.2% YOY in 1QFY21 (CAGR of 12% FY15–FY20), and leasing and hire purchases, accounted for 55% of the sector’s lending (FYE15: 60%).
Fitch expects underlying asset-quality pressure that has been building up due to the pandemic to manifest from 3QFY21 and extend to FY22, as regulatory relief in the form of loan-repayment moratoriums has temporarily halted the recognition of credit impairments for much of this year. 
“We believe that most of the FLCs’ borrowers will not emerge unscathed from the economic downturn because they are largely sub-prime,” it added.
Fitch also said weak earnings due to rising credit costs and slow loan growth will weigh on FLCs’ internal capital generation. “We view this risk as more acute for small FLCs which already have weak profitability buffers, with credit costs consuming more than 70% of their pre-impairment operating profits,” it said. 
A deadline extension to meet capital requirements and lower loan growth, according to Fitch, will ease near-term capital pressures for some companies. Out of 38 licenced finance companies in the sector, nine were non-compliant with minimum capital requirements at end-September 2020, and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has granted an extension to rectify the non-compliance. 
Fitch said banks’ diminished appetite to lend to the FLC sector could hurt small-to-mid-sized FLCs in particular, hampering their financial flexibility. Small entities tend to rely more on bank funding, while large FLCs’ better domestic franchises will underpin their liquidity profiles.

FRANKFURT MAIN (AFP): German reinsurance giant Munich Re said Monday that it anticipates a boom in cyber-risk insurance in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
Lockdowns and restrictions on movements to combat the spread of the virus meant that office workers have had to work more from home, with companies migrating business online.
That has resulted in a “sharp rise in cyber-attacks”, according to Doris Hoepke, a member of Munich Re’s board.
The Bavaria-based company said the cyber insurance market could grow to around $20 billion (17.1 billion euros) by 2025 from a little more than $7.0 billion at present, above current forecasts for growth.
“Additional, pandemic-fuelled momentum from digitalisation and companies’ rising awareness of cyber risks can further boost a market already exhibiting robust growth,” Hoepke added.
The pandemic shifted targets for cyber attackers from individuals to major corporations, governments and critical infrastructure, according to an Interpol report published in August.
The relative lack of security infrastructure of home working will mean “cyber criminals continue to ramp up their activities and develop more advanced and sophisticated modi operandi,” the worldwide anti-crime organisation said.
Munich Re added that insurance coverage is “likely to become more expensive” as interest rates remain at rock-bottom levels “for the foreseeable future”, curtailing insurers’ investment income.

With the digitalisation of the economy, transactions that take place on platforms may not always be reported to tax administrations. With tax playing an important role in every country’s revenue, especially when they are faced with increased costs relating to their responses to the coronavirus pandemic, there are tax measures governments could adopt to curb the economic fallout of the crisis and thereafter to build on lessons learned from elsewhere, to improve the resilience and agility of tax administrations for the future.
Thus, the ‘Digital Taxation - tax challenges of digitalization webinar’, organised by The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) in association with Sri Lanka Institute of Taxation on 21 October, is a timely event. 
The session will discuss Digital Services Tax (DST), what changes in the global economy disrupted traditional means of taxation, what unilateral actions have already been taken across the world, what is happening in the Asia-Pacific and why are DSTs/taxation on digital transactions so problematic. 
Also explored would be whether there are better options—ways to adapt our current system without introducing complex and economically harmful policies and what’s the risk of the process resulting in new and harmful taxes, especially in the context of post-COVID-19 economic recovery.
Giving their perspectives at the event will be Ernst & Young – Singapore International Tax and Transaction Services Partner Hsin Yee, Digital Mobility Solutions Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. CEO Jiffry Zulfer, Million Spaces (Pvt) Ltd. Chairman and CEO Prasath Nanayakkara, Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) Chairman Jayantha De Silva and Department of Inland Revenue Commissioner—Large Tax Payer Services, Member of Sri Lanka Institute of Taxation Unit S. W. Pradeep Silva.
The session will be moderated by Ernst & Young – Sri Lanka Partner Tax, Sulaiman Nishtar ACMA, FCMA,

Financial inclusion is essential for continuous and sustainable economic development, according to IFC. This is no exception for Sri Lanka despite showing strong numbers in bank penetration. 
According to the World Bank Group’s (WBG) Global Findex for 2017, nearly 74% of the population in Sri Lanka have accounts at a financial institution, higher than the regional average in South Asia of 70% (36%, excluding India). Sri Lanka also enjoys high levels of bank branch penetration, with bank branch density of 16.5 per 100,000 adults as of December 2018 (CBSL). 
Sri Lanka therefore has a high penetration rate but achieving the zenith – stronger financial inclusion – is fraught with constraints. Though 83% of all Lankan adults have bank accounts and over 80% of adult women have savings accounts, financial inclusion is not satisfactory in Sri Lanka.  Realising this, Sri Lanka began work to improve financial inclusion. 

Work on financial inclusion
The Central Bank’s work on Sri Lanka’s first National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) was expected to be implemented in early 2020 with other relevant authorities. The bank receives technical assistance from the International Finance Corporation (IFC). 
The NFIS was conducted to “increase financial accessibility for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), done under four policy pillars; digital finance and payments, MSME finance, consumer protection and financial literacy and capacity building,” according to the former Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy (October 2019).
According to Coomaraswamy over 75% of businesses in Sri Lanka (over one million) are MSMEs, providing employment for 45% of the labour force (3.2 million persons) and generating 52% of Gross Domestic Product, and thus are vital for the country’s economic growth. 
However, most MSMEs suffer from a lack of access to the formal financial ecosystem. High interest rates, the need for collateral and lack of formal documentation are the most frequently cited constraints for MSMEs to access finance in Sri Lanka, and so many are forced to deal with informal financial institutions which charge even higher interest rates. MSMEs need rationalised structures for financial inclusiveness. 
Interestingly, though ‘banks’ have been mentioned as having ‘some programs which provide refinance and credit guarantee schemes and interest subsidies for MSMEs’, one of the most powerful mechanisms that can access MSMEs for their financial inclusion are not mentioned at all-the Non-Banking Financial Sector (NBFI), and specifically the Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs) within the NBFIs.

Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs)
If Financial Inclusion (FI) is defined as creating first time lenders and borrowers – including MSMEs-into mainstream finance, NBFI is a key financial inclusion driver in Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka NBFI sector bridges the formal and informal financing sectors by linking 60% of workforce to secure financing – the formal financing sector. The result is that NBFI rescues the struggling MSMEs from the most informal mechanisms such as loan-sharks and money lenders. 
NBFIs, especially the LFCs, take the risk of becoming the intuitional link for these MSMEs. As I recently described in a public forum on financial inclusion, the predominant role of NBFI, especially LFCs, is that it is a potent mechanism to reach lower income, Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP) market. 
Around 50% of BoP funding takes place through NBFIs, creating a massive stake in employment. Sri Lankan microfinancing market is totally (100%) financed by the NBFIs. They provide services to more than three million depositors in Sri Lanka with a total deposit base of Rs. 750 b. 
In addition, 55% of the CRIB reports are accessed by NBFI sector which bears testimony to the high impact of NBFIs despite having only 10% of the loan portfolio of the banking and finance industry. Also 90% of three-wheeler market, 70% of private bus passenger transport, 75% tractors and agricultural equipment, and 70% of small transport vehicles such as light trucks are NBFI funded.

NBFIs fund the BoP market
Though NBFIs are only around 8-10% of entire financial sector, 55% of CRIB reports are obtained by NBFIs. With a deposit base totalling Rs. 760 billion, the NBFI sector is therefore critical for the economy; 70% of its loan portfolio is funded by public deposits.
What is important in these numbers is that the MSMEs, the backbone of Lankan economy, predominantly depend on NBFI to meet their funding needs. Even though the commercial banking sector’s assets are eight times larger than NBFIs, NBFIs – unlike the formal banking sector – reach the very bottom of the pyramid that is out of reach for the banks. Such an access to BoP – a larger section of society – helps budding entrepreneurs to grow – a key step forward in developing the economy. 
If this portrayal does not convince anyone of the importance of LFC in Sri Lanka’s financial inclusion quest, then perhaps nothing else will. That is since no other regulated institutional financing mechanism in the country has the immediacy to the bottom of the pyramid that LFCs have. Any national financial inclusion effort that misses this point should be seriously reconsidered. 

History of the FHA
The FHA is the successor of the Ceylon Hire Purchase & Finance Association, founded in 1958. The association was formed to discuss the emerging problems in an unregulated industry at that time. The Association was successively renamed as the Finance Houses Association of Sri Lanka (FHA) in 1986. In the course of its history of over 62 years, the FHA has grown in form and stature to discharge a broad range of activities, expanding its original objectives.

Reviewing savings and investment accounts are vital to ensure they are in the right place and that your risks are controlled. Doing this on your own can be a challenging task to most individuals both in terms of time and money. Funds sitting idly in a savings or a current account will not bring any long term benefit. Having the right wealth manager or investment adviser will help you make a prudent savings plan. Seeking the assistance of an expert financial advisor like NDB Wealth can help you to make sound decisions. Moving funds to a money market such as NDB Wealth Money Plus account will be one positive option.

Appointing trusted professionals to carry out the necessary tasks at the opportune time will make one feel very much at peace. 
Another area that needs attention is the reassessing of insurance policies. It’s important to review the policies to ensure that they are necessary, updated, cost effective and more importantly applicable to meet your current conditions and needs. 
“Financial planning and fund management is increasingly playing a critical role in the life of every person. Whether you are planning for your retirement or are saving for a rainy day, it’s important to know that you are doing the right thing for yourself, your family or even your business,” stated Assistant Vice President – Investment Management Indika De Silva.

A demutualised stock exchange would assist in creating a share owning democracy, complementing the Sri Lankan economy, and be a compliment to the economy of Sri Lanka - Pic by Sameera Wijesinghe

The genesis
With the extinction of the coffee plantation and the introduction of tea to Sri Lanka, the need arose for British planters, who put in all their funds into the coffee plantation, to look at a better risk-free model to fund the newly introduced tea plantation in Sri Lanka. With that came the birth of the Companies Act and the requirement for companies to have access to capital, and as a result, the origins of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in 1896. 
Until the introduction of a regulated market place in 1987, the CSE functioned with a close club of investors with mostly unwritten laws, regulations, and ethics governing them. The birth of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as a regulator for capital markets, prescribed that the CSE should be a company that is limited by guarantee, where the distribution of profits is not allowed. The CSE is owned by 15 member firms and the Board consist of nine members, out of which five are nominated by its membership. To maintain national interest, four directors are appointed by the Minister of Finance. The chairman will be a nominee from the member firms. 
In and around the year 2000 by a directive issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the CSE admitted trading members who did not have a right to vote, however, with a right to use the trading platform. They also had an explicit condition imposed on them that they will not benefit or participate in any demutualisation proceeds that would occur in the event the CSE is demutualised. 

What is demutualisation?
Over the last two decades, stock exchanges in the world have undergone radical changes and moved towards demutualisation. Demutualisation, in the strictest sense, refers to the change in the legal status of the exchange from a mutual association with one vote per member (and possibly consensus-based decision making), into a company limited by shares, with one vote per share (with majority-based decision making). 
Demutualisation makes sense if it induces a change in the exchange’s objective from managing the interests of a closed member-based organisation with a central focus on providing services for the benefit primarily of the members/brokers and keeping costs and investments limited to financing agreed by members, into a company set up to maximise the value of the equity shares by focusing on generating profits from servicing the demands of their customers competitively. 
The transformation of exchanges from mutual to demutualised structure involves two key features: a change in the ownership structure, and a change in legal as well as organisational form. 
Both need to be accompanied by adequate safeguards to ensure appropriate governance. Depending on the nature of ownership and legal forms adopted, the demutualised exchange - given their corporate model and facing growing competitive pressures - lends itself to focusing on evolving strategic positioning which, depending on several conditions, could involve greater market consolidation, vertical integration, and product diversification. The objective of demutualisation is to develop and maintain appropriate structures to achieve good governance. 








 






International take on demutualisation 
Demutualised exchanges operate as for-profit entities organised as companies with share capital which may even be listed and publicly traded. Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong are exchanges that are demutualised, with their shares traded on the exchange. 
The process of demutualisation is a complex one, which needs to strike a balance between profit-making and investor protection. Concerns regarding the ability of this approach to do are wide. As it leads to sacrificing effective regulation to meet short-term gains and to maximise shareholder profits. Needless to say, for-profit exchanges and its management tend to prioritise profit and business development to dedicate resources to the regulation of the market and its participants.
A taskforce for demutualisation was set-up under the auspices of the International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO), the apex body of capital market regulators. The body held wide consultations and deliberations on some of the matters deliberated above. Its findings focused on minimising and managing challenges and involved recommendations which included the introduction of public interest directors to the Board of the Exchange to better ensure the integrity of the regulation process, some of them listed below;

1. The introduction of ‘public interest directors’ to the Board of the exchange to better ensure the integrity of the regulatory processes. 
2. A clear statutory statement of the obligation to provide a fair and efficient public trading market. 
3. Publication of the decisions, actions, rules, and regulations of the exchange as well as that of the regulator to enhance transparency. 
4. Functional separation of the commercial activities of the exchange from its regulatory functions.
5. Rigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement mechanisms to enhance the exchange’s accountability to the government regulator and the public.
6. A cap on share ownership.

Drawing on international experience and expertise, a demutualised exchange should be structured in a manner to prevent any possible takeovers. A cap on share ownerships, ideally 5%, with some exchanges have higher limits, to forestall any person or entity taking control. Furthermore, even if one or a group of persons obtain majority shares, they would not be able to appoint a majority of the Board and in most cases the majority comprises of executive directors and Government appointees. 
After much deliberation, the SEC and the CSE have moved forward in taking this decisive step to demutualise the CSE by presenting a new SEC Act and a Demutualisation Act in Bill form to Parliament for deliberation in 2018. In this respect, the SEC Act needs to be amended to facilitate the licensing of a demutualised exchange and the regulations thereunder. Provisions should be made to convert the CSE from a company limited by a guarantee to a company with share ownership and thus the need for a Demutualisation Act. 
The decision to demutualise the CSE was founded on the fact that the old mutual association structure failed to provide flexibility and the resources needed to compete in a competitive environment. The notion of not-for-profit was not a motivating factor for the management and needed entrepreneurs with the discipline to run the organisation in an efficient and keeping-up-with-the-times manner.

The legal angle
The Articles of Association of the CSE, a not-for-profit organisation, stipulates that at a time of liquidation the asset of such organisation should be transferred by the Registrar of Companies to an organisation of similar standing and objectives. This is stipulated in section 83 that at the time of liquidation the assets of the exchange must be given or transferred to some other institution or institutions having objects similar to the objects of the Exchange. 
The CSE has considerable assets that cannot be distributed amongst its members. Strictly speaking, the assets then must go to charity as there is no other institution performing the role of the exchange. This highlights the necessity to promulgate legislation for demutualisation. 
The most talked-about and contagious issue is the share allocation to the necessary stakeholders. It will be interesting to note that one of the most successful demutualisations was the Bursa Malaysia due to the top-down approach adopted by the then Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohammed who personally drove the initiative until the best possible outcome was achieved.
The methodology adopted in Malaysia was the identifying of stakeholders and apportion of shares to them based on the contribution they have made towards the development of the exchange. It was identified that in addition to the stockbrokers (member firms) they identified listed companies, investors, and the State to have contributed towards such development. After a proper analysis, these stakeholders were presented with appropriate stakes in the demutualised stock exchange. As a result, the brokers – 30%, Remisiers – 10%, Capital Market Development Fund (CMDF) – 30%, Ministry of Finance (State) – 30% and created a CMDF for all other stakeholders that could not be identified individually. 
In Sri Lanka, on or about 2004, the then Chairman of the SEC, Dr. Dayanath C. Jayasuriya convened a meeting of the stockbrokers and came to a mutual agreement regarding apportion of shares to the brokers and other stakeholders. However, after that time, with several changes in the economic and political environment, seemingly there has being disputes on the consensus on this matter. The full members of the exchange are staking a high claim and were resistant to any fair position. 
The consultants of the Asian Development Bank recently concluded with a parameter for share allocation of the demutualisation. In the event the Malaysian approach is adopted, i.e. of identifying those who contributed to the development of the exchange, the situation may lead to trading members who were licensed after 2005 being eligible for a claim at the demutualisation.
On 26 January 2018 a Demutualisation of the Colombo Stock Exchange Bill was presented to provide for the demutualisation of the CSE by the conversion of the CSE which is a company limited by guarantee, to a company limited by shares; and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Now, with the change of the Government, a fresh Bill will need to be presented with the new SEC Bill for deliberation and approval. 
The 2018 Bill stipulated allocation of 60 per centum of the shares to be issued to the full members (stock brokers) and 40 per centum in respectively of the shares to the Capital Market Development Fund set up under the proposed new Act. A maximum ceiling of share ownership of 5 per centum is stipulated to prevent any possible or potential takeover. 
I trust that sufficient care has being taken in arriving at this demarcation particularly in respect of the allocation to the state via the Capital Market Development Fund. One must be mindful of donor contributions that were made to the CSE via the State and tax cuts and benefits given to the CSE be factored in computing the allocations.
Where members fail to agree on the allocation of the individual shareholding, each member shall be entitled to an equal proportion of the shares allocated to members (as at one time the members wanted their allocations based on their contributions and turnovers) of the demutualised Stock Exchange, to a maximum ceiling of five per centum for each member. 
The proposed Bill specifies that the Minister shall constitute a Nomination Panel consisting of the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Chairman of the University Grant Commission, Director General of the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka, Director General of the SEC and a member of the Board of Directors of the CSE/demutualised Stock Exchange, as the case maybe as determined by the Board of Directors within two months from the appointed date to recommend persons to serve as members of the Board of Directors of the demutualised Stock Exchange: 
The Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka shall be the Chairman of the Nomination Panel and the Director-General of the SEC shall be the Secretary of the Nomination Panel.
The selection of the Chairman of the University Grants Commission and the Director-General of the SEC to this Nomination Panel would raise concerns on relevancy and governance issues for a regulator to sit on the selection panel of recommending Directors to an entity regulated by him. 
The members of the Board of Directors of the demutualised Stock Exchange appointed shall consist of seven persons comprising—

(a) not more than three persons representing stockbrokers; and
(b) not less than four persons appointed as independent directors.

The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the demutualised Stock Exchange shall be elected by the Board of Directors from amongst the independent directors.
The Capital Market Development Fund set up under the Act is to further public interest through–

(a) the development of the capital market of Sri Lanka;
(b) the promotion of investor education;
(c) the improvement of capital market infrastructure; and
(d) the improvement of investor access and participation in the capital market.

The Board of Directors of the company incorporated for the Capital Market Development Fund set up under the Act shall be–

(a) the Chief Executive Officer of the Demutualised Stock Exchange;
(b) the Director-General of the Commission; and
(c) the nominee of the Chairman of the Commission with the concurrence of the Chairman of the Colombo Stock Exchange.

The appointment of the DG of the SEC seems inappropriate as he becomes a stakeholder in an institution he is regulating. 
The Board of Directors of the demutualised Stock Exchange shall take necessary action to list the demutualised Stock Exchange on its own exchange with the approval of the Commission within three years from the date of conversion unless otherwise specified in writing by the Commission. It is hoped that these anomalies will draw the attention of the drafters and rectified accordingly in the new Bill to be presented to this Parliament. 

The future
I trust that the demutualisation of the CSE will have a smooth passage without litigation glitches. A demutualised stock exchange would assist in creating a share owning democracy, complementing the Sri Lankan economy, and be a compliment to the economy of Sri Lanka. 
A move such as this has the capability of pegging the CSE on a level the same as developed exchanges in the world, having the potential to be a vibrant capital market and make Sri Lanka move towards a regional financial hub. This move will undoubtedly result in augmenting the stature of the CSE on par with other developed exchanges, enabling growth and sustainable development and building the infrastructure necessary for Sri Lanka’s transition into a regional financial hub.

AFC CEO Chandrin Fernando (left) and AMF CEO T.M.A. Sallay 

With an ambitious drive to be one of the successful finance companies in the country, the soon-to merger between Arpico Finance Company PLC (AFC) and Associated Motor Finance Company PLC (AMF) does not come entirely as a surprise. This will further strengthen the safety and trust of customers which was unblemished during the last 69 years.
Despite the transaction making little market overlap sense on the surface, it certainly hints at future strategic plans that will open doors to build one strong entity which will be safer for its depositors. It will also provide a pathway to enhance and strengthen its current capital position, complying with the objectives of the regulatory authorities.
The merger is also expected to enhance value through consolidating and administrating the operational infrastructures more efficiently while adding more value to all stakeholders, enabling the merged entity to emerge as a considerable force in the finance sector of Sri Lanka.
Commenting on this, Arpico Finance Company PLC CEO Chandrin Fernando stated that formalities on the merger with its major shareholder AMF have been on-going successfully. “The operational environment of the two companies is ready to proceed with the legal merger and it’s in progress. This will create a stronger entity in terms of capital and regulatory compliance and will provide more safety to the depositors,” he said.
Associated Motor Finance Company PLC CEO T.M.A. Sallay added, “We anticipate the merger with AFC to be completed very soon. This will undoubtedly improve overall synergies, leveraging on each other’s key strengths and competencies.” 
AMF acquired 94%t of shares in AFC in October 2014. Both the companies are regarded as two of the oldest finance companies in the country, achieving a consistent growth in a highly challenging and turbulent environment. AFC continues to rank as one of the leading licensed finance companies with the longest history in Sri Lanka with AMF following closely, claiming fourth position.
Established in 1951, Arpico Finance Company PLC with a track record of close to seven decades stands strong as one of the finance companies in the country. The company operates through 10 branches with its principal lines of business include finance leasing, mortgage loans, personal loans, and acceptance of time and savings deposits. 
Associated Motor Finance Company PLC was established in 1962 and currently has a wide dealer network island wide offering leasing with a portfolio largely comprising of two-wheelers, cars and vans. The group also specialises in mortgage loans, personal loans, and acceptance of time and savings deposits. As of 31 March, the Group Total Asset base was Rs. 20,336 million.

IASL President Iftikar Ahamed 


 





IASL MSF Chairman Dinesh Yogaratnam




The Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) conducted its annual Life Insurance Industry Sales Awards for the years 2019 and 2020. This awards ceremony which was held as a virtual event went live on 1 September, coinciding with National Insurance Day. 
The online event was graced by the Chief Guest, Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL) Chairman Razik Zarook, and Guest of Honour Director General Damayanthi Fernando.
IASL President Iftikar Ahamed sharing his thoughts said, “I take this opportunity firstly to congratulate the winners as well as those who qualified. This is a platform where you are pitted against the very best insurance sales professionals from across the industry. Being able to receive an accolade here is a remarkable achievement, to say the least. Now more than ever the need for insurance solutions is being felt around the country due to the impact of the ongoing pandemic. In that light, we as the insurance industry are obliged to provide our services that help people mitigate their risks to as great an extent as possible. 
“This is where the insurance advisor plays that ever-important role of conducting a proper need analysis in designing and offering customers the policy that addresses the aspects of risks that they intend to cover. Recognising these skilled insurance sales professionals was a necessity, with the aim of elevating the confidence of insurance professionals, rewarding them for their endeavours as they raise awareness and propel the insurance industry forward.” 
This competition was first conducted in 2018 and the awards ceremony was held as part of the National Forum for Life Insurance Advisors (NAFLIA) held in September 2019. However, with the onset of the pandemic and restrictions on public gatherings, the IASL decided to conduct a virtual event this year to recognise the winners for 2019 as well as 2020.  Sharing his thoughts, IASL Marketing and Sales Forum (MSF) Chairman Dinesh Yogaratnam said, “Developed as a national platform to recognise the best talent in the Life Insurance Industry, these awards were designed to recognise sales personnel based on their performance during the year with an evaluation of policy persistence taking place in the following year, as well as other qualifying criteria having to be met, thereby fostering sustained new business acquisition and retention within the industry.
“We had a total of 65 sales personnel, 34 for 2019 and 31 for 2020 being recognised at this event. The MSF took it upon itself to go ahead with this online event on the basis that a physical event would not be possible and we are very encouraged and enthusiastic at the reception and responses received. My heartiest wishes go out to the winners as well as those who qualified.”
The award categories included the Best Agent, Best Team/Unit Leader and the Best Branch Manager awards. These Category Awards were based on a categorisation of the company they are attached to, by size, in terms of Gross Written Premium (GWP). As such, the five companies that are top five in terms of GWP were classified as Company Category Large, the next five as Medium and the rest as Small. The National Level Winners were awarded from amongst the winners of the Category Awards where the top three received the Gold, Silver and Bronze awards, respectively.

ABA Chairman and HNB MD/CEO, Jonathan Alles

 




Top management of Sri Lanka’s premier private sector retail bank, HNB PLC, shared insights on banking in the ‘new-normal’ with Asian industry leaders representing some of the region’s most dynamic banking giants, at the recently concluded 37th General Meeting and Conference of the Asian Bankers Association (ABA).
The sessions were inaugurated by ABA Chairman and HNB MD/CEO, Jonathan Alles who also participated in multiple forums including the CEO roundtables on ‘Navigating the new world order’. HNB Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer, Dilshan Rodrigo also chaired the regulator roundtable sessions focused on current banking trends and their implications on regulatory policies.
Innovation: a silver lining in the pandemic

Innovation: A sliver lining in the pandemic 
Addressing the CEO roundtable, Alles presented a compelling case study on how HNB used the crisis that resulted from the pandemic as an opportunity to fast-track digital innovation, and optimise support to customers, enterprises and SMEs impacted by the on-going crisis.
“The COVID pandemic has certainly left a dark cloud over Sri Lanka and the world, but there were some silver linings as well. Initial hesitancy by some clients to adopt digital solutions gave way to rapid and unprecedented adoption of digital banking services. Timely investments in expanding our technological capacity and capabilities ensured that we were ready to deal with the drastic surge in usage.
“Having established a robust and reliable experience for customers, we are also improving middle-office productivity. HNB is particularly focused on leveraging data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic process automation (RPA) to further enhance customer service. We are also enhancing Business Intelligence tools to improve our predictive capabilities. Such insights will further increase resilience to continuing volatility, and strengthen our ability to support customers and revive economic activity,” Alles stated.

Empowering the rural sector
He further noted that the critical need of the hour for Sri Lanka was in extending this new paradigm in tech-empowered banking to the rural sector, for which HNB is actively pursuing partnerships to offer value-added services to this segment.
“Any tech or digital strategy which leaves out the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), would be futile, given that the sector accounts for approximately three quarters of the entire Sri Lankan market. Sri Lanka already has one of the highest levels of mobile and internet penetration in the region. As a result, most SMEs have already got the basic requirements – such as access to a smartphone and internet. That is all they need to start transacting digitally.”
“By offering the grassroots of our economy access to digital payments, cash management, distributor finance, supply chain financing models and standalone SME platforms, we see immense potential to rejuvenate the rural economy. The pandemic has also exposed Sri Lanka’s vital need to boost domestic production, and reduce dependence on global supply chains where possible. In response HNB is further expediting efforts to forge partnerships that will empower Sri Lankan agri-preneurs and techno-preneurs to step into these gaps, and create vibrant new businesses, in alignment with the Government’s vision for a grassroots-led economic revival,”Alles explained.

Conducive regulatory environment
Elaborating on the broader success which Sri Lanka has enjoyed in accelerating digitalisation across the banking sector, Alles commended the proactive stance of the Government and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, in prioritizing a conducive environment for technological change while fully supporting operational continuity during the pandemic
“The Government and CBSL took proactive action from the start of the pandemic, and almost immediately, banking was declared an essential service, enabling us to function through lockdowns, under tight new social distancing, health, and security regulations.”
“On the technology front, CBSL’s visionary digital transformation strategy has provided a vital framework and direction for banks to follow. As a result, Sri Lanka has made excellent progress in its digitalization journey, and all stakeholders are fully committed. With proactive action on programmes like LANKA QR we are already seeing a grassroots impact, and the future for the Sri Lanka’s digital ecosystem is very promising,”

Providing support to businesses
Alles further noted that supporting the recovery of pandemic-affected businesses will continue to be a key responsibility for all banks moving forward.
“Today, banks across the globe are working as a de facto delivery system, delivering cash for those in need. However, with no clear end in sight and the virus still rampant, banks are acutely aware that how they respond to the crisis now will determine how they will rebuild for the future. Providing support to governments and customers is crucial during this crisis. This will require banks to deploy the tools that they have developed since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, to lead a coherent and extensive response to unchartered territory. One thing is certain: a strong banking sector will be fundamental to a strong recovery.”
In a separate session, HNB Executive Director and COO, Dilshan Rodrigo also shared experiences on measures taken by HNB to provide substantial support to customers facing difficulties.
“Just after the start of the pandemic up to 40% of our client businesses were on debt moratorium, however, as conditions eased this has fallen to less than 15%. It is very encouraging that approximately 85% of our customers are now able to service their debt. This is due to their being able to adapt rapidly, supported by the bank and the regulator, as well as HNB’s proximity to customers, which enabled us to accurately identify customers who were most in need and genuinely required debt moratorium support.”

Greater workplace inclusivity
The technology improvement initiatives which have been implemented, together with the adoption of remote working arrangements as a result of the pandemic, is also contributing towards enhanced workplace inclusivity that benefits female employees, the HNB CEO pointed out.
“Even before COVID-19 HNB was actively seeking to ensure greater diversity in the workplace, and a more even gender balance in the workplace. In addition to recruitment initiatives, we also sought to provide as much maternity benefits for pregnant staff members, and those with young children to be able to work from home, as well as providing more options for part-time arrangements and fixed but flexible contracts that puts more choice in their hands.
“Now following the pandemic 60% to 70% of HNB employees are working from home or remote sites. Since the infrastructure was already in place it was just a matter of scaling it up, which of course included bringing in additional cyber and other controls. Based on the success we have achieved since then, I am confident that that we will be able to continue these arrangements, even after the pandemic ends,” an optimistic Alles noted, however pointing out that this requires a change in organizational culture.
Since 1981, the Asian Bankers Association (ABA) has been the premier platform for Asian banks. ABA is the ideal forum to network, conceive deals, share know-how, and advocate bankers’ interest nationally and internationally. ABA groups over 70 of the largest leading commercial banks and financial institutions in the Asia Pacific with the objectives of exploring banking opportunities in the region and enhancing the role of bankers in the economic development of the Asia Pacific.
With 254 customer centres across the country, HNB is one of Sri Lanka’s largest, most technologically innovative banks, having won local and global recognition for its efforts to drive forward a new paradigm in digital banking. HNB has a national rating of AA- (lka) by Fitch Ratings (Lanka) Ltd. The bank was also ranked among the World Top 1,000 Banks list compiled by the prestigious UK-based Banker Magazine for five consecutive years. HNB was also declared Best Sub-Custodian Bank in Sri Lanka at the Global Finance Awards 2020.

Sri Lanka’s leading private bank, HNB PLC, joined several internationally-renowned financial industry peers, in contributing to discourse on issues of key interest to the global banking industry, at the recent Policy Advocacy Committee Meeting of the Asian Bankers Association (ABA).
HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles, in his capacity as the current Chairman of the Asian Bankers Association, inaugurated the event while HNB Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer Dilshan Rodrigo, who also serves as the Chairman of the ABA’s Policy Advocacy Committee, served as the Session Chairman.
“Greater collaboration and knowledge sharing within the banking industry is critical in navigating the emerging risks and challenges of the new normal,” HNB Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer Dilshan Rodrigo said, commenting on HNB’s presence at the ABA Advocacy Committee Meeting. “Given this pressing need, HNB takes pride in contributing to much-needed discourse on such topics, as well as in representing South Asia’s commercial banking sector at this crucial gathering of industry leaders.”
HNB’s presentation to the distinguished forum, which included senior banking sector leaders from both Asia and other regions, was delivered by its Chief Information Security Officer Suresh Emmanuel.
In his presentation, Emmanuel highlighted the need for a holistic approach to cybersecurity that goes beyond mere technology, as well as the need to employ a long-term view in evaluating the return on investment (RoI) of cybersecurity investments.
“An organisation’s cybersecurity governance framework has to complement its business goals,” Emmanuel noted. “Creating awareness and initiating the cultural change required are key components of this framework. It is important to recognise that cybersecurity is about more than purely technology and needs to take into consideration people and process-related factors. In implementing changes in technology, the people factor is critical, since organisations can face resistance from within the ecosystem, as people would be used to the way that things have been done for many years.”
“In terms of ROI on cybersecurity investments, it is important to fully leverage a system in order to enjoy its full benefits. Organisations need to take a long-term view in evaluating ROI of such investments,” he added.
The other presenters at the event included the MD of Erste Group Bank AG headquartered in Austria, senior officials of Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation – a reputed Commercial Bank in the Philippines, a Member of the Board of one of Iran’s major banks – Bank Pasargad, the CEO of the global non-profit – European Financial Management Association (EFMA) and the MD of India’s financial sector advisory provider – Fintelekt Advisory Services. These presenters covered key issues of concern to the global banking industry ranging from the role of banks in supporting business survival following the pandemic to addressing heightened challenges with regard to Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) in the ‘new normal’.
Recently, HNB Managing Director and CEO Jonathan Alles, was a member of the panel of the ‘CEO roundtable’ at ABA’s 37th General Meeting and Conference while the Bank’s Executive Director and COO, Dilshan Rodrigo was the Session Chairman of the ‘regulator roundtable’ of the same event.

HONG KONG (Reuters): Asian shares were set for their worst day in two weeks on Thursday, weighed down by the latest regulatory crackdown in China and global investors’ worries about a looming reduction in central bank stimulus, while the dollar held firm.
European shares looked set to follow suit, with FTSE futures off 0.65% and pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures down 0.8%, in early trading ahead of a closely watched announcement from a meeting of the European Central Bank.
Analysts anticipate the ECB will announce a token step towards reducing its emergency economic support.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was last down 1.26%, which would be its worst daily performance since 19 August, the last time markets decided they were worried about the US Federal Reserve tapering its massive asset purchase program.
US stock futures, the S&P 500 e-minis, were down 0.45%.
“The global story is looking soft and it’s being hit by the Delta variant plus concern about potentially the Fed still moving towards a taper. It’s an unsettling combination of things that I think is weighing on the market at the moment,” said Rob Carnell Asia head of research at ING.
“Until we actually get the taper announcement ... it’s going to be that sort of environment where it’s glass half full, glass half empty depending on who’s reading the tea leaves that day.”
Strong US job openings data overnight went some way to turning around the mood after investors had been betting the lower-than-expected payroll reading last week would mean the Federal Reserve would delay trimming its stimulus, sending MSCI’s world equity index to a new all-time on Tuesday.
But local factors also played a part in Asian shares’ declines on Thursday.
Hong Kong was among the biggest fallers shedding 2.02%, dragged down particularly by Chinese tech stocks after Chinese authorities told gaming firms to resolutely curb incorrect tendencies such as focusing ‘only on money’ and ‘only on traffic’.
This hurt companies with large gaming operations, and Tencent fell 6%, Bilibili lost 6.6% and NetEase shed 7.4%.
Korea’s Kopsi fell 1.5%, also weighed by regulatory scrutiny of local tech players. In Korea’s case, fintech names such as Kakao Corp, which sank 7.2%, and Naver Corp., down 6.9%, were in the spotlight. Australia lost 1.97% after payrolls data showed a sharp drop in jobs in the first half of August, and Chinese blue chips lost 0.63%. Following its meeting on Thursday, analysts polled by Reuters expect the ECB to announce a cut to the pace of its emergency bond purchases from next quarter but to keep buying bonds at least until 2024 under its main program, and possibly much longer. read more

TOKYO (Reuters): Bitcoin licked its wounds on Wednesday, a day after its heaviest losses in 2-½ months as El Salvador’s historic adoption of the crypto asset as legal tender caused chaos online and on the street.
The coin last traded at $46,560 , having endured wild trade the day before in which it hit a near four-month high of $52,956 before plunging 11.1%, its largest fall since 2 June.
Analysts said the sharp retreat was partly due to investors who had bought the rumour of El Salvador’s move now selling the fact.
“I think there was some anticipation building ahead of that event (El Salvador), similar to what we saw ahead of Coinbase listing on Nasdaq,” said Henrik Andersson, Chief Investment Officer at Apollo Capital, a crypto asset fund in Melbourne, Australia. At one point on Tuesday, the digital currency fell as much as 18.6%, wiping out more than $180 billion from the market.
It was a historical day for bitcoin as El Salvador’s experiment of making it legal tender got off to a bumpy start.
Technological glitches hampered its use while street protests by mistrustful citizens broke out in the Central American country.
As bitcoin wobbled, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said his Government purchased an additional 150 bitcoins on Tuesday, worth around $ 7 million. “That has underscored the difficulty in trying to protect the value of bitcoin as its own currency,” said Nana Otsuki, Chief Economist at Monex Securities. “The buying didn’t seem to be effective in halting its fall.” Amid the trading frenzy, major US cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase Global Inc, Kraken and Gemini struggled with delays in some transactions. All of them said their systems have since been restored.
Separately, the US securities regulator has threatened to sue Coinbase Global if the crypto exchange proceeds with plans to launch a program allowing users to earn interest by lending crypto assets.

Strict insider dealing regime and extensive regulatory powers under new SEC Act


The new SEC Bill was passed in Parliament on 6 September amidst the controversial Amnesty Bill which received greater attention. The far-reaching implications of the new SEC Act are yet to be felt by market participants; many are yet to realise that it cannot be business as usual.  
Provisions of insider dealing has being made wider under the new SEC Act that was passed. The definition of an insider as we generally know under the previous Act is attributed to a person connected to an institution and that is listed. The current Act gives a broader definition to include a connected person or any other person who possesses information that is not generally available and if a transaction is executed will commit an offence of insider dealing. The offence is not compoundable and the Attorney General will decide on the prosecution and a fine not exceeding Rs. 10 million or 10 years’ imprisonment or both will apply.
A webinar with a focus on how directors and shareholders can avoid breaching insider dealing provisions will be a key topic discussed. Discussion on this forum will also include: salient features of the new sec act, other market offences and their implications on trading, impact of changes on new capital market products and services, discretionary powers of the SEC, perils of being listed on a stock exchange, duties and responsibilities of directors under the new Act. 
The webinar on the ‘New SEC Act and its implications for listed companies, market participants’ will be held on 7 October, 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Zoom.  
The speakers would comprise SEC Sri Lanka former Chairman Dr. D.C. Jayasuriya PC, Nithya Partners Precedent Partner/SEC Sri Lanka Former DG Dr. Arittha Wikramanayake, LOLC General Insurance CEO/SEC Former Director Legal Kithsiri Gunawardena, and SEC Former DG/Ministry of Finance Senior Advisor Malik Cader, will chair and moderate the sessions. 
This webinar is for directors and senior management of listed companies, auditors and accountants company secretaries, stock brokers, entities regulated by the SEC, regulators, lawyers and compliance managers and investors.

As one of Sri Lanka’s leading and fastest growing insurers, Co-operative Insurance Company has been in the forefront in serving the country’s underserved communities in rural, suburban and urban areas extending protection and financial stability at an affordable premium payment.  The company recently announced an Initial Public Offering on Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) offering a 10% stake in the firm at an attractive price of Rs. 3.60 per share. In 2020, Co-operative Insurance increased its market share to 4.06% from 3.89% while growing above the industry averages. Further, it also contributed to increasing insurance penetration in the country by – introducing some of the most attractive and affordable insurance solutions. 
Co-operative Insurance Managing Director Wasantha Ranasinghe recently sat down with Daily FT for a discussion on its announced IPO on the CSE while outlining its business model and some of its expansion plans for the future. Following are excerpts of the discussion: 

By Nishel Fernando






Co-operative Insurance Managing Director Wasantha Ranasinghe

 
 




Q: What’s the background of Co-operative Insurance?
Co-operative Insurance was founded in 1999 as a co-operative owned insurance firm with 99.9% of our shares owned by co-operative societies across the country and the balance is opened by officials of the firm. So, we are basically a co-operative owned insurance firm since the beginning up to now.
We are in fact a public, but unlisted firm with more than 300 shareholders – it’s very much of a balanced ownership with no controlling shareholder.
We are in both General and Life insurance businesses. Our General Insurance and Life Insurance entities have an extensive branch network of 110 and 50 fully-equipped branches, respectively. In addition, we also possess 130 service centres island-wide that are operated by our shareholders (Co-operative societies). Overall, we have the third largest branch network in the country’s insurance industry. In particular, I want to emphasise that majority of our branches are located in rural areas of the country. In many of these areas, we have positioned ourselves as the market leader and we continue to be the top of the mind of those areas.
As a co-operative owned insurance provider, we have dedicated ourselves to fulfil the insurance requirement from urban areas to the outskirts of this country where most of our shareholders are present. This is also our main objective as well as key focus, especially given the low insurance penetration in these areas. 

Q: You have announced plans for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) on Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). Could you elaborate on that?
According to the current Insurance Act, we are required to list our shares on the CSE. Although it was due in early 2016, we decided to take some time as did some of the other players in the industry. Now, we have decided to go ahead with a CSE. It’s a mandatory listing as we don’t have a requirement to raise capital from the market.  Our minimum capital levels are currently maintained at Rs. 1.6 billion above the minimum required level of Rs. 1 billion. In share capital, we have over Rs. 2.2 billion including our reserves. In terms of Risk Based Capital (RBC) ratio, we maintain this ratio at around 300 in our Life Insurance business and more than 200 in the General Insurance business. Both of these levels are well above the minimum requirements as well as maximum levels expected by the Regulator, Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL).
Although we don’t have any requirement to raise additional capital, we issue 10% of the equity or 166.37 million ordinary voting shares from our existing shareholders to the market. Accordingly, we are planning to list our shares on the Diri Savi Board of CSE.  Under the advice of our manager for the issuance, the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka (MBSL), we have decided to offer an attractive of Rs. 3.60 per share which would be a discount to the existing nominal value per share. As per the current market conditions and recent developments, we are quite confident that our price per share would move beyond Rs. 3.60 following the proposed IPO.

Q: What has been the recent performance of the Co-operative Insurance?
In 2016, our revenue grew by 24% Year-on-Year (YoY) and in 2017, we recorded a staggering 44% YoY growth by competing side by side with multinational companies and becoming the fastest growing insurance company in the local insurance industry that year. We achieved a 23% YoY growth in 2018 and followed by a 16% YoY growth despite the impacts of the Easter Sunday attacks.  In 2020, our Gross Written Premium (GWP) rose to Rs. 5.2 billion recording a growth despite the impacts of the pandemic. In the year, Profit after tax (PAT) rose by 155% YoY to Rs. 695 million and Profit before tax (PBT) grew by 120% from the previous year to reach Rs. 940 million.
In the first seven months of the year, we have seen around 50% YoY growth in Life Insurance business and 6% YoY growth in General Insurance business. In particular, non-motor segment of General Insurance shown a growth of around 76% YoY in the period.

Q: What’s the business model that facilitated this growth?
Our premium charges have been quite competitive compared to our peer; however, we extend a similar and reasonable converge to our policyholders. Our business expanded by nearly 300 times over the last six years mainly due to the excellence of our service levels offered at a reasonable premium. With almost no advertising costs, mouth-to-mouth word has been a key driver of our business growth over the period. 
I would say we have been successful in managing our overhead despite charging relatively affordable premiums while making payments on claims to our policyholders under our business model which is aligned with our objective to reach out to underserved communities in rural, suburban and urban areas of the country.  Despite more competitive and affordable premium charges, we have been able to generate reasonable dividends to our shareholders. We have been able to maintain double digit dividend payout ratios in vast majority of years in operations. Especially in 2014, we paid the highest dividend in the year, at 14%.
Due to the regulatory measures related to COVID-19, we weren’t able to declare dividend for 2019 and the company instead has declared that dividend in 2021 as an interim dividend of Rs. 1.15 per share. Further, we declared final dividend of Rs. 0.75 per share in 2021. Overall, we have been able to pay dividends above treasury bill rates for our shareholders throughout our history illustrating a good dividend track record.

Q: What are some of your plans for the immediate future?
Well, currently, our General Insurance firm acts as the holding company in addition to running the General Insurance operations while the Life Insurance comes under the holding company as a fully owned subsidiary. However, we have sought the permission from the IRSCL to restructure our corporate structure one year back and the approval is still pending. 
Under this proposed restructuring process, we intend to establish Co-operative Insurance Company as the holding company and to spin off the General Insurance Business to a different entity under the holding company. 
This would grant us more freedom in decision-making allowing us to make more prudent investment decisions. 

Q: What’s your opinion on the current status of the industry and the way forward in particular given very low penetration levels even below the regional peers?
 My feeling is that the insurance industry is not a matured market, the market potential is huge and this is an ever-developing market. Now the industry is shaping its strategies to be more affordable and more personalised. With the digital disruption, the insurance industry makes more progress by reaching customers with more cost-effective ways and brings them to financial inclusivity with new risk management products. 
We have seen good progress with our strategies; we are growing at a high rate; we are continuing; we are starving with our service ethos to be an organisation that will stand united with its customers to the very end.

TOKYO (Reuters): Global stocks inched higher on Tuesday to a record high for the eight straight session as investors wagered the US Federal Reserve is likely to delay the start of tapering its asset purchases after the soft US jobs data.
Japanese shares extended their bull run on hopes the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will compile additional economic stimulus and easily win an upcoming general election after the country’s unpopular Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he would quit. 
Tokyo’s Nikkei rallied as much as 1.3%, moving past the psychological barrier of 30,000 for the first time since April, also helped by a reshuffle in the Nikkei.
Mainland Chinese shares were little changed in early trade while MSCI’s ex-Japan Asian-Pacific index was down 0.1%
The world’s shares, measured by MSCI’s gauge of 50 markets, tacked on 0.1% to log its eighth consecutive day of gains to record highs.
The latest rally, which started after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish speech at Jackson Hole Symposium late last month, received a further boost from a surprisingly soft US payrolls report on Friday.
The US economy created 235,000 jobs in August, the fewest in seven months as hiring in the leisure and hospitality sector stalled, reducing expectations of an early tapering by the Fed. read more
That was way below economists’ forecast of 728,000.
“It’s the service sector that is losing steam and that clearly shows the impact of Delta variant. And the Fed has no reason to insist on tapering this year if the Delta variant is having an impact. After all its policy moves are contingent on job recovery,” said Norihiro Fujito, Chief Investment Strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
US S&P 500 futures were 0.1% higher from Friday’s close after the US holiday on Monday. Bond prices eased slightly, pushing up their yields, with the 10-year US Treasuries yielding 1.339%, up 1.3 basis points.
In the currency market, the euro changed hands at $ 1.1884, a tad below Friday’s one-month peak of $ 1.1909 while the yen was little moved at 109.76 yen to the dollar.
The Australian dollar fetched $ 0.7455, not far from its 1-1/2-month high of $0.74775 set on Friday. The immediate focus is on the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy meeting later in the day and on whether it will stick to its plan to start tapering its bond purchase this month.
Oil prices fell after Saudi Arabia’s sharp cuts to crude contract prices for Asia revived concerns over the demand outlook.
US crude futures dropped 0.6% to $68.90 per barrel.

LONDON (Reuters): Global reinsurance rates are likely to continue rising next year after several years of increases, though the pace of increase may slow, ratings analysts said yesterday.
Reinsurance rates have been rising in the past few years after natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, as well as from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We expect this (price) trend to continue,” Moody’s insurance credit analyst Helena Kingsley-Tomkins told a media briefing, adding that she expects rate increases in the “low to mid-single digit” percentage range in 2022.
Reinsurance rates for sectors hit hard by recent losses such as cyber and property catastrophe could face “easily double-digit” rises next year, Robert Mazzuoli, director, insurance at Fitch told a separate briefing.
Insurers and reinsurers face the risk of future natural catastrophes, with climate change making them harder to predict. Moody’s said demand for insurance and reinsurance is also rising as the global economy recovers.
But strong competition in the sector could keep a lid on rate increases, analysts said.
Claims inflation means risk-adjusted, rather than nominal, reinsurance rates could remain flat, Mazzuoli added. Supply chain bottlenecks and rises in raw material prices have pushed up the cost of repairs.
Moody’s raised its outlook on global reinsurers to stable from negative on Tuesday, citing rising premium rates amid a global economic rebound. Fitch also said the outlook for the sector was improving due to higher prices, an economic rebound and lower pandemic-related losses.
Reinsurers share the burden of large losses, such as from hurricanes, with insurers, in return for part of the premium.
Insurance losses as a result of the pandemic have amounted to around $ 37 billion so far, Kingsley-Tomkins said, far below initial industry projections of as much as $ 100 billion.
The ratings agencies usually update their outlooks ahead of an annual reinsurance event in Monte Carlo each September. The event is taking place virtually this year.
Global property and casualty (P&C) insurance premiums are set to more than double to $ 4.3 trillion in 2040 from $ 1.8 trillion in 2020 as the sector shifts from lower-risk motor insurance towards higher-risk property and liability lines, the Swiss Re Institute forecast this week.

Janashakthi Life Director / CEO Ravi Liyanage handing over the equipment to Senior Lecturer in Medicine and Hon. Consultant Physician, Colombo South Teaching Hospital – Kalubowila, Dr. Shehan Silva representing Janashakthi Foundation
 

As a forerunner in Sri Lanka’s insurance industry for over 26 years, Janashakthi Insurance PLC recently revealed plans to revolutionise the industry. 
Sri Lanka’s life insurance with a less than 1% penetration presents an enormous potential for the industry players as well as the development of the country. With the spread of the COVID-19 disease, Sri Lankans have become more aware of risks in life, thereby, showing an increased interest towards life insurance policies. 
As a member of Janashakthi Group, the leading life insurer plans to support much-needed financial support with innovative life insurance solutions that will support the community to navigate these challenging times better. Janashakthi Insurance PLC Director/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ravi Liyanage recently sat down with Daily FT to discuss the firm’s plans to revolutionise the country’s life insurance in the current context. Following are excerpts of the discussion: 

By Nishel Fernando






Janashakthi Life Director/CEO Ravi Liyanage 

 
 




Q: How does Janashakthi Insurance PLC plan to revolutionise the insurance industry?
Janashakthi is looking at revolutionising the industry to be an innovative insurance provider in the country. We are mapping the innovation as a group strategy for the organisation in many folds.
Firstly, we are looking at innovation in our products portfolio. So, we are in the process of creatively identifying the gaps in the market including both consumer and industrial markets, to find a gap and fulfil it innovatively where other insurance providers haven’t looked at. We are also looking at providing solutions that are innovative and unique. The innovation-led product development will be one key strategy to revolutionise the industry. 
We will also utilise technology to innovate key processes, which means technology will be used extensively to deploy our sales force effectively, because insurance policies are still sold, not bought in the local industry. We will continue to deploy our sales team effectively and empower them with innovative ways of supporting the community. 
When it comes to customer service; we are looking at technology-led innovation in order to manage the customer touchpoints, thereby, we can identify gaps in service delivery in these customer touch points and we will adopt technology to deliver solutions for those touch points. 

Q: What has been the progress of this journey so far?
We are seeing a very promising development so far and our strong performance is a testament to the success of our growth journey and strategy. When you look at the first quarter, we have outperformed industry average in main KPIs. In the second quarter, if you look at our growth business-wise or first-year premium-wise, we have outperformed two insurers who are in the same league with us. Further, we have outperformed and moved our market share in first-year premiums by two market positions in the period. This illustrates our innovative business approach is yielding results, although, the real payoff will only come to play in 2022. 

Q: What are the innovations introduced by Janashakthi Life to tackle the COVID-19 situation?
 Under the context of the current pandemic situation, we were the first insurer to come with a very comprehensive insurance policy and we also updated certain existing products extending their cover in terms of death. 
In mid last year, we launched a very comprehensive COVID-19 product (Janashakthi COVID guard) that covers not only life or death per say, but also other COVID-19 related implications such as quarantines, hospitalisations, PCR tests and so on. We were the first to introduce such a comprehensive policy to the market and this remains the only comprehensive COVID-19 product available in the market. 

Q: How has COVID-19 disrupted Sri Lanka’s life insurance market?
The demand for innovative solutions to ensure the financial stability due to COVID-19 related challenges remains very high at the moment and it is getting enhanced under current market conditions. We have also seen a growth in demand for other products, because, by and large, consumers have understood that there’s a risk to life.
I must say that the risk awareness has been much greater, so the other products also grew with many innovative changes we brought into products and processes we adopted. 

Q: What would be the role of Janashakthi Life to rebuild the economy post-COVID-19 to ensure business continuity and economic stability in the country?
 As we continue to navigate this challenging economic landscape, it is important that we remain resilient. As a purpose-driven insurer, we will continue to provide solutions that cater to the protection needs of Sri Lankans. In addition, we have restructured our distribution landscape with a focus on geographic expansion to reach out to the market aggressively with a combination of physical presence as well as a strong digital interface. We aim to provide more employment opportunities with our robust expansion plans with internally generated funds, creating a greater contribution to the country’s GDP.
Furthermore, as a Group we have activated several initiatives to support the nation’s battle against COVID-19 through our philanthropic arm, the Janashakthi Foundation. Janashakthi Foundation together with its Group companies – First Capital Holdings PLC, Janashakthi Insurance PLC, Orient Finance PLC and Kelsey Developments PLC has been playing an active role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning of the lockdown in Sri Lanka in 2020. We recently donated essential intensive care unit equipment such as ventilators, multipara monitors and oxygen therapy machines to several national hospitals island-wide and will continue these relief initiatives to support the authorities combat the ongoing COVID-19-related challenges. 
The philanthropic arm of the Group was initiated to continue our journey in supporting the nation and local communities. As such, the Janashakthi Foundation drives its vision of helping people and communities grow under its three pillars; sports, education and community development, and will continue to empower our communities and support the nation.

People’s Insurance PLC, a part of People’s Leasing and People’s Bank Group, has become one of the pioneers in Sri Lanka’s general insurance industry, with its swift adoption to operate in the new normal environment that emerged with the COVID-19 pandemic, in ensuring its customer base receives an uninterrupted and increasingly value-adding service. People’s Insurance PLC Chairman Isuru Balapatabendi discusses the company’s journey, the strategy adopted amidst the pandemic and some future plans of the firm in this interview: 

By Nishel Fernando






People’s Insurance Chairman Isuru Balapatabendi

 




Q: As a leading general insurance company, how has People’s Insurance PLC evolved since its inception in becoming one of the most profitable firms in an intensely competitive industry?
People’s Insurance was initially founded by People’s Leasing PLC as a captive arm of the financial Group led by People’s Bank. As a Group, we are in fact the largest player in the country’s financial sector with a combined customer-base of over 14 million and with an asset base over Rs. 2.3 trillion.
Although at the initial stage we were catering only to the clientele of People’s Leasing in handling their insurance policies and other requirements, later we moved beyond captive business operations as the Group decided to expand further under a multi-channel strategy that we adopted, covering bancassurance, corporate and national sales segments and so on.  At the inception within a short-span of time, we went to achieve Rs. 1 billion in Gross Written Premiums (GWP) and into the second year in operation, we were able to post Rs. 72 million in profits. 
Later we also introduced one of the most effective mechanisms in claims handling for our motor insurance policyholders termed ‘call and go’. With this mechanism coming into operation, we were able to offer a superior service to our clientele. The captive segment still accounts for significant part of our business, but we are also focusing on expanding the non-captive business.
In order to expand the non-captive business, we are in the process of developing and introducing unique products. We have a very active Research and Development team in place, which identifies the current and emerging demand as well as trends of the population. So when the lifestyle of a customer changes, we are there with them.

Q: What are the key general life insurance products offered by People’s Insurance?
 We provide all general insurance requirements of our personal, corporate and SME clients, with an aim of becoming a one-stop shop for all general insurance needs of the population. All our product offerings come as comprehensive insurance packages with additional benefits to customers. 
Some of the unique products and services which differentiate us from the rest includes ‘call and go’ facility, our medical health care policy named People’s healthcare and our accident coverage which is termed ‘People’s Guardian’. In addition, another popular product is the ‘Nivahana’ which is a home policy package.
Our Solar Panel insurance policy is one such new product that is gaining traction at present among our client-base. We have introduced this product in identifying the country’s transition towards more renewable energy mix and to minimise the potential risk element in this mid-to-long term investment. 

Q: How the People’s insurance realigned its strategy to effectively address the implications of the pandemic?
Since the latter part of 2019, we have been expecting a potential lockdown or some kind of restrictions of movement and accordingly, we start getting prepared. We appointed a very effective COVID committee within the firm along with the development of a contingency plan well ahead of the lockdown in prioritising welfare and safety of employees and while doubling up our efforts on digitization in order to function remotely in a potential scenario. 
Therefore, when the lockdowns came into force, we were ready. We have enabled the sales team with electronic devices and customer service app with online platforms, and payment infrastructure were setup. As we managed to reach our customers digitally with least problems, our business wasn’t impacted to a far extent. 
In terms of premium payments, the customers can easily make payments online or via island wide CDM or KISOK machines setup at extensive People’s Bank self-banking units. We will be very soon introducing a mobile app to upgrade customer service further. This would facilitate our customers to resolve all of their insurance-related matters.

Q: What’s the level of preparedness of your company for the implementation of IFRS 17?
We have been working on it in three stages for quite a while. Having already completed the first stage, which was the GAP analysis, now we have moved to the second stage where we are looking at how we can make the transition to the new standard from the current accounting standard. We are working with the support of consultants and hope to conclude this stage soon. Thereafter, we will be able to take required actions for the implementation. 

Q: What’s your message to your clientele as well prospective clients on this day?
We have the most extensive coverage in the industry with the backing of People’s Leasing and People’s Bank network and also the Government has entrusted People’s Insurance in handling the COVID insurance policy for tourists, which is one of the most important insurance coverage types at this moment. So, with the trust placed in us, as a responsible corporate citizen, we always prioritise the customers’ safety and convenience. With this in mind, we have extended a range of services digitally. 
We have also been able to continue uninterrupted services during the most difficult time in demonstrating our agility and resilience.

Offer to acquire 2.3 m shares at 35 cents each draws response only for 47,598 shares


Minority shareholders of SMB Leasing PLC haven’t opted for the mandatory offer judging by the low response.
When the offer closed on 3 September, Offeree Ravi Wijeratne had received acceptance amounting to only 47,598 shares. Prior to the offer, Wijeratne held a 64.4% stake or 4.169 million shares.
The offer was to purchase 2.3 million shares representing 35.56% of SMB at 35 cents per share. Public shareholding of voting shares is 83.65% held by 9,956 shareholders, while there are 4,941 non-voting shareholders. As of 31 March, SMB net asset per share was 56 cents.
Acuity Partners, in its independent advisors’ report, said shareholders should envisage accepting the offer since the Offer Price was at a significant premium to the earnings multiples and residual income valuation methods, marginal premium to the forecasted end-July Net Asset Value per share, as well as being lower or marginally discounted to the book value multiples and the last traded share price in the market. If the share price trading on the CSE is higher than the Mandatory Offer price, shareholders could sell their shares in the market.
Over the last 12 months SMB voting share price has fluctuated, with the share price showing a significant increase from January this year to February (70 cents to Rs. 1.30), and thereafter, it had shown a significant drop to 50 cents and closing at 50 cents on 6 August. Yesterday, the share traded at 70 cents.
Wijeratne originally held 194.88 million shares, or a 16.35% stake, in SMB Leasing. Pursuant to the allotment of 3.97 million shares at the Rights Issue (at 35 cents per share), his total shareholding rose to 64.4%.
The company raised Rs. 1.8 billion from voting shareholders and Rs. 296 million from non-voting shareholders through the Rights Issue.
Acuity said the Rights Issue funding would enable the company to expand its loans, leases and pawning portfolios in the future. The independent financial forecasts prepared by Acuity take into account the present low interest rates, economic environment, competitive environment in the domestic financial sector and moratoriums granted by the Government on loans due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“Therefore, although the company has adequate funding to expand its loan portfolios significantly subsequent to the Rights Issue completed in July 2021, the assumptions used in the financial forecast are based on a conservative and realistic approach taking into consideration the external factors as well,” Acuity added.
As of 31 March, SMB had Rs. 1.83 billion in assets and Rs. 784 million in liabilities. In FY20, SMB suffered a Rs. 65 million loss as against an after tax profit of Rs. 12.7 million in the previous year. In the 1Q of 2021, the company achieved a post-tax profit pre-tax profit of Rs. 25 million.

The currency had firmed on Friday against the dollar after data showed the United States created far fewer jobs in August than forecast. But subsequent moves have been listless as traders await further cues on the British economy and the Bank of England's future policy direction.

Following in-depth research and with a view to addressing current market conditions, AIA Insurance recently redesigned and launched its flagship savings product, AIA Smart Wealth, enhancing its value and proposition to Sri Lankans. The newly designed, Smart Wealth enables you to create, manage and protect your wealth. It combines the best of savings with life insurance while providing a significant amount of flexibility to customers. 
Backed by the professional and prudent investment management capabilities of AIA, Smart Wealth invests in a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds/fixed income investments and government securities which are invested for the long term. The investment strategy is designed to provide customers a solid return on their long-term savings. AIA Insurance’s track record of providing superior returns (declared dividend for 2020 was 9.18%) is further backed by an annual guarantee which is currently at 8% for 2021. 
The redesigned saving solution offers customers the choice of customising the amount of life insurance protection they need. Smart Wealth comes standard with a life insurance cover of 5 times the Annualised Premium, but customers may choose to add more life insurance – up to 50 times the Annualised Premium, along with an Accident Insurance Cover. 
In the unfortunate event of death or Total Permanent Disability, AIA will immediately pay the insurance benefits to your loved ones AND will continue to pay your premium on your behalf so that your loved ones will receive the maturity as you intended. This is a unique feature where customers get the benefit of protection and maturity in case the life assured passes away.
Unlike traditional life insurance products, which require long-term premium paying commitments, AIA Smart Wealth suits customers who are saving for the long term (up to 20 years) but only want to make payments for 4 or 6 years.  The new product also offers, for the first time, a 15-year policy term version (6 years of premium payments for 15 years of protection), providing greater choice to our customers. 
AIA Smart Wealth has a special loyalty reward of up to 450% of the Annualised Basic Premium depending on the Policy Term and Premium Paying Term which is added to the savings fund on the 15th and 20th year for 20-year Policy Terms and at maturity for 10- and 15-year Policy Terms. This Loyalty Reward enhances your savings and allows you to build a solid investment for your needs.
The choice and flexibility continue even after maturity. Not all of us want our funds as a lumpsum, so AIA Smart Wealth, after maturity, allows you to receive your savings as a growing monthly income for a period of 5 to 30 years. This monthly option is ideal for people looking for a retirement solution or to provide a monthly income to a loved one. This monthly income is further increased by AIA’s unique Dividend Booster feature which pays 30% more of the Annual Dividend Rate.  
These are just a few of the many benefits offered by this product, not to forget the annually guaranteed dividend payment that AIA customers receive, with a track record of consistently being above the promised amount. AIA Smart Wealth is brought to you by AIA Sri Lanka, a leader in life insurance, providing health, pensions and savings solutions and the Best Life Insurance Company in Sri Lanka for 2019 and 2020 (according to Global Banking and Finance Review).

Powering ahead with 20 years of operational excellence, Sri Lanka’s fastest growing, and most innovative life insurer Softlogic Life continues with its commitment to revolutionising the life insurance sector. 
The company has proven its mettle as a key player in the insurance landscape as a brand that is constantly improving and enhancing the Sri Lankan quality of life and is currently the third largest life insurer in Sri Lanka surpassing much bigger players within a short span of time. 
Affirming its potential for indelible growth, the company recently recorded a superior first half performance in a pandemic-affected business landscape, posting Gross Written Premium (GWP) of Rs. 9,183 million during the six months ending 30 June with a marked increase in top-line growth of 43% compared to the corresponding period of last year. The company also stood firmly with its policyholders in the face of the pandemic paying COVID claims of Rs. 247 million for this particular period. 
“Our job as a life insurer is to best preserve the interests of the people who trust us to be there for them during the more difficult times in their lives. This conviction drives us each and every day to stand by the great responsibility for the 1.5 million plus lives entrusted to us. Our team puts in a lot of passion and energy into finding innovative product propositions to help Sri Lankans across all different economic backgrounds to be able to afford insurance, because we strongly believe that is it is a vital necessity in today’s complex context,” remarked Softlogic Life PLC Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed.
The company was recently honoured among the Top 100 Best Global MDRT companies in the world by the premier global association for finance professionals, Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT). It is also the only Sri Lankan company on the list this year, producing 170 MDRT members in 2020. 
Further attesting Softlogic Life’s deep commitment to protect and empower its people as its greatest asset, the company was recently honoured as one of the Best Large Workplaces in Asia during 2021. The victory also marked Softlogic Life’s fifth year as an organisation recognised as a Great Place to Work and its induction into GPTW’s illustrious Hall of Fame, a unique feat only a handful of organisations in the country have gone on to achieve.
From completely transforming the way insurance is communicated to driving people to pursue their passions and live a greater quality life, Softlogic Life has breathed in new life to a once stagnating life insurance landscape. 
The company has embraced creativity and disruptive innovation such as one-day claims settlement, a worldwide cashless hospital settlement product, introducing Sri Lanka to its very first micro insurance solution via a partnership with Sri Lanka Postal Services plus many more such industry firsts all in a bid to elevate the standards of Sri Lanka by bringing people closer to world-class products and solutions.

REUTERS: A rally in China shares pushed an index of emerging market shares to six-week highs on Monday, while a dollar lingering near one-month low gave a lift to emerging currencies.
MSCI's Asia-heavy gauge of EM shares rose 0.6% as Chinese blue-chips rose almost 2% as the country's plan to set up a new stock exchange in Beijing boosted hopes of support to technologically innovative small- and medium-size enterprises.
Overall optimism was high as weak US jobs growth numbers increased risk appetite as it signalled the Federal Reserve may not rush to taper stimulus. Indian stocks hit record highs.
“Friday's US employment data substantially lowered the risks of a Fed taper this year, which is playing out well in Asian equity markets this morning,” said OANDA Asia Pacific Senior Market Analyst Jeffrey Halley, adding that heightened expectations of stimulus given weak data out for Japan and China last week also keep sentiment buoyed.
Volumes are likely to be lower than usual with US markets shut for a holiday.
Western European indexes also opened higher, bolstering gains for EM bourses trading in European hours. Russia's MOEX scaled new peaks, up 0.3%, while South Africa's top 40 companies index snapped a three-day losing streak.
South Africa's rand lifted off one-month lows, up 0.4%, ahead of GDP data on Tuesday, while Turkey's lira firmed 0.6% after taking a hit on Friday as a surge in inflation above the benchmark interest rate to 19.25% left investors speculating about the bank's move later this month.
Turkey expects its annual inflation rate to fall to 9.8% at the end of 2022, from 16.2% at the end of this year, according to the government's medium-term forecasts. Economic growth is seen at 9% this year before dropping to 5% next year.

Records 18% overall general insurance sales growth in Q2, significantly above industry averages


Amana Takaful Insurance (ATI), Sri Lanka’s fully fledged insurance company, has announced that its 2021 first quarter record performance has been successfully sustained during the second quarter as well. 
ATI has triumphed Q2, with an 18% YoY sales growth – the highest second quarter YoY growth performance among the top 10 General Insurance companies in Sri Lanka.
ATI Head of Corporate Strategy Rajitha Obeysekera, elaborating on the company’s Q2 performance said: “ATI had recorded a significant growth during the first quarter of 2021, with a strong 27% YoY growth. The continued momentum to witness an 18% sales growth in Q2 is of paramount importance, since nationally, the general insurance market has been on the decline due to the Covid-induced difficulties. In fact, this is a double win for the company. 
“Not only did it continue to grow in a time-period of decline, the company did so while facing many pressures of the new normal: macro-economic pressures, and the subsequent drop in the prioritisation of insurance by the people. We attribute this double-win to our customer-centric approach, and being able to provide our clients with their most desired insurance solutions.” 
In the second quarter, ATI reports growth in all main insurance categories – despite some categories having witnessed an industry-wide decline. Its largest non-motor insurance growth in Q2 was Marine Insurance, growing at 74% YoY for Q2. ATI’s Medical Insurance, the second largest growth segment, reported 59% increase. Non-Motor Insurance overall grew by 30%, while Motor insurance grew by 8% YoY for the second quarter – both segments above industry growth averages. The Fire and Engineering segment grew by 29% as well.
Amana Takaful Insurance Managing Director Hassan Kassim commented: “Our Group assets too recorded an increase of 16% (to Rs. 8.2 billion) in the first half of 2021. Our corporate promise earlier this year, to provide our support and services ‘To Every Sri Lankan, as one’ reflects the new service orientation of Amana Takaful Insurance, in providing peace-of-mind through innovative and customer-centric insurance solutions, to Sri Lankans of all walks of life. 
“We have pioneered different novel product concepts in the Sri Lankan insurance sphere, especially across the motor and medical insurance product portfolio. This has attracted a lot of trust and respect towards the brand, enabling us to continue the company’s growth. The ATI team led by CEO Shehan Feisal, worked tirelessly and I wholeheartedly thank the team for their commitment.”

This article was written to commemorate International Actuaries Day, celebrated on 2 September every year


Just before the world went into pandemic mode last year, our sunny island had the privilege of an extraordinary visitor who was here on holiday. Christopher David Daykin (or Chris Daykin as he is known widely) is a British Actuary and was the head of the United Kingdom Government Actuary’s Department (GAD) for 18 years (1989 -2007).  While on holiday, he was kind enough to meet with authorities to share his thoughts and immense experience.
Daykin addressed a distinguished gathering at a meeting organised by S.R. Attygalle, Secretary to the Treasury and Ministry of Finance, where there were representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, State banks, and financial institutions.  
In his speech, Daykin explained that an actuary is a professional who applies mathematical skills to financial, business, and social problems especially those which involve uncertain future events.  Thus, sometimes they are known as “financial fortunetellers”. He further explained that actuaries work across insurance, reinsurance, pensions, social security, corporate finance, investments, risk management, regulation, government service, education and research.
The former Government Actuary also spoke about the GAD. It dates to 1912 and it is a unique self-standing government department with many actuaries providing a wide range of services which hold significant influence on government policymaking.  The GAD contributes to formulating national policy involving long-term issues, management of public sector finance and investment, issues on risk management and insurance, projecting the impact of population changes and modelling the impact of policy decisions, to name just a few.
He stated that government organisations such as the Treasury, Department of Education, Department of Health, Department of Work and Pensions, Ministry of Defense, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Trustees of Public service Pension Schemes in the UK would come for advice from the Government Actuary’s Department.  Additionally, he discussed some of the more unusual roles undertaken by the GAD, such as certifying randomness of the monthly National Lottery Schemes, manpower planning for public bodies and guidance to courts and tribunals, etc.
Daykin emphasised that the society would benefit from the specialist skills, which comes with integrity and objectivity in the form of advice, as Actuaries are bound by the Professional Code of Conduct.  Having identified that the Government of Sri Lanka does not have any Actuaries working in the public sector, he expressed that creating strategies to pave way for a Government Actuary’s Department in Sri Lanka would be beneficial for policymakers.
He noted there is a small actuarial community in Sri Lanka working mainly within the insurance sector, and he highlighted the advantage of beginning a dialogue that would materialise in a longer-term plans to promote this global profession in Sri Lanka
The ideas shared at the meeting are valid, relevant perhaps now more than ever with the prevailing uncertainly of these times.

(The writer has been part of the actuarial profession and has over 15 years of experience working across multiple actuarial roles.)

Surcharge on DCC payments
 

By Mario Ratnaraja 

Sri Lanka’s leading commercial banks recently announced a notable hike on credit and debit card charges on overseas transactions, causing panic amongst some sectors and individuals, some of whom took to social media to discuss the matter. 
The move means that the rate of exchange at the time of billing for Visa and MasterCard increased from 2.5% to 7% on overseas transactions on credit/debit cards with effect from 25 August. As such, users now have to pay a processing fee (billed in LKR) of 5% on their transactions, including Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) transactions to Merchants located overseas or 'operates' online. Banks revealed that the hike reflects the current exchange rate movements. What exactly does this mean? Who would be affected by the levy? Let us delve deeper into the complexities of the matter.

Why did banks increase the exchange rate levy on foreign transactions?
Bank spokespersons revealed that the main trigger behind is the actual foreign exchange rate in the market, which differs from what the Central Bank has published. While most banks currently use rates used by Mastercard and Visa, which are the rates published by the Central Bank and other institutions such as Reuters, the market operates at a more depreciated value. Hence, the banks incur a lot more as they are unable to obtain specific foreign currency from their treasuries at the same rate at which those transactions are going through. This out of the norm status quo is a direct result of the prevailing volatile economic environment, and more specifically, the fact that the country’s foreign reserves is not at the optimum level. 
Sri Lanka’s gross official reserves declined to $ 2.8 billion by end July 2021. Even though there was a boost to reserves from the $ 780 million SDR (Special Drawing Rights) allocation, reserve coverage is extremely limited to the extent that external liabilities will spread out in the months and years ahead. 
The only viable option for banks to compensate for the higher exchange rate compared to the published rate is to increase the DCC rate. Hence, the additional 5% levy on foreign transactions, which limits the outflow on foreign exchange to compensate for the mismatch between inflows and outflows. 
In layman’s terms, this means that credit and debit card users will have to pay more for products and services they obtain from and through overseas or online-based companies. For instance, if someone uses their credit or debit card to pay for Uber transactions such as rides and food delivery, they are going to incur an additional cost to the actual price of the service. 

What are the reasons behind decline in gross official reserves? 
In addition to the obvious lack of tourism inflows and recent decrease in remittances, the flow of cash from within the country to overseas vendors through unregistered companies operating in Sri Lanka adds to the burden on official reserves. With the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and global mobility challenges prevailing, the country’s return to earnings from the tourism sector and certain export segments will be slow to recover. 
 
What can the Government do to stop the outflow of USD from Sri Lanka? 
However, there is a glimmer of hope regarding the easing of the gross reserve crisis. This is by getting unregistered foreign organisations to register in Sri Lanka to prevent the outflow of USD. At present, the annual outflow of USD through unregistered companies remains at about $ 600 million.
The Government stepped into stem the outflow of USD with the introduction of a 2.5% stamp duty tax on services bought through credit cards in 2019. As the Government authorities explained, the tax increase compensated for the USD cash flow out of the country through digital companies such as Uber. 
In justifying the tax, the Government said that while local companies such as PickMe and Takas paid domestic income tax, foreign digital companies did not, as their revenues were booked in tax havens like in the Netherlands and Ireland. 
In this context, inviting such companies to register in Sri Lanka would curtail the outflow of USD from the country, and hence ease the burden on foreign reserves.

SDB bank Chairman Lakshman Abeysekera


 





SDB bank CEO Thilak Piyadigama




SDB bank is renowned for its dedication to be a leading partner of national development. This commitment has paid off for the bank which recorded a 53% increase in its profit for the six months ended 30 June, compared to the same period last year.
A leading financial value creator in Sri Lanka, devoted to fulfilling its promise to multi-stakeholder groups, including the country’s rural sector, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and women entrepreneurs, recorded an exceptional Rs. 502 million in profits from total comprehensive income from January to June this year. 
This achievement rides on the bank’s positive growth trajectory displayed in 2020, where it recorded a whopping 279% annual profit rise compared to 2019, further complemented by its strong performance in the first quarter of 2021.
The bank’s Net Interest Income amounted to Rs. 3,169 million for the first six months of this year – a 9% year on year growth, while its Net Fee and Commission Income grew up 52% compared to last year. Total operating income grew by 10% year on year for the period, reaching Rs. 3.5 billion.
“SDB bank has been steadfast in its growth and performance throughout the pandemic that has crippled many organisations, and the reason lies in the bank’s commitment to its long term objectives and its innovative mindset which is translated into a range of new products we’ve launched to cater to the needs of our customers during these trying times,” says SDB bank CEO Thilak Piyadigama. 
“Our positive performance in the first six months of the year is very encouraging and we are thankful to all our customers and stakeholders across the island for placing their trust in us,” he averred, adding that the bank is propelled to fuel an ambitious growth drive in the next half of the year. 
SDB bank increased its impairment cost in the second quarter considering the increased risks and uncertainties prevailing due to COVID 19 and in compliance with the stringent controls over NPL and bucket movements which resulted in reducing the bank’s impairment cost by 24% year on year. 
The bank recorded Rs. 108.6 billion net in its loan book as of 30 June 2021, at a growth rate of 6% for the first half of the year, with its loan portfolio growing by 18% year on year. While the NPL ratio was controlled at 4.77%, the net non-performing advance ratio slightly deteriorated to 1.87% in Jun 2021 from 1.79% in December 2020 due to prudent provisioning. 
SDB bank’s deposit portfolio reached to Rs. 98.9 billion (net) as at 30 June 2021, at a growth rate of 6% for the first half of year (December 2020 to Jun 2021), with the deposit portfolio growing by 22% year on year. By the end of June, the bank’s total assets increased to Rs .137.42 billion at a growth rate of 6%, whereas the year on year growth of total assets increased to 20%.
The bank›s strong performance in the first half of the year is encouraging and testament to its growth-centric operating philosophy. In addition, its recently ended Secondary Public Offering (SPO), which was successfully completed with a significant oversubscription, will fuel the SDB bank›s future growth momentum.
SDB bank is on a positive and accelerated growth momentum, with a fervent focus on its strategic growth plan for the next three to four years. The bank is committed to uplifting Sri Lanka’s SME sector, encouraging female entrepreneurship and taking digital banking technologies to the rural masses.  Propelled by its successful performance in a time of pandemic-induced challenges, SDB bank is geared and passionate to continue its impetus to better serve its key focus groups via its growing loan portfolio and keen enthusiasm to be a true creator of value for the Sri Lankan people.

Lions Club Colombo Host District 306A1 recently concluded the second session of the Money Matters webinar series – ‘Money Matters 1.1 – Does Personal finances still work in our changing economy’. The webinar series is part of the Lions Club’s efforts to optimise financial literacy and inclusion around the country. 
The highly insightful session was facilitated by a distinguished panel of speakers including Central Bank (CB) Deputy Governor Yvette Fernando, Asian Development Bank (ADB) Financial Sector Specialist Manohari Gunawardhena, Hatton National Bank Chief Operating Officer/Executive Director Dilshan Rodrigo, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chief Economist Shiran Fernando and moderated by Certified Expert in Financial Inclusion Policy/Lions Club Colombo Host 306A1 (2021-22) President Asitha Pinnaduwa, who enlightened the audience to a wealth of knowledge on personal finance, alternative investment options, role of regulators etc. 
Pinnaduwa gave a fitting introduction to the session with insights on Sri Lanka’s economic background since the COVID-19 outbreak, before moving on to discuss in detail with the speakers. He went on to discuss about the importance of personal finance, managing income and how economy affects personal finance. He suggested that becoming financially literate can help an individual to manage income, make well-informed financial decisions, and distinguish good financial advice and more.
Answering a question on what personal finance is and why it is important to citizens, Rodrigo explained that personal finance in a nutshell is about having financial independence, having enough money to live, save for retirement and invest to gain higher profits. When it comes to investing, many Sri Lankans are used to deposit in banks. Instead, he suggested to look for alternative investment options such as the stock market, unit trusts, lands, etc., where the investor gains a higher return, even though it takes a longer duration to yield profits.
He also emphasised on the need for individuals to focus on their retirement plans early rather than waiting till 55 or 60 years and the role of financial institutions in encouraging customers to look for retirement plans. As suggestions, he pointed out that investing in diversified financial institutions without sticking to a single financial institution will be beneficial for customers.
Fernando, in his turn, interpreted economy as an interaction between different players, including the general public who are consumers and service providers who provide goods and services. He pointed out that the country’s economy is undergoing a challenging period and how it affects the decision making of individuals. 
On the subject of interest rates, he spoke about the initiatives taken by the CB to support the economic recovery by lowering interest rates, which provides an ideal opportunity for customers to invest. He shared valuable insights on how customers can decide their investment plans based on the country’s current economic situation and their personal requirements. 
Gunawardhena, answering a question posed on why people are reluctant to invest in the stock market, said that trust, confidence and transparency play a key role in the decision to go for alternative investment options. She emphasised that the attitude towards investments and financial literacy are two things that matter in this regard. In terms of financial literacy, she was of the view that Sri Lanka has some way to go despite the continuous efforts taken by the CB to enhance the country’s financial literacy. 
She touched up on the regional best practices in personal finance, drawing examples from countries such as India. As for the best practices, she stressed on the fact that education on financial inclusion needs to be a part of the school curriculum and suggested that financial inclusion should be approached from the young ages, so that everyone can be responsible of their money and how they invest it. She also encouraged the practice of saving among the youth. 
Yvette Fernando went on to emphasise the importance of financial literacy and the continuous measures taken by the CB to enhance financial literacy in Sri Lanka. She touched upon the role of regulators in the personal finance segment. The regulators have introduced several prudential requirements, including a minimum capital, governance process including documentation, monitoring and reporting processes etc., to safeguard personal finance segment. 
With regards to the responsibility of the general public before dealing with a financial institution, she insisted on the fact that customers should only deal with authorised financial institutions merely for their safety. She also emphasised on doing background research about the financial institutions before dealing with them and gain sound knowledge about financial instruments, diversification and ‘high risk, high reward’ principles etc. She also talked about the customer protection initiatives taken by the CB in ensuring transparency in the financial institutions’ operations etc.
The webinar also featured a Q&A session towards the end, which resolved few of the common concerns faced in personal finance. The next webinar session themed ‘Money Matters 1.2 – Personal Credit – The good, bad and ugly’ will be held on 11 September.

The promotion promises aspiring homeowners the benefit of fast-tracked approvals under the ‘Speed Home Loans’ feature: subject to the submission of all required documents, loans will be approved within three working days at no additional cost, and the funds will reach the borrower within 14 days, the bank said.
The promotion also offers customers a variety of flexible repayment plans that best suit their earnings, projected income, and terminal benefits.

The bank’s flexible repayment options include ‘Residual Home Loans’ and ‘Step-up Home Loans,’ which have been designed for applicants whose repayment capacities are inadequate or exceed 60% of the total remuneration, when the monthly instalment is calculated under traditional methods. 
Under ‘Residual Home Loans,’ customers can repay part of the capital and postpone the repayment of the balance capital. Under ‘Step-up Loans,’ tailor-made, graduated repayment plans are offered, after evaluating the applicant’s present and projected income.
Additionally, the bank said it also offers a five-year grace period for professionals and high net worth individuals, where they could pay only the interest up to five years and then pay the capital and interest due under any suitable method of repayment available with the bank. Repayment for these loans can be made under an equated monthly instalment, a reducing balance method as per customers’ choice, or under a ‘Residual’ or a ‘Step-up Home Loan’ which best suits the borrower, the bank said.

Expert financial planner NDB Wealth Management is promoting safety as a social responsibility and urging individuals and businesses to focus on being socially and financially responsible considering the current conditions in the country and the world at large. 
Globally, people and businesses are facing turbulent and challenging times due to the pandemic situation, and at NDB Wealth focusing on the safety and well-being of their valuable investors has become an integral aspect of their business.
“Considering the current situation, as citizens, it is our moral duty to not only behave in a manner that is responsible but we have been entrusted with the invaluable and prudent task of supporting and encouraging people to be socially responsible for their actions. The safety and protection of our loved ones are now more than ever our responsibility. We must continue to encourage the adherence of proper health guidelines within our own family circles, communities, businesses and society as a whole,” commented NDB Wealth Management Chief Operating Officer Ruwan Perera. 
The pandemic also brought to light the importance of being financially responsible. Over the years, NDB Wealth has been advocating for the essential practice of financial responsibility, independence and stability. Supporting oneself financially and being independent reduces one’s dependency on government institutions and other related authorities for financial support. NDB Wealth Management through their expertise and experience can help individuals and businesses plan and prepare for financial growth and stability despite unexpected situations.  Sharing thoughts on financial responsibility, Ruwan commented: “It is important to stabilise income and have that added source for any emergency. Individuals and businesses should set achievable financial goals and keep themselves abreast of financial matters so that they can navigate through difficult and unexpected situations. The younger generations should be educated on the importance of financial stability and independence to create a forward-thinking society.”
“NDB Wealth offers a range of innovative savings and investment products have been carefully curated to match every type of client; we are committed to offering our clients the best-fit savings and investment plans that will grant them the financial freedom they need in the long term. Backed by a large team of well-trained, experienced advisors, we closely monitor our clients’ progress and well-being by considering each individual’s financial requirements,” Ruwan elaborated further.  NDB Wealth said its Money Plus, a money market fund, is the ideal account for all individuals looking to sustain their future and step up in life. The fund has the added flexibility where an account holder can withdraw money anytime, without penalties. It is also ideal as a wealth or investment plan which can help you meet your long-term financial goals and furthermore it well suits the busy individuals who have limited time to keep track of their ongoing finances as the return is accrued daily. The earnings are tax-free in the hands of the investor, helping to meet those unexpected expenses.
Income fund is yet another innovative product from NDB Wealth that works as an excellent alternative to fixed deposits. It is the ideal account for savers looking for a higher-yielding alternative to grow their portfolio. The Income fund allows investors to increase their income in the current low interest rate environment. 
NDB Wealth is a fully owned subsidiary of the NDB Bank, one of the fastest-growing financial services conglomerates in Sri Lanka, with the strategic mission to be the leader in the financial services sector.

A trader works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange - Reuters
 

MILAN (Reuters): Global dividends are forecast to rise to $ 1.39 trillion this year, up slightly from a previous estimate to reflect a stronger than expected recovery in the company payouts, Janus Henderson said in a report published recently.
Its latest estimate, up 2.2 percentage points from an earlier one, is just 3% below the pre-pandemic peak.
Dividends, a company payout to shareholders, slumped last year against the backdrop of the COVID-crisis as regulatory constraints and government pressures to restrict payments weighed.
But a strong recovery is currently under way, with headline growth at 26.3% in the second quarter, data from the investment manager’s Global Dividend Index showed.
Underlying growth – adjusted for special dividends, changes in currency, timing effects, and index changes – was 11.2%. On a year-on-year basis, 2021 growth is expected at 10.7%, equivalent to an underlying rebound of 8.5%.
Dividends from companies restarting payments totalled $ 33.3 billion and accounted for three-quarters of the underlying growth in the second quarter, the report said. “Global dividends in aggregate will likely regain their pre-pandemic levels within the next 12 months,” Jane Shoemake, Client Portfolio Manager on the Global Equity Income team at Janus Henderson, said in a statement.
The current “recovery will not be hampered by a weak banking system as it was after the global financial crisis a decade ago,” as policymakers continue to provide fiscal and monetary support to the economy, she added.
Limits on bank dividends had a significant impact in 2020 as lenders accounted for half of the fall in global payouts, but constraints have since been lifting.
In early August, European banks announced billions of euros in payments to shareholders. These included ING Groep NV and Intesa Sanpaolo, whose interim dividend will be subject to discussions with regulators. European Union banks meanwhile have benefited from a strong performance in stress tests by the region’s banking watchdog.
Among UK banks, HSBC reinstated dividend payments flagging higher payouts in the future, after the Bank of England scrapped its remaining pandemic curbs in mid-July.
Europe is staging a solid rebound after a wave of cancellations and suspensions last year.
At the same time, companies continued their payouts during the first year of the pandemic in the United States and in Canada, the Janus Henderson report said.
Booming commodity prices boosted payouts by mining companies, with industrials and consumer discretionary coming back strongly, the report also showed.
Defensive sectors, like telecoms, food, food retail, household products, tobacco and pharmaceuticals, registered characteristic low single-digit growth rates.

Strategy follows recent receipt of FDI from Indian financial sector giant Mahindra and further boosted by recent upgrading of rating by Fitch and company’s best-ever financial performance








Ideal Group Chairman Nalin J. Welgama


 





Ideal Finance CEO Duminda Weerasekare 




Ideal Finance Ltd. (IFL) has opened its 13th branch in Welimada, as part of the company’s massive expansion drive to more than double its branch network, by adding 15 new locations within the current financial year (FY 2021/22).
The new branch, which provides a range of services such as leasing, loans (including gold loans) and deposits, was opened by IFL at Welimada, given the area’s importance as a production hub for up-country vegetables and as the location of the Keppetipola Economic Centre, a key trading centre for many types of produce.
The Welimada branch opening will be followed by the opening of new branches at several key locations in September, as IFL ramps up its branch network on the back of several key recent developments. These include attracting new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from India’s Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Limited (MMFSL), an upgrading of IFL’s rating by Fitch and the company recording its best-ever financial performance in the last financial year (FY 2020/21).
With the latest investment, MMFSL is now Ideal Finance’s largest shareholder with a 58.2% stake, making Ideal Finance its second foreign subsidiary. MMFSL’s total investment in IFL amounts to Rs. 2 billion. Earlier, in 2020, MMFSL secured a 38.2% stake in Ideal Finance, providing the latter the backing of a massive financial giant with over $ 11 billion assets under management, which far exceeds that of Sri Lanka’s entire banking industry. 
Fitch Ratings also recently upgraded Ideal Finance’s rating to ‘AA-(lka)’ from ‘BB-(lka)’ and assigned a ‘stable outlook,’ providing a further vote of confidence on the company’s stability and prospects.
Adding further positive momentum to these developments, Ideal Finance recorded its best-ever annual financial performance in the financial year ended 31 March 2021, emphatically overcoming a host of issues stemming from COVID-19. In this same period, the country’s Non-Bank Financial Institution (NBFI) sector recorded a notable decline, reporting a drop in profitability and a surge in Non-Performing Loans (NPLs). 
However, going against the industry trend, Ideal Finance achieved a simultaneous increase in profitability and a reduction of its NPL ratio. Profit Before Tax (PBT) increased by 76% to Rs. 288.4 million in the financial year ended 31 March 2021 on a year-on-year (YOY) basis. Profit After Tax (PAT) grew by 74% to Rs. 183.8 million YOY. Gross NPL ratio improved to 3.3% for the financial year, from 5.2% in the previous year.
“Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services demonstrating its confidence in Ideal Finance and in Sri Lanka with this investment is a timely vote of confidence on both the country’s economic prospects and in Ideal Finance’s stability and growth trajectory,” Ideal Group Chairman Nalin Welgama said. “The company’s stellar performance in the midst of numerous challenges, out-performing the industry in all key indicators, demonstrates that confidence in Ideal Finance was well-placed.”  
“Prudent strategic changes delivered dividends, as evidenced by this performance,” Ideal Finance CEO Duminda Weerasekare said. 
“However, it is perhaps even more commendable that in addition to short-term improvements, developments undertaken during this challenging period has laid the foundation for a high long-term growth trajectory – particularly with the launch of our new digitisation strategy.”
“The expansion of our branch network will further strengthen Ideal Finance’s presence in key areas outside of the Western Province,” Ideal Finance Regional Manager Nilanga Jayalath said. 
“This positions Ideal Finance well to support and benefit from the growth of sectors such as agriculture, as the country focuses on boosting domestic production.”
IFL, a NBFI registered with Central Bank of Sri Lanka, commenced operations in March 2012 with a clear focus on the rural and semi-urban sectors. Its lending portfolio consists of gold loans, SME loans, personal loans, motor cars, three wheelers and commercial vehicles. IFL has developed a quality lending portfolio, while recording sustainable annual growth in profitability.

Attracting investor attention since it was first announced, SDB bank concluded its Secondary Public Offering (SPO) with a successful oversubscription of the initial issue of Rs. 3.5 billion.
This achievement rides on the bank’s previous record-setting as Sri Lanka’s first Colombo Stock Exchange-listed entity to host and complete a rights issue digitally, with an oversubscription. “It is indeed a privilege and an honour to witness this kind of support and encouragement from our investors,” stated SDB bank CEO Thilak Piyadigama. 
“This SPO, through which we invited existing and new shareholders to join hands with the bank, was conducted to raise capital to activate several of the bank’s plans to empower communities most in need of support, whilst upholding our profitability to do what’s right by our shareholders. Two oversubscriptions during a pandemic, is a lot to ask for, and we are truly grateful to each and every investor who has joined us in our journey of uplifting Sri Lanka’s rural sector and small and medium enterprises (SMEs),” he added.
The capital raised from the SPO will be used to fuel the bank’s strategic growth plan for the next three-four years, which includes growing its loan portfolio targeting SMEs and female entrepreneurship and providing digital banking services to Sri Lanka’s rural areas.
Having gained attention and subscription offers from several local and foreign investors since it was first announced by SDB bank in April 2021, the SPO targeted to initially issue up to 68 million new ordinary voting shares to the public at a share price of Rs. 51.50 to raise up to Rs. 3.5 billion and in the event of an oversubscription of the initial issue up to an additional 20 million shares via a green shoe option bringing the total value of the SPO to Rs. 4.5 billion. This offering was the second phase of the bank’s plans to power its growth trajectory, the first of which was its rights issue last year when it raised Rs. 1.5 billion.
Over the recent years, the bank has successfully attracted strong institutional investors with an ethos of sustainability, (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) MSME development and capacity enhancement. During the private placement of shares of the bank in 2017, SBI FMO Emerging Asia Financial Sector Fund (SBI), International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Nederlandse Financierings Maatschappij Voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V (FMO) invested Rs. 1.46 billion in the bank. This SPO has witnessed the support of ICONIC Property Twenty-Three Ltd. which is a fully-owned subsidiary of LOLC Holdings PLC, FMO, Ayenka Holdings Ltd. and Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries (BIO) partnering with the bank as shareholders.
SDB bank has made a great leap in terms of pioneering innovations via its rights issue and SPO, both which were conducted successfully and completely online. To maintain optimum efficiency and smooth operations, the bank set up separate systems for the process, enabling CDS account holders to apply through the Central Depository System (CDS) and others to apply via a tailor-made dedicated online system. 
NDB Investment Bank (NDBIB) played the role of Financial Advisor and Managers to the SPO. NDBIB since advising SDB bank on its initial listing on the CSE in 2012, has advised and guided SDB bank in various other fundraising initiatives including the successful fully-digitalised right issue completed last year.
The funds from the successfully oversubscribed SPO will support SDB bank’s drive to empower existing and prospective SMEs, whilst economically uplifting the rural sector of Sri Lanka, which remain the bank’s core focus areas.

While Sri Lanka’s financial inclusion challenges are likely to deepen further post-pandemic, neither the formal nor the informal financial sector of the country appears to be in a position to address the issue 
 

By Rukula

Sri Lanka was facing many challenges with regard to inclusion, particularly financial inclusion, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. 
As a business with strong links to the country’s informal economy, over the years Rukula has developed a deep understanding of the pulse of the informal economy, given its fundamental importance to our business. This understanding, as well as a multitude of macroeconomic data points, indicates that COVID-19 is likely to significantly deepen Sri Lanka’s inclusion challenges, including in financial inclusion. 

Trends from Rukula’s own operations
Typically, Rukula’s offering of credit sales has attracted certain types of customers – such as trishaw drivers for instance, who have above-average incomes but who are unable to meet the rigorous documentation requirements of banks and finance companies. However, post-pandemic, Rukula has seen the emergence of a new type of customer for the company’s offering. 
Those with formal income sources and a higher income level, the typical Rukula customer (especially relatively senior/experienced workers from sectors such as hospitality and tourism) started approaching the company to seek credit, as the adverse impact of the pandemic on their livelihoods and incomes have made it difficult for them to balance their finances.
Many of Rukula’s existing customers also experienced sharp erosion of their incomes, due to inability to work because of lockdowns or reduced demand for goods and services as a result of COVID-19. 
The first development (the emergence of a new profile of customers) indicates that the pandemic has likely further restricted access to the formal financial system to those who were previously able to access it. The second (reduction of incomes of those in the informal economy) indicates that those in the informal economy are more cut off from the formal financial system now than ever before. Both these factors imply that Sri Lanka’s financial inclusion challenges will be more severe post-pandemic.

Support from macroeconomic data
The above data is supported by macroeconomic data.
Generally, Sri Lankan banks are extremely risk averse and do not lend to borrowers unless they are deemed to have a very low risk profile. According to the World Bank, around 70% of Sri Lanka’s workforce is informally employed and thus would not be eligible for credit from banks, as they would be unable to fulfil the documentation criteria. 
Given also their relatively high marginal costs, banks often find it unprofitable to process payments of say a few hundred rupees and hence have little incentive to serve small-scale customers. After seeing a spike in non-performing loans (NPLs) towards the mid part of last year, banks are likely to be more risk averse than ever, making it likely impossible for borrowers who don’t have strong risk profiles on paper to borrow from them. 
But as Rukula’s experience has validated, the perception of higher risk associated with this segment of customers is often due to the poorly designed credit evaluation process of the formal financial sector. However, given the need to adhere to various regulations, there is also limited room for innovation in this front for formal financial establishments.
Borrowers who are unable to borrow from banks first turn to finance or microfinance companies, both of whom charge higher interest. Unfortunately, these organisations have been severely compromised by the pandemic with NPLs of Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) hitting a very high level of around 13% by the end of 2020. This implies that approximately one in eight loans are categorised as non-performing. In addition, even microfinance institutions largely provide loans for business purposes rather than for consumption, however critical such borrowings might be for the customer. 
With these developments virtually closing the doors of the formal financial sector to many borrowers, in desperation many reach out to informal money lenders and various unregulated online lenders who charge exorbitant interest rates while resorting to unscrupulous practices to collect dues. 
Even before the pandemic the activities of informal money lenders were widespread. A local study done as far back in 2005 found that 32% (approximately one third) of households surveyed had borrowed from informal sources, of which one fifth or 20% had come from informal money lenders. It has been recorded that interest rates charged by informal money lenders can be as high as 300% annually. 

Challenges stemming from lack of financial inclusion
It is important to be mindful that lack of financial inclusion, particularly ability to access lending on affordable terms, contributes towards other forms of inequality.
Since people are unable to access borrowings, they are unable to acquire critical assets – leading to lack of inclusion in aspects such as digital inclusion for instance.
A recent study found that of Sri Lankan small and medium businesses (SMBs) who don’t use computers/laptops, the primary reason for one-fifth or 20% not using such devices was the lack of affordability. However, if they had the ability to purchase the devices on affordable credit terms, perhaps at least some such SMBs would make use of such opportunities. The same survey found that only a meagre 34% (approximately one third) of local SMBs had laptops or desktop computers. 
Rukula’s own experience too demonstrates how lack of financial inclusion is creating disparities in other aspects. Following the initial outbreak of the pandemic in Sri Lanka, it was found that smartphone sales purchased on credit from Rukula’s network of small-scale merchants in the Eastern Province had increased sharply. This was motivated by the need for children to access online classes. With their parents being unable to afford computers or tabs, they purchased smartphones instead. 
It should be noted in this regard that basic smartphones do not have sufficient features to use apps such as Zoom, which are used commonly for online education. Hence, smartphones with higher specifications have to be used instead and these obviously tend to be higher in price as well.
With prices of devices such as smartphones rising noticeably post-pandemic, combined with decrease in disposable incomes of people due to both sharp rise in food prices and decline in incomes, challenges in areas such as digital inclusion is likely to deepen further. 

Need for innovative solutions
While Sri Lanka’s financial inclusion challenges are likely to deepen further post-pandemic, neither the formal nor the informal financial sector of the country appears to be in a position to address the issue. However, the inability to address the issue is likely to create inclusion challenges in other areas – for instance, in terms of digital inclusion. 
In this situation, there is a pressing need for innovative models of financial inclusion, which have low transaction costs and thereby can provide credit on affordable terms to the poor on commercial terms, without making them ‘donor/subsidy dependent’.

Ceylinco Life Chairman R. Renganathan (right) and Managing Director Thushara Ranasinghe at the opening of the new green branch in Negombo 
 

Ceylinco Life has significantly expanded its operations in Negombo, following the opening of the company’s latest eco-friendly branch building in this coastal city, on company-owned land.
The new building adds 7,950 square feet of floor space to Ceylinco Life’s branch in Negombo, and makes it the second largest of the Company’s branches with a total of 18,859 square feet of space. It is also the fifth building built on company-owned land in the Gampaha District, after the branches at Divulapitiya, Kadawatha and Gampaha, and the existing Negombo branch building.
The purpose-designed five-storey addition to the Negombo branch further advances Ceylinco Life’s Green agenda to increase the use of sustainable energy and conserve resources. In line with this ethos, the building is entirely powered by solar energy from a 57.2kW solar power system that reduces the consumption of electricity from the national grid. 
This solar power system is the second largest in the company’s building network and the largest among all branches. In addition, the building also has the second largest rainwater harvesting facility built by Ceylinco Life, a modern sewage treatment plant that treats wastewater and recycles it for toilet flushing and gardening purposes, and the latest energy-efficient air conditioners to reduce energy consumption.
For customer and employee convenience, the new building has an elevator and a dedicated car park with 20 slots, a Cash Deposit Machine that makes it possible to deposit premiums 24 hours of the day, 365 days of the year, a new customer lounge and private discussion rooms for interacting with customers. 
The expansion has also facilitated the addition of 10 new sales regions to the eight sales regions served by the branch previously. Furthermore, the building is equipped with a new training facility that can accommodate 100 people at a time, enhancing its functionality as a nucleus for Ceylinco Life operations in the area. Employees have been provided a new lunchroom with better ambience and a mini training room. 
The investment of Rs. 120 million by Ceylinco Life in this new building consolidates the Company’s presence in Negombo and enables it to further improve services to customers, the life insurance leader said. The Negombo branch is one of 19 Ceylinco Life branches dedicated to protecting lives in the Gampaha District through life insurance. 
Ceylinco Life is in the process of constructing another green building for its branch in Piliyandala. The company currently owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena, Mount Lavinia, and Wellawatte, many of which have already been converted to solar energy. New branch buildings purpose-built to the company’s sustainable energy model are those at Horana, Panadura, Wennappuwa, Bandarawela, Chilaw, Kadawatha, Jaffna, Malabe, Divulapitiya, and Negombo.
Ceylinco Life operates the largest network of 275 branches in Sri Lanka’s life insurance industry, giving it a physical presence in 142 cities, towns, and villages in every one of the island’s 25 districts.

APB Bank Coordinators Investiture is one of the key annual events in the APB Calendar. However, keeping in line with the health and safety guidelines of the Government, it was held virtually via Zoom for the first time in history.
APB President K.B. Rajapaksa addressing the coordinators stated the importance of professional fellowship and how it positively influences a person’s life both personally and professionally.
The Chairmen of the four main APB Sub committees namely, the Publications, Continuous Professional Development, Membership and Special Events briefed the APB Bank Coordinators regarding the activities planned by the Council for the year 2021/22 and also requested for the active participation of the Bank Coordinators amidst the new normal conditions. 
APB affairs are managed by an Executive Council comprising of seven Office Bearers, 10 Council Members who are elected at the AGM representing the Member Banks and the Immediate Past President on ‘Ex Officio’ basis.

HONG KONG (Reuters): Asian shares retreated on Thursday, brushing off an upbeat Wall Street lead as the Delta coronavirus variant’s spread darkened the regional mood while a South Korean interest rate hike put the focus on the global central bank outlook.
Investors are mostly waiting for the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium on Friday and what central bank chair Jerome Powell might say about US tapering monetary stimulus.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.60%, and US stock futures the S&P 500 e-minis, shed 0.14%.
Chinese bluechips fell 1.47% and Hong Kong was down 1.32%, as a rally in tech names ran out of steam. The embattled Hang Seng Tech Index fell 2.41%.
A profit warning from Evergrande, China’s most indebted property developer sent its shares down 7.24%.
Elsewhere, the Australian benchmark lost 0.7% as the country’s new daily cases of COVID-19 topped 1,000 for the first time. Japan’s Nikkei was little changed having spent the day flickering either side of flat.
The Asian stock benchmark is still up around 3.5% on the week, having largely joined a global rally as investors look to the Fed’s upcoming Jackson Hole symposium for assurances the central bank won’t be rushing to tighten policy.
However, Asia is lagging the rest of the world this year. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, is sitting very close to record highs, while the MSCI Asia ex-Japan benchmark is off over 12% from its record highs hit in February.
Overnight, US shares inched higher with the S&P 500 closing at its 51st record high of the year, gaining 0.22%.
“Asia would be doing a lot better if it were not for the Delta outbreak. However, we’ve seen at various times over the last 18 months where different regions have led and lagged depending on where they are in relation to COVID-19,” said Shane Oliver, Chief Economist at AMP. South Korea on Thursday reported a jump in the number of critical or severe cases while infections hit records in Vietnam and the Philippines this week.

The tax liability on dividends plays pivotal role in any corporate regime. The rate and method of taxing corporate profits should have underlying economic and legal rationale. There are various dividend tax frame works adopted by countries. Imputation system, reduced rates of tax, exemption system, deduction system and full integration systems are frameworks an analyst undertaking a study on other countries may observe. 
Corporate income taxation in modern days seek to achieve neutrality between the tax liability on an individual deriving profits directly compared to a person generating income via an activity using the corporate veil.  
The ‘classical system’ of dividend taxation has been significantly altered by the new rules introduced by the recent amendment by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 10 of 2021. The taxation of dividends as per a unique formula has given rise to many unresolved issues in the corporate income tax arena.
The webinar dissects various scenarios and the complexities faced by both the dividend declaring company and the shareholders. In addition, tax issues on script dividends, dividends in species and dividends paid to and received from non-residents would also be discussed for the benefit of the participants.

The Continuous Professional Development Committee of the Association of Professional Bankers recently conducted the second webinar of the series of webinars which is part of the Annual Calendar of the APB. The webinar on ‘Transformation from traditional banking to digitalisation’ was presented by eminent personalities from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, namely, Department of Payments and Settlements Director D. Kumaratunga, and P. Senaratna from the Department of Payments and Settlements. 
The webinar discussed crypto currency, its inception, advantages and disadvantages. Crypto currency is another form of currency or an alternative to notes and a currency used as a medium of performing transactions. Crypto currency can take in the form of digital currency, virtual currency and electronic medium of performing transactions. Virtual currency is unregulated and decentralised. Cyrpto currency was first introduced in 2008 by ‘Satosi Nakamoto’, it is not known whether this was a person or an organisation. Currently there are over 10,000 types of crypto currencies introduced by various parties. However, Bitcoin being the first type of Crypto currencies to be introduced leads the market with over 46% of the market share in crypto currency. The objective of introducing a crypto currency back in 2008 was to make payments efficient with no transaction cost, to make instant payment and to be independent of any regulation. Initial narrative of crypto currency had a limited issue of $ 21 million. However, today, the narrative of crypto currencies has changed from a medium of payment to an instrument of ‘Investment’.
Crypto currencies have its barriers as well. The biggest threat is the frauds that can occur through scams. In addition to the technological risk, the risk of non-regulation, lack of knowledge of the users, price volatility and uncertainty are the major draw-backs in the progress of adopting to crypto currency by economies world over. Fraudulent crypto currency schemes are soaring and the US consumers have lost over $ 80 million since October 2020 to July 2021. Since regulatory monitoring is not available there is no recourses for legal protection. Despite all these risk elements there are over 10000 types of crypto currencies people are investing in currently. 
Digitalisation has become ever more important in the current context. The main requirement in digitalisation is trust. A gradual build-up of trust is visible towards digital systems in the market. Though the systems need complex programming and Artificial Intelligence, the user interfaces require being simple and accessible to regular consumers. Digitalisation has transformed the traditional brick and mortar banking into a ‘anytime anywhere’ banking model. 
However, from the regulatory perspective, technology can create new and unforeseen risks to customers, and it is essential that the service providing bank is adhering to strict compliance with the regulatory framework to ensure the safety of its customers. Regulators world-over utilise technology such as Advanced Analytics, Robotic Process Automation, Cognitive Computing and the Cloud facilities to ensure that the service providers are adhering to regulatory frameworks. The future of digitalisation is ‘Open Banking’ which is the key to digital development that would be witnessed by the Sri Lankan banking customer. Open Banking is a concept where the customer is directly linked with third party tech providers. It provides a consolidated view of the financial position of a customer across numerous financial institutions through a single platform. Digitalisation adds value by allowing non-bank sector to access customer data. 
In Sri Lanka Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) would have a digital bank note or an electronic equivalent of cash similar to those researched and issued by most leading central banks world over as regulated digital form of currency. CBSL too would introduce Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) which would be a regulated currency. CBSL intends to introduce two types of CBDC, retail CBDC for retail transactions and wholesale CBDC to financial institutions. There will be no manual process of documentation and it is expected to help drive financial inclusion, innovation, enabling faster, cheaper, cross border transactions for the economy.

The 9th Capital Market Conference (CAPM) is scheduled to be held on 24 August. This will be the second year in succession that the event is being held on a virtual platform, thereby enabling a much larger reach. 
The panel of speakers will feature a cross section of industry leaders, market analysts and regulators, thus providing the delegates attending this annual event with a multitude of perspectives. The keynote address will be delivered by Colombo Stock Exchange CEO Rajeeva Bandaranayake.
The stock markets have continued to prove resilient, a redeeming feature in a bleak and dismal economy. The stock markets have indeed been the saving grace in a financial marketplace where attractive investment opportunities have been at a premium. The IPOs have generated a tremendous response, with the oversubscription of successive Issuances a seeming manifestation of the general sentiment that pervades the market. Low interest rates and the paucity of alternative investment opportunities of a similar ilk, have contributed to the overall positivity of the stock market.
Many topics of current interest and relevance, such as the recently enacted SEC Act, will form part of the discussion. 
The deliberations will also encompass some of the potential innovative additions to the Investment product suite; crowdfunding, for instance. 
Existing products, such as Unit Trusts and even more recent additions, such as REITs, will also be revisited. The creation of an eco-system that would contribute to a more robust capital market will also feature as a key topic of discussion at what promises to be an interesting afternoon of discussion among luminaries.For more details of the event and for registrations, contact +94775837575 (WhatsApp) or shermana@utoeduconsult.com or visit https://www.facebook.com/utoeduconsultevents.

The marked rise in leverage across many economies resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may point to increased risk of financial stress over the coming years, says Fitch Ratings.
“Our Macro-Prudential Indicator (MPI) scores suggest moderate or high vulnerability to banking system stress for 17 developed market (DM) economies, up from nine a year earlier. This is the most since 2013, although still below the peak of 30 in early 2008, and the share of markets with raised MPI scores is just under half the historical average of 40%,” Fitch said.
It said interpreting MPI scores was complicated by the nature of the COVID-19 shock. Higher leverage is less likely to be a sign that credit bubbles are forming, as real credit growth accelerated only slightly (global median: 3%) in 2020. Credit ratios should drop back towards pre-pandemic levels in some markets in 2021 as economic activity recovers. Banking System Indicators have generally held up during the crisis.
Nevertheless, lending during the pandemic went into weakened economies and much of it was channelled towards the worst-hit sectors and borrowers. Policy tightening or a stuttering, uneven recovery could test some borrowers’ ability to repay debt taken on to survive the pandemic.
Fitch said loose monetary conditions and Government support measures also led to strong real house price increases in many markets. Sharp asset price rises may be another sign of greater financial system vulnerability. However, the gains were not typically sufficient to trigger thresholds for MPI 3, with only Germany at this score.
MPI scores may understate risks in some emerging markets (EMs), with just seven EMs scoring MPI 2 or worse, as Fitch’s model relies on real credit growth for EMs, rather than credit-to-GDP ratios, which increased markedly in Latin America and the Middle East and North Africa.

Amãna Bank continued its impressive performance amidst economic challenges to record a strong first half of 2021, in which the bank’s Profit Before Tax (PBT) doubled or grew by 102% YoY to reach Rs.

In Q2 alone PBT and PAT grew YoY by 310% to Rs. 288.6 million and 291% to Rs. 158.6 million respectively from the corresponding quarter of 2020, which was heavily marred by the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country.

The growth in customer deposits was achieved whilst maintaining a healthy CASA ratio of 46%.

As a result of its growth in advances aided by a healthy financing margin of 3.9%, the bank’s Net Financing Income grew significantly by 34% YoY to close mid-year at Rs. 2 billion, of which Rs 1.1 billion was contributed from Q2 alone. Net Operating Income after accounting for impairment closed at Rs. 1.97 billion (up YoY by 14%) and Rs. 1.03 billion (up YoY by 32%) for H1 and Q2 respectively. 
Following the bank’s ongoing effort to keep a close tab on its costs, which resulted in a 4% reduction in Operating Expenses in comparison to H1 2020, the bank recorded an impressive 74% YoY growth in Operating Profit before VAT on Financial Services to reach Rs. 709.3 million, of which Rs. 400.5 million came in Q2. The bank’s aggregate tax contribution for the first half, amounting to Rs. 420 million accounted for 59% of the bank’s Operating Profit before all taxes.
Commenting on the bank’s performance, Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer said: “Having resiliently withstood the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am happy to note that Amãna Bank has come back strong to record remarkable numbers in terms of both profitability and asset growth during 1H 2021. In achieving such performance I am thankful to the guidance given by our Board of Directors, our passionate employees as well as to all our customers, for continuing to place their trust and confidence in our people friendly banking model, which recently reached the historic milestone of 10 years in operation. I believe that in line with our five-year Strategic Plan, which is enabled by our well-engaged and optimised team whilst upholding the principles of our universal value proposition, this growth momentum will be sustained throughout the year despite various challenges faced by the country’s economy.”
On 1 August, Amãna Bank completed 10 successful years of ‘People Friendly Banking,’ during a period in which the bank crossed the milestone of Rs. 100 billion in Total Assets, while enabling growth and enriching lives of over 380,000 customers. Testifying the progress it has made in a short period of time, the bank was recognised as the ‘Best Up and Coming Islamic Bank of the World’ by Global Finance Magazine USA as well as being recognised as the ‘Fastest Growing Retail Bank in Sri Lanka’ by Global Banking and Finance Awards UK.

Allianz Lanka also ensures that any learnings from the program are integrated into the learning and development cycles of their employees, allowing them to be more customer centric. As such, it is expected that the VoC would be an effective way to retain customers and build brand loyalty through positive reviews or word of mouth.
Allianz Insurance Lanka CEO Gany Subramaniam said: “In today’s fast-paced world, customers expect businesses to offer them greater convenience by anticipating their needs and having a tailor-made solution ready. To accomplish this, many trendsetting companies are implementing innovative methods to make it almost effortless for customers to get what they want, when they want it.” 
“At Allianz Lanka, true customer centricity is at the core of our renewal agenda and the VoC program is a part of this. It is an important way for us to focus on our customer’s needs, understand the way they perceive our brand and the expectations they may have for future product improvement. Our aim is to connect with our customers in way that will help us design products and services that will cater to their every need, thereby providing them with a safe and secure future,” Subramaniam added.

Inviting individuals and organisations around the world to invest their foreign currency savings in Sri Lanka and earn greater returns, Sampath Bank is offering highly attractive rates of up to 7% through the Sampath Special Deposit Account. 
Working together with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), Sampath Bank is offering an interest rate of 7% p.a. on 12-month US Dollar deposits of $ 10,000 and above and 6% p.a. on six-month US Dollar deposits of $ 10,000 and above through this special fixed deposit. It is worth noting that this rate is higher than the prevailing market rates being offered by banks on traditional Sri Lankan Rupee fixed deposits.
The unmatched interest rate together with additional returns from any appreciation in the foreign currency in which the funds are being held in is set to enable depositors to beat inflation and earn greater returns on their savings.
Furthermore, unlike most traditional foreign currency accounts in Sri Lanka, depositors can easily convert and remit the funds in their Sampath Special Deposit Accounts outside the country, without any regulatory restrictions, upon maturity.
Sri Lankan nationals and residents can also obtain Sri Lanka Rupee loans against the funds in their Sampath Special Deposit Accounts, up to 90% of the rupee value of the available balance.
“The global pandemic has had an impact on almost all industries around the world. This has made it increasingly difficult for individuals and organisations to find secure and stable high return investment vehicles for their savings. We are delighted to offer the world an ideal investment solution that helps them earn a high interest rate and also allows them to easily repatriate their funds abroad, on maturity, through our Sampath Special Deposit Accounts,” said Sampath Bank PLC Head of Deposit Mobilisation Halin Hettigoda.

The funds can be remitted in either Sri Lankan Rupees or in any of 14 designated currencies including United States Dollars, Euros, Sterling Pounds, Australian Dollars, Chinese Renminbi and Japanese Yen.
The Government of Sri Lanka and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) introduced Special Deposit Accounts as an instrument to attract substantial foreign exchange into the country and bolster the nation’s foreign currency reserves, in April 2020. The CBSL is offering an additional interest rate of 2% p.a., above the normal rate, for 12-month deposits and 1% p.a., above the normal rate, for six-month deposits, payable at maturity.

Furthermore, Softlogic Life maintained a healthy Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)of 298%, well above the regulatory CAR requirement of 120%. Commenting on the financial performance of the company, Softlogic Life Insurance PLC Chairman Ashok Pathirage stated: “Despite numerous challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic, we have performed well to maintain our position as the third-largest life insurance company in Sri Lanka, growing our market share further to 16.3% by the end of the second quarter. 
“These accomplishments were facilitated by the strategies we deployed and the strong execution of those strategies that have enabled the Company to sustain momentum in spite of the prevailing macro challenges.”
Softlogic Life Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed commented: “The pandemic has been a true test for Softlogic Life for us to showcase resilience and the effectiveness of our strategies, responsiveness and innovation. Our process reengineering efforts backed by digital technologies to ensure overall efficiency and business continuity continue to help the company outdo each quarter and drive strong performance even during this quarter. 
“But most importantly our commitment to honour the promise of paying every fair claim through technologies such as our ‘One Minute Claims Initiative’ and finding innovative product propositions to support Sri Lankans across different economic backgrounds to be able to afford insurance has enabled us to win the trust of over 1.5 million Sri Lankans. 
“As a life insurer we have paid out Rs. 2,618 million claims including settlement of COVID-19 claims of Rs. 247 million in the first six months of the year, which is a true testimony to the fact that we are always there for our customers. We are proud that the company has remained resilient in the face of difficulties, and are confident of the measures we have taken to grow our business further in the coming months.”

Rated amongst top 10 in 10 out of 12 attributes 


Ceylinco Insurance was placed in the 9th position amongst the nation’s Most Respected and Admired Corporates for the year 2021 and thus becomes the Most Respected Insurer in Sri Lanka for yet another year.
This was announced by the LMD magazine in its 17th annual edition of the nation’s Most Respected and Admired Entities. Ceylinco Insurance PLC comprises the two dominant insurers in the country: Ceylinco General Insurance Ltd. and Ceylinco Life Insurance Ltd.
Both, Ceylinco General Insurance and Ceylinco Life Insurance maintain their supremacy as market leaders in general and life insurance, respectively. Moving up three overall positions from the previous year, Ceylinco Insurance is placed in the 4th position in HR and People Management and in the 5th position in Quality Consciousness, Management Profile, Corporate Culture and Vision in the attributes rankings. Ceylinco Insurance is also placed amongst the top 10 in 10 of the 12 attribute rankings. 
Ceylinco Insurance PLC Executive Chairman and CEO Ajith Gunawardena said: “We are proud and also humbled to be amongst the nation’s top corporates, and express our gratitude to each and every one for nominating us. As a corporate entity that believes in offering innovative and customer-friendly solutions, our continuous search for excellence in customer service and commitment has enabled us to become a powerhouse of innovation and creativity, where pioneering ideas are born and given expression to become fully-fledged products and services that enhance people’s lives. 
“Your recognition encourages us and now we are even more committed to offering innovative and customer-centric products and services to the people of the nation. Some of our innovative products have reached the grassroots level and their benefits have been enjoyed by people who would have never thought of getting insurance if it were not offered through channels close to the masses of this country.”
Ceylinco Life Chairman Rajkumar Renganathan said: “A core precept at Ceylinco Life is that respect, like trust, must be earned, nurtured and built on through our actions. Seventeen consecutive years of market leadership in an industry that is heavily dependent on trust attests to the fact that Ceylinco Life has lived by this credo. As the largest life insurance company in Sri Lanka, Ceylinco Life is de-risking the future of millions of people — our policyholders and their families — and has never compromised on its mission or its core values. We not only honour every legitimate claim, we do so quickly and unobtrusively. 
“Our generous and longstanding commitments to the community in the areas of education and health have also endeared us to and earned the respect of Sri Lankans from all walks of life. Additionally, our persistent efforts to promote professionalism in the industry has helped change the perception of the life insurance salesperson and also contributed to the respect we have earned.”
Ceylinco General Chairman and CEO Patrick Alwis said: “The Ceylinco VIP brand is synonymous with customer-centricity and this accolade reflects the value we infuse for customers. Our company is founded on these principles and we remain committed to delivering industry-best insurance solutions to cater to every need of customers from all walks of life.”
Earlier this year, Ceylinco General Insurance and Ceylinco Life Insurance were chosen as the ‘People’s Insurance Brand of The Year’ for general insurance and life insurance respectively at the 2021 SLIM Nielson People’s Awards for an unprecedented 15th consecutive year. Similarly, for the year 2019/20, Ceylinco Insurance PLC, reinforcing its dominance in the insurance industry, moved up to the 6th position amongst Sri Lanka’s top 30 companies.

Fitch Ratings said yesterday it has assigned Asia Securities Ltd. (ASPL) a National Long-Term Rating of ‘BBB-(lka)’. The Outlook is Stable. 
ASPL is a prominent equity brokerage in Sri Lanka. The company, which was founded in 1990, also offers broker credit services to its clients. 
The rating on ASPL reflects its franchise as one of the leading equity brokerages in Sri Lanka, simple yet generally effective risk management, adequate capitalisation relative to local regulatory requirements, and acceptable liquidity buffers as indicated by liquid assets and contingent liquidity coverage of short-term liabilities. 
The rating also incorporates limitations from the weaknesses of the industry’s operating environment, including a small and volatile equity market, still developing market infrastructure and regulatory framework, as well as ASPL’s narrower funding base and variable profitability due to its dependence on fluctuating stock-market revenues. “We believe ASPL’s lean management team leaves it susceptible to key-person risk, although this is mitigated by the stability of its senior leadership since an ownership change in 2015,” Fitch said.
ASPL’s revenues are primarily from equity brokerage and margin lending, with little direct investment risk. Credit risks in margin financing are mitigated by a 50% regulatory loan-to-value limit. ASPL applies an additional valuation discount on securities that it deems to be higher-risk, forming a further buffer against collateral risk. Meanwhile, upcoming sector enhancements to address settlement and other operational risks lag those of many markets in Asia, but should help to strengthen industry operations. 
ASPL’s reliance on volatile equity-market revenues weighs on its credit profile. Operating profitability has fluctuated widely over the past few years - although this partly reflected a number of one-off costs in FY19. Nonetheless, average operating profit to average equity was positive at around 41% over FY18-FY21 (calculated using provisional financial statements for FY21). 
Earnings have been strong in the past 12-18 months due to robust equity-market activity. Improvements to the cost base over the past few years should also help to support revenue retention and profitability, if sustained. However, we believe profitability is likely to remain unpredictable due to the nature of ASPL’s business. Ongoing challenges to the economy and sovereign credit profile also raise risks to funding conditions and equity-market performance, which could put pressure on ASPL’s profitability and funding over the next few years. 
Management is working to build more recurring revenue streams under the Asia Securities brand. These business lines are held separately from ASPL, but could help to strengthen the overall franchise if successful. However, execution of this strategy remains uncertain and the plans are likely to entail further investment, funded by loans from ASPL. This places an additional demand on ASPL’s resources, which Fitch incorporates in our assessment. 
Fitch also views ASPL’s funding profile as more confidence-sensitive than larger financial service organisations, such as major banks and finance and leasing companies. The company has raised adequate funding from banks and private investors despite challenging market conditions in the past several years, and expanded funding facilities provide additional flexibility as borrowing needs have risen alongside strong market activity in the past 12-18 months. Nonetheless, Fitch believes the company’s funding avenues remain relatively narrow, which presents concentration risk in times of stress. 
“We deem ASPL’s capitalisation to be adequate, with net adjusted leverage – defined as (tangible assets – reverse repurchase agreements – securities borrowed)/tangible equity – of 3.0x-5.5x over FY17-FY20,” Fitch said. ASPL’s client financing exposure is subject to a prudential limit of 3x regulatory adjusted net capital, and we expect the company to remain within this limit in the near to medium term (FY17-FY21: 0.7x1.9x regulatory adjusted net capital). 
In calculating net adjusted leverage, Fitch deducts ASPL’s exposures to related entities from tangible assets and equity. These are mainly investments in emerging business lines held apart from ASPL but under a common influence.

 3-year bond yield hits 7% 
Money market liquidity decreases


By Wealth Trust Securities

The sentiment in the bond market turned negative during the trading week ending 13 August as yields were seen heading north on the short end of the yield curve and on the back of thin volumes. 
The increase in yields was led by the three year duration as it moved above 7% for the first time since June 2020. The 01.12.2024 maturity was traded from a weekly low of 6.88% to a high of 7.10% and in comparison to its previous weeks closing of 6.87/90. In addition, selling interest on the maturities of 15.12.22, 15.11.23 and 01.10.25 saw its yields hit intraweek highs of 5.73%, 6.38% and 7.28%, respectively, as well against its previous week’s closing levels of 5.65/70, 6.27/32 and 7.27/27, reflecting an upward shift on the short end of the curve. 
The continued increase in the stipulated cut-off rate of the 364-day bill maturity, decrease in money market liquidity, along with the prevailing uncertainty in the market since the bond auctions conducted on 29 July are seen as the reasons behind the negative sentiment. This is despite the subscription level at the weekly Treasury bill auction increasing to 93.17% of its total offered amount. 
Meanwhile, the foreign holding in Rupee bonds remained steady at Rs. 2.087 billion for the week ending 11th August 2021 while the daily secondary market Treasury bond/bill transacted volumes for the first four trading days of the week averaged Rs. 7.34 billion. 
In money markets, the total outstanding liquidity surplus decreased to Rs. 15.49 billion by the end of the week from its previous week’s Rs. 48.32 billion. Nevertheless, the weighted average rates on overnight call money and repos decreased marginally to average 5.03% and 5.07%, respectively, for the week against its previous weeks of 5.08% and 5.13%. The CBSL’s holding of government securities decreased to Rs. 1,174.21 billion from its previous week’s Rs. 1,186.1 billion.

The country’s image as a clean and vibrant financial centre was shattered when a few years ago an expatriate was appointed as the Governor of the Central Bank and soon became a prime suspect in the manipulation of treasury bonds. 
A ‘red notice’ alert from Interpol for his arrest still remains unexecuted. Though currently a Governor is in place, another ex-Governor seems to be very much the de facto Governor, going by media statements, thus undermining the role of the Governor and the Monetary Board. Shortly after the appointment of a distinguished economist and an ex-banker to the Monetary Board, they were forced to resign without any reasons given.  
With the enactment of the Colombo Port City Commission Act there was much interest in the country becoming another Singapore as a leading financial centre. 
The Act provides for the appointment of Commission members and for the appointment of an independent executive Director-General. However, much to the surprise of investors, a member of the Commission has been appointed as the acting Director-General. This is ultra vires and immediately brings into sharp focus the issue of conflict of interest and accountability. The authorities seem to be oblivious to the ultra vires rule, which is a fundamental concept in all reputed jurisdictions. 
In another important regulatory body, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Act provides for the appointment of only private sector persons as members of the Commission but notwithstanding this statutory provision an officer from the Attorney-General’s Department was appointed as the Chairman. Despite the illegality of the appointment, he continues to remain in office, whilst the AG is the official legal adviser to the Commission. 
At a time when the country is seemingly in trouble to meet foreign debt obligations with intentional rating agencies forced to ring alarm bells, it is necessary for authorities to strictly comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of the laws of the country. Foreign investors have great expectations that the laws of the country will not be blatantly violated.

Fitch Ratings said yesterday it has placed the Outlook on Sri Lanka-based Abans Finance PLC’s National Long-Term Rating on Rating Outlook Evolving and has affirmed the rating at ‘A(lka)’. Fitch has removed the rating from Rating Watch Evolving (RWE).
Fitch said Abans Finance announced on 10 August that its proposed sale to Softlogic Capital PLC (SCAP) is no longer being pursued. The announcement has resulted in Fitch removing the RWE that it placed on Abans Finance’s rating on 7 October 2020, after the company announced on the Colombo Stock Exchange on 29 September 2020 that SCAP would acquire 49.67% of Abans Finance from Abans PLC (AA(lka)/Stable) – Abans Finance’s parent – then amalgamate with SCAP’s majority-owned Softlogic Finance PLC. 
However, Fitch has now placed the Outlook on the company’s rating to Outlook Evolving to reflect the uncertainties around the potential for a disposal of Abans Finance by Abans group, which affects the assessment of Abans’ propensity to extend extraordinary support to its subsidiary. 
“We believe the parent’s intention to dispose of Abans Finance is evident from its proposed transaction with SCAP, although now abandoned, and its classification of the subsidiary as ‘Held for sale and discontinued operation’ in its financial statements,” Fitch said. 
The parent’s stake in the finance company has also been diluted to 50%, from 89% in the financial year ending March 2016, due to capital infusions to meet regulatory requirements, which were mostly via its private-equity investor, Ironwood Investment Holdings Ltd. 
“Abans Finance is required to further raise its core capital to Rs. 2.5 billion by end-2021 (end-June 2021: Rs. 2 billion) and we believe that retained earnings alone will be insufficient to reach this level,” Fitch stated.  The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), as a part of its financial-sector consolidation plan, has been pursuing finance company sales and mergers to avoid further deterioration of the financial positions of licensed finance companies in Sri Lanka. 
Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Outlook Evolving once it has greater clarity of the parent’s propensity to support Abans Finance. This could be signalled through, for instance, a capital infusion from Abans towards meeting its subsidiary’s higher minimum absolute regulatory capital requirement. 
“The rating affirmation reflects that we continue to factor in parental support for Abans Finance, despite its limited importance to the parent, as Abans is still its largest shareholder and is involved in its strategic decisions through board representation and a common brand name. However, we rate Abans Finance three notches below its parent due to its limited role in the group and the parent’s decreased shareholding. 
Abans Finance’s intrinsic financial strength is significantly weaker than its support-driven rating due to its small franchise, limited operating history and high-risk appetite,” Fitch stated.

HNB Assurance PLC (HNBA) and its fully-owned subsidiary HNB General Insurance Ltd. (HNBGI)
recorded a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 285 m for the first half of 2021 (excluding surplus transfers from the Life Fund which will be determined at the end of the year following the valuation of the Life Fund), with a Gross Written Premium (GWP) of Rs. 5.7 b. During the period, both HNBA and HNBGI recorded notable GWP growth rates of 44% and 11% respectively.
Expressing her views on the performance delivered, HNBA and HNBGI Rose Cooray stated: “I’m pleased to state that the Group has completed another successful 1st half, recording a notable PAT of Rs. 285 million amidst all prevailing challenges and uncertainties. As the pandemic keeps posing new threats, the Group adapted various agile business strategies to combat the adverse aftermath impact of the pandemic as well as to keep growing and going forward. Looking at the performance of each business, the Life Insurance business recorded a GWP of Rs. 3.1 billion and the General Insurance business recorded a GWP of Rs. 2.6 billion and the Net Income of the Group surpassed Rs. 6.4 billion. 
Cooray added: “It is noteworthy to mention that given the financial stability and positive outlook of the Group, the Fitch Rating for ‘National Insurer Financial Strength Rating’ of both entities were upgraded to A+. The Boards of HNBA and HNBGI remain confident of the future outlook of both entities and the businesses are well focused on investing in growth opportunities, advancing its product portfolio to suit the needs of its customers and deliver sustainable value to its customers as well as shareholders.”
HNBA and HNBGI Chief Executive Officer Prasantha Fernando stated: “The positive growth momentum of the Group continued during the second quarter, delivering a significant double-digit GWP growth of 27% compared to the corresponding period of last year. Although the PAT growth, in comparison to the corresponding period of 2020, has taken a dip, this was mainly due to increase in claims experienced in the General Insurance business consequent to greater mobility of vehicles compared to last year, and a reversal of deferred tax asset owing to the change in the tax rate. However, change in tax rate is a one-off negative impact and will benefit the Group in the long-run.”
Fernando continued: “It is noteworthy to mention that the Total Assets of the Group surpassed Rs. 33.7 billion and the Investment Income of the Group surpassed Rs. 1.3 billion. The Life and General Funds of the Group reached Rs. 18.8 billion and Rs. 3.3 billion respectively. The upgraded Fitch Rating of A+ is a reflection of the Group’s resilience, stability and solid business practices and with effective strategies in place, the Management of HNBA and HNBGI remains confident of what’s ahead and is on course to achieve the set targets for the year.”

Standard Chartered Sri Lanka won the ‘Credit Card Initiative of the Year – Sri Lanka’ Award for the Bank’s ‘2By20 Campaign on Loan on Card’ at the recently announced Asian Banking & Finance Retail Banking Awards 2021. The most prestigious banking awards in Asia were handed over to the winners via digital presentations recently in place of the gala awards dinner, due to the pandemic.
The 2By20 campaign was designed and proposed in Q4 2019 by the Bank, to drive new assets through low-cost channels leveraging on unutilised credit exposure. The campaign target was to achieve Rs. 2 billion ($ 11 m) from Loan on Card (Cash from Credit Card) transactions within the year 2020, and therefore the name ‘2By20’. Backed by the business challenge for a fee-based Consumer Banking Product drive, the Standard Chartered Sri Lanka team completed the campaign with an achievement that was leaps and bounds ahead of any competing initiatives.
“I congratulate our Voice and Virtual teams for their ‘Never Settle’ attitude on achieving this recognition,” Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Bingumal Thewarathanthri stated, adding, “To be able to win an international award for a banking product structured within a set of values from both client and employee perspective is truly special for Standard Chartered Sri Lanka, as it stands as an example of showcasing banking acumen without compromising on ethical principles.”
The 2By20 promotion was based on the principles of customer centricity, need based solutions, equal opportunity and creating loyalty and client stickiness, with the right product; creating a need to use the unutilised credit line in their Standard Chartered Bank card for a lower cost compared to the Credit Card interest.
Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Head of Consumer, Private and Business Banking Aroshana Fernando explained the award-winning campaign model, “We rewarded our staff based on total new assets they brought in above their individual targets. Working on winning rewards based on the new asset balances they created, our teams increased the monthly average Loan on Card volumes over 2019. Overall, the campaign was a huge success and amazingly, their best results came during the pandemic period when point-of-sale spends were low and overall retail spends were declining.” 
He also stated that the ‘2By20 Campaign on Loan on Card’ contributed to 20% of Consumer Private and Business Banking Net Fee Income and 8% to total Consumer, Private and Business Banking revenue in 2020.

Sri Lankan insurance market 
 A total of 27 insurance companies operated in Sri Lankan insurance sector by the end of 2020 with 13 long term insurance companies, 12 general insurance companies and two composite insurers who provide both long term and general insurance services. Eight companies are listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange and six companies function with major foreign shareholdings. 
The economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic created numerous challenges and opportunities to the Sri Lankan insurance market. The public awareness on life protection is believed to be increased due to the circumstances evolved by the pandemic. In addition, the pandemic has improved the level of awareness on risks that can be mitigated through life insurance which again positively impacted the performance of the life insurers. 
Lockdowns and other containment measures imposed by the Government subdued the demand for most general insurance products. In particular, insurance classes like motor, marine, travel and aviation have mainly affected and reported premium declines compared to previous year. 
Industry has undergone certain developments recently in order to enhance smooth functioning of its key operations. The need for robust information technology infrastructures became vital for insurers as many companies have shifted to remote working environment during the year. Usage of digital and virtual platforms enhanced the effectiveness of some of the functions like, customer servicing, premium collection and claims handling.

Premium income and growth rate 
Overall, the insurance industry reported total Gross Written Premium (GWP) income of Rs. 208,250 million in 2020 compared to Rs. 196,472 million reported in 2019, recording an increase of Rs. 11,778 million and demonstrated a growth rate of 5.99% (2019: 8.62%). 
The long term insurance sector generated a GWP of Rs. 102,974 million in 2020, up by 15.98% against the GWP of Rs. 88,787 million generated in 2019. Product innovation, digitisation of operations, remodelling distribution channels, and usage of customer-centric operating models were few of the key strategies used by long term insurers to achieve business growth during the year. 
Premium generated from Decreasing Term Assurance (DTA)/Mortgage Protection Policies saw a considerable rise during the year due to increased loan grants by the banking and financial institutions, supported by monetary policy relaxation measures of Central Bank. 
In contrast, the general insurance sector recorded a GWP of Rs. 105,276 million in 2020, posting a decline of 2.24% compared to Rs. 107,685 million recorded in 2019 and this restrained performance was mainly due to the sharp decline in motor vehicle imports. Releasing the limited new vehicle stocks into the market and significant rise in vehicle prices were insufficient to offset the contraction in new business premiums general insurance business. 
The reinsurance premium income generated by the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF) from the compulsory reinsurance cession of general insurance business amounted to Rs. 3,235 million during 2020, recording a decline of 22.49% against the reinsurance premium of Rs. 4,174 million generated in 2019 (Refer chart 1).
 

 
Insurance penetration and density 
Insurance penetration which is reflected by the insurance premium generated by licensed insurance companies as a percentage of GDP amounted to 1.39% in 2020. Although insurance penetration had slightly increased in 2020 compared to 1.31%, which was recorded in 2019, it is still low compared to other countries in the Asian region. 
Penetration of the long-term insurance business in 2020 stood at 0.69% (2019: 0.59%) and the penetration of the general insurance business was 0.70% (2019: 0.72%), recording a slight increase in long term insurance and slight decrease in general insurance businesses respectively. 
Over the last few years, consumer confidence on insurance and behavioural pattern to purchase insurance products have gradually increased due to increased public awareness and improved services and product developments introduced by insurance companies 
Insurance density reflects the insurance premium income per person of the population. This has increased to Rs. 9,501 in 2020 compared to Rs. 9,011 recorded in 2019, growing by 5.44%. 
As depicted in Chart 2, the value of total assets of insurance companies has increased to Rs. 796,791 million in 2020, when compared to Rs. 696,941 million recorded in 2019, reflecting a fair growth of 14.33% in comparison to 10.55% growth recorded in 2019. The assets of Long Term Insurance Business amounted to Rs. 563,769 million (2019: Rs. 485,121 million) indicating a growth of 16.21%. The assets of General Insurance Business amounted to Rs. 225,956 million (2019: Rs. 205,130 million) and recorded a growth of 10.15%. 
NITF managed to maintain the growing trend in total assets of reinsurance business displaying a slight increase of 5.62% persuaded by the upturns in government securities and premium receivables. 
Expansion of business volumes and rising policyholder liabilities, demanded insurance companies to maintain adequate asset portfolio while maximising investment returns and complying with regulatory requirements.
 

 
Claims incurred by insurance companies 
A total of Rs. 37,903 million (2019: Rs. 35,139 million) claims were incurred in the Long Term Insurance Business during the year 2020 recording an increase of 7.86% over 2019. Total claims incurred comprised of disability benefits, death benefits, surrenders, maturity benefits and other benefits paid to policyholders. 
Overall net claims incurred by the general insurance sector unveiled a drop of 26.88% to Rs. 41,517 million (2019: Rs. 58,149 million). Hence, overall net claims ratio dropped to 49.16% which is the lowest recorded in the past five years.
Moreover, it is notable that each and every sub class of general insurance sector exhibited contractions in net claims incurred during the year 2020. Major factors behind this noticeable decline of net incurred claims are mobility restrictions implemented during the 1st and 2nd waves of COVID-19 which directly reduced the motor claims and sharp decline in travel and tourism industries in the wake of the pandemic.  

Number of insurance policies issued and policies in force – long-term insurance business 
At the end of 2020, total number of long-term insurance policies in force was 3,593,454 an increase of 6.21% compared to 3,383,290 policies in force at the end of 2019. The new policies issued marked 739,784 in 2020 (2019: 734,896) with a slight improvement compared to 2019 despite the challenges emanated from the pandemic. 
Number of life policies in force as a percentage of the total population and number of life policies in force as a percentage of the labour force amounted to 16.39% (2019: 15.52%) and 42.60% (2019: 39.48%) respectively. The upward trend depicted by above two ratios during the past few years continued to maintain during the year under review emphasising on the ability of life insurers to thrive in the market by innovating and adapting to emerging realities. 
 


Insurance policy lapses – long-term insurance business
Chart 4 depicts insurance policy lapses at the due date or within the grace period because of non-payment of premium, amounted to 256,202 (2019: 265,256) policies with a slight reduction of 3.41% during the year under review. The new insurance policies lapsed stood at 70,337 (2019: 83,547) with a significant drop by 15.81% and claimed for 27.45% of the total insurance policies lapsed. 
Total insurance policies lapsed as a percentage of total policies in force and new insurance policies lapsed as percentage of new policies issued were 7.13% (2019: 7.84%) and 9.51% (2019: 11.37%) respectively demonstrating a decline compared to 2019. It is noteworthy to mention that above two ratios were experiencing a downward trend over last five years, with 2020 being the least.
 
Number of insurance policies issued and policies in force – general insurance business 
New policies issued during the year 2020 reduced by 13.90% comparing to previous year and totalled to 2,850,308 and the decline majorly triggered by motor insurance policies. As aforementioned, new comprehensive motor policies reduced and third party motor policies increased and all together new policies issued under the category of motor stood at 2,471,051. In addition, new policies under health insurance business also presented an increase of 3,725 policies.  
On the flip side, number of policies renewed by the policyholders with the same insurer presented a moderate growth of 8.39% and recorded as 3,663,655 and exclusively driven by motor and health insurance policies. Number of policies in force at the end of year 2020 declined by 2.82% and stood at 6,474,623. During the year, policies in force for miscellaneous, marine, fire and motor have decreased by 24.23%, 24.19, 6.92%% and 6.29% respectively compared to previous year hindering the growth prospects of the general insurance sector. 
 
Profitability of insurance companies 
During 2020, the insurance industry displayed a significant financial performance by posting a year-over -year profit growth of 29.26%. Accordingly, the total profitability (profit before tax) of the industry reported as Rs. 41,767 million for year 2020, whereas same was amounted to Rs. 32,311 in 2019. 
Contrasting to previous years, the contribution of general insurers to overall profitability exceeded the long term insurance companies during the year, as a result of a remarkable profit growth demonstrated by general insurance business by recording a total profit amounting to Rs. 23,040 million for year 2020. NITF and Allianz General were the key drivers of profit growth while SLIC also remained among highest profit generators despite displaying a slight contraction in profits compared to last year.  
The profits of long term insurance business contracted by 17.89% in 2020 and this reduction was a result of decreased surplus transfers and enlarged claim provisions of major long term insurers. As a result of this, nine companies engaged in long term insurance business have reported reduced profitability in 2020. Ceylinco Life was the highest contributor to overall long term profitability, reporting a profit of Rs. 8,767 million while Softlogic Life, Union Life and SLIC exhibited subsequent highest profits respectively.  

Insurance brokering companies 
By the end of 2020, 68 insurance brokering companies operated in the market and generated a Gross Written Premium (GWP) amounting to Rs. 28,912 million (2019: Rs. 29,317 million). This total GWP consisted of premium income generated through long term insurance business and general insurance business which amounted to Rs. 1,422 million (2019: Rs. 1,095 million) and Rs. 27,490 million (2019: Rs. 28,222 million) respectively. Out of the total GWP generated, 95.08% represented GWP of general insurance business and only 4.92% represented GWP of long term insurance business. 
Even though the total GWP generated through insurance brokering business recorded a decline of 1.38% in 2020 compared to Rs. 29,317 million generated in 2019, a noticeable increase in the GWP of long term insurance business, which is 29.85%was noticed during the year mainly due to the increased demands for life insurance policies with the pandemic situation of the country.  
As intermediaries, insurance brokering companies have contributed in generating a considerable GWP of general insurance business (Rs. 105,276 million) including SRCC and T premium. Similar to previous years, the contribution of insurance brokering companies towards long term insurance business during 2020 was insignificant. As per the details provided by the brokering companies, only 1.38 % of the total GWP of long term insurance business (Rs. 102,974 million) was generated through them.  
In 2020, 31 insurance brokering companies procured GWP exceeding Rs. 100 million each and these insurance brokering companies collectively generated GWP amounting to Rs. 27,462 million. The remaining 37 insurance brokering companies generated GWP amounting to only Rs. 1,450 million.
In addition, insurance brokering companies have extended their intermediary services in the area of reinsurance and accordingly few brokering companies have earned considerable commissions during year 2020 which amounted to Rs. 463 million. (2019: Rs. 1,551 million). 
 
Challenges for the future 
Along with the disruptions created by the pandemic, opportunities have emerged for insurers to reinvent themselves and provide insurance services fulfilling new social requirements and market needs and to adopt digital channels in lieu of face-to-face sales, accelerate product developments to better align with public demand for protection, as the interest of younger generations in life, health and other protections products has notably increased with the outbreak of the pandemic. 
Beyond the impact of COVID-19, the insurance industry is occupied with other key challenges such as rise in consumer expectations, cyber threats, increasing climate risk and catastrophe events, sustainability imperatives, and vast retirement savings and protection gaps which will require insurers to think bigger and differently in the years to come.

Chairman Gihan Cooray


 





Director/Chief Executive Officer Priyantha Talwatte




Nations Trust Bank said yesterday it continued to demonstrate its resilience in performance during the year. The loan portfolio increased by Rs. 26 billion, recording a 12% growth during the first six months of the year despite the challenging business environment. 
While continuing to provide working capital loans under the ‘Saubagya’ scheme introduced by the Government, the bank disbursed over Rs. 19 billion new credit facilities under its own revival fund ‘Nations Diriya’ scheme which is dedicated to extending financial support to key industries, enabling such businesses to recommence and rebuild their business operations. 
Understanding the importance of assisting the adversely impacted businesses for their revival, the Bank also offered special payment relief schemes and repayment plans for existing borrowers, in addition to the Central Bank mandated moratorium schemes with low interest rates and restructured repayment plans for some of the identified industries. 
Nations Trust Bank raised $ 40 million from FMO, the Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank and $ 25 million from International Finance Corporation during the first half of the year to support the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector affected most by the pandemic. This would help towards the protection of livelihoods and creation of new employment in the economy.  
The bank also raised Rs. 4 billion, Fitch ‘A’ rated, Senior, Unsecured, Unlisted, Redeemable Debenture in July 2021 further strengthening the medium-term funding profile of the bank.

Financial results for IH 2021
The group recorded a Profit Before Tax growth of 49% for the six months ended 30 June 2021 compared to previous year, despite subdued economic conditions experienced during the second quarter.
Net Interest Income continued to decline primarily due to the reduction in the market interest rates while interest rate ceilings introduced by the regulator impacted some business portfolios. Supporting the loan growth and the economic recovery efforts, yields on loans reduced by 360bps. 
A net reduction in yields in the FIS portfolio also contributed to the decline in net interest income. The absence of a one-off interest reversal on moratoriums loans similar to what was recognised in previous year helped to negate the decline in interest income. However, the improvement in CASA ratio to 37% as at end June 2021 from 28% as at end Jun 2020 helped partially offset the decline in interest margins during the period. 
Gains on trading FX increased as a result of FX funding swaps due to a higher depreciation of the rupee during the current period in contrast to the depreciation during the same period last year. The bank also benefited with trading profits on its fixed income securities portfolio with the fall in market rates.
Suspension or refund of certain charges by the bank, considering the current difficulties faced by customers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively impacted the bank’s fee-based income. Cards income declined on account of a decrease in card spend due to changes in customer behavior patterns owing to the restrictions in mobility and overseas travel. However, a positive trend could be seen in trade finance related income with the increase in some of the trade finance related activities.
New underwriting standards and concentration on loan recoveries resulted in positive flows in the past due buckets while bringing the exposures down in most risk buckets, reflecting a 145bps reduction in the non-performing loan ratio. This is also evident in the reduction in impairment charges during the period. Nevertheless, the bank ensured adequate impairment provisions by introducing changes to internal models to cover unexpected risk factors to reflect current volatile environment together with additional provisions made for the exposures to industries with elevated risks.
Containment of expense growth at 2% amidst the revenue growth at 22% is reflective of the cost management culture entrenched across the organisation. Continuation of some of the cost saving strategies and initiatives executed last year along with productivity, efficiency drives and focus on some large cost pools were the main reasons for this favourable outcome. Cost to income ratio improved to 43.7% compared to 51.1% in the same period last year, demonstrating the bank’s ability to considerably enhance efficiency and productivity through digitalisation and new ways of working.
The impact stemming from the income tax rate differential in income tax and deferred tax relating to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 have been reversed by Rs. 314 m and Rs. 103 m, respectively, using the applicable new tax rate of 24%. As a result, the Profit After Tax recorded a growth of 89% for the six months ended 30 June 2021.
The Return on Equity before the exceptional tax adjustment stands at 16.0% for the period under review, compared to 11.73% recorded in 2020. 
The financial position of the Group remained strong as its Tier I Capital and Total Capital Adequacy ratios as at 30 June 2021 stood well above the regulatory levels at 13.46% and 16.44%, respectively. The Statutory Liquid Asset Ratio (SLAR) for the Domestic Banking Unit and the Off-Shore Banking Unit was at 34% and 26%, respectively, as at the reporting date.

COVID-19 challenges
Essential banking services continued to be provided despite some parts of the country being isolated with month-long travel restrictions imposed as a result of a third wave of COVID-19 during the period. 
Nations Trust Bank American Express Card members can now enjoy exclusive benefits and privileges for a range of online and home delivery purchases. The bank has partnered with a range of home delivery establishments as part of the #AmexFromHome campaign to ensure that the card members’ lives remain uninterrupted during the periods of movement restrictions.

A screenshot taken from the ‘Showcase Sri Lanka: 2021 China-Sri Lanka Virtual Investor Forum’ organised by Standard Chartered Sri Lanka and Standard Chartered China
 

Standard Chartered Sri Lanka together with Standard Chartered China recently organised the ‘Showcase Sri Lanka: 2021 China-Sri Lanka Virtual Investor Forum’ to highlight the partnership potential between the two countries and the emerging strategic opportunities in a shifting global landscape. 
This webinar was the first initiative undertaken through the partnership between Standard Chartered Sri Lanka and the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) to promote Sri Lanka as a preferred investment destination and work together to bring targeted Chinese investments into the country.
Setting the background for beneficial investments in Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Ambassador for the Republic of China Dr. Palitha Kohona said, “Sri Lanka has always had a close and warm relationship with China. We recently concluded the bilateral investment protection agreement to add an additional layer of security for Chinese investors as well as implemented a double taxation agreement to ensure that investors will not have to pay taxes in either country. Any Chinese investor coming into Sri Lanka should also note that we have signed free-trade agreements with India, Pakistan and Singapore and that we are well connected to Australia, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa by sea with more than 35,000 vessels sailing past the country annually.”
Emphasising on the timeliness of the forum was keynote speaker, State Minister of Finance, Capital Markets and State Enterprise Reforms Ajith Nivard Cabraal. “There is no better way of protecting investors than giving them the signal that Sri Lanka will take the necessary steps to honour our commitments. Even during the pandemic, Sri Lanka passed the Colombo Port City commission law, which sets the bedrock for the value addition that would take place in our business ventures and business activities with the rest of the world. My invitation to investors from China comes with the reassurance that we will be providing them with new opportunities, supported by regulatory framework, to take their investments to a level that can really make projects very feasible here in Sri Lanka.”
Board of Investment Sri Lanka Chairman Sanjaya Mohottala delivered a presentation to showcase how Chinese investors can take advantage of the diverse opportunities in Sri Lanka across sectors such as manufacturing – specifically in apparel and pharmaceuticals, ICT, tourism, agri and food processing and infrastructure. He said, “Sri Lanka is ranked one of the most peaceful countries in South Asia. With its progressive and investor-friendly laws, backed by a constitution that protects investors, it becomes a low-risk environment for anyone looking to invest in the country. As the apex agency for promoting and facilitating foreign direct investments in Sri Lanka, BOI will provide investors with end-to-end facilitation, and help them set up their business in Sri Lanka in the shortest possible time.”
Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) Senior General Manager – Port Investment Services and Legal, and Chinese Chamber of Commerce Secretary General Tim Xiao, touched on the importance of creating ‘ease of doing business’ for international investors through the establishment of Hambantota’s multi-purpose port. The infrastructure in place holds an industrial park with container, break bulk, RORO and energy services terminals, which would enable the logistic savings on investors’ exports and imports. 
He said, “We are a free port which gives the freedom for industries to carry out their trade activities, through the exemption of Customs within the bonded area. In addition, the port investment services does go the extra mile to accommodate foreign investments through the establishment of the One Stop Shop (OSS) with the BOI together with providing extended coordination services ranging from company registration to governmental, logistics and financial services.”
Highlighting the importance of the geographical location of Sri Lanka was CHEC Port City Colombo Head of Sales and Marketing Li Xing. “Sri Lanka has quick access to a wide range of booming markets around the world and will soon pave the way for Port City Colombo to become a lucrative economic hub for entertainment, healthcare, education and offshore financial services. The recently passed Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill will allow enterprises entering the port to conduct offshore services and enjoy tax reduction policies, making it the ideal destination for foreign companies to invest in.”
Moderated by Standard Chartered China Executive Director, Head of Belt and Road Janet Ming, the panel discussion conducted at the end of the forum featured speakers Dr. Palitha Kohona, Sanjaya Mohottala, Tim Xiao and Li Xing. Representing Standard Chartered Bank at the discussion was Chief Executive Officer in Sri Lanka Bingumal Thewarathanthri, and Head of Client Coverage, Corporate Commercial Institutional Banking in China Jean Lu.

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has been ranked the Most Respected Bank in Sri Lanka for the 17th consecutive year in the 2021 listing of the Most Respected Entities in Sri Lanka compiled by LMD.
With this latest ranking, the country’s largest private-sector bank also enjoys the distinction of being among the top five Most Respected entities in Sri Lanka in every one of the 17 years since the publication launched the ranking in 2005. The latest edition of the LMD ranking of Sri Lanka’s most respected companies includes the largest and most diversified conglomerates in the country, as well as leading players in apparel and telecommunications and some of the world’s best-known multinational companies.
LMD added two new attributes this year to the 10 by which companies are ranked as part of the survey. Besides the two debuting attributes – ‘HR & People Management’ and ‘Crisis Management’ – the survey ranked companies according to Financial Performance, Quality Consciousness, Management Profile, Honesty, Innovation, Dynamism, Corporate Culture, CSR and Sustainability, Vision and National Perspective. 
Notably, Commercial Bank was ranked among the top 10 corporate entities in Sri Lanka in 2021 in seven of the 12 attributes and was the highest-ranked bank for Financial Performance, CSR and Sustainability and Crisis Management. 
Replacing the Olympic Ranking System it adopted in 2015 to record peer perceptions of corporate admiration, LMD used a weighted ranking system based on the opinions of surveyed respondents this year too. The ranking system operates by weighting three nominations for each company by assigning a weight of five points for the first mention, a weight of three for the second, and one for the third mention. The final rankings were based on the total sum value of the weighted scores for each company. 
This survey commissioned and conceptualised by LMD and conducted by NeilsenIQ, covered a sample of 800 respondents who are managers and above in companies listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), the LMD 100 (2019/2020) and Brands Annual 2020. 
Sri Lanka’s first fully carbon neutral bank, the first Sri Lankan bank to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World and the only Sri Lankan bank to be so listed for 11 years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 268 branches and 931 automated machines in Sri Lanka. The Bank’s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets; Myanmar, where it has a Microfinance company in Nay Pyi Taw; and the Maldives, where the Bank has a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake.

Virtual and online banking have attracted heightened attention from the modern business world amidst the current pandemic
 

In an interview with the AT&T Tech Channel, in 1976, Sir Arthur C. Clarke had predicted the following. “We are going to get a device which will enable us to send much more information to our friends…. you can call in through this any information you might want; airline flights, the price of things at the supermarket, books you have always wanted to read, news you have selectively chosen…”
The abovementioned prophecy has already become a reality. In this day and age, we find it is extremely difficult to survive without our mobile phones. While the rapid advancement of digitalisation is influencing almost all aspects of our lives, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace of change. We have been compelled to convert most of our day-to-day activities to a virtual format. Banking is no exception. Virtual and online banking have attracted heightened attention from the modern business world amidst the current pandemic. 
A report by McKinsey & Company has revealed that across diverse global markets between 15% and 45% of consumers plan to cut back on branch visits after the end of the pandemic. As observed in a study by Moody’s, there are four drivers which will determine the future position of banks. Ability to adapt to shifting customer expectations, increased competition emanating from advanced technology, potential to manage infrastructure and cost and using technology are the key elements. 
It has, therefore, become necessary for traditional financial institutions to make investments in technological infrastructure to stay relevant in the context of rapid digital transformation. This article focuses on the salient features of the world’s virtual banking landscape while drawing strategic imperatives for the Sri Lankan financial system.

Nature of virtual banking 
Virtual banking takes place when providing banking services to customers via information technology platforms without requiring them to visit a physical bank branch. This is now called remote banking, online banking, phone banking, neo banking as well as internet banking. Customers can pay bills online, check their bank account balances, transfer money, withdraw and deposit money and checks and obtain loans as well through these online banking channels. However, there is a difference between ‘online banking’ and ‘virtual banking’. 
When a traditional bank provides aforementioned services based on an internet platform, it can be recognised as online banking. The special nature of virtual banking is that there is no involvement at all with any regular brick-and-mortar branches. All end-to-end transactions in a virtual bank take place in digital mode. According to the definition adopted by the Bank Negara Malaysia, a banking business carried on primarily or wholly through digital or electronic means is considered virtual banking. A bank that primarily delivers retail banking services through the internet or other forms of electronic channels instead of physical branches is identified as a virtual bank by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).

Pros, cons and lessons to learn
From the starting point i.e., opening of an account in a virtual bank, the priority has been attached to the convenience and speed. All you need is a smart mobile device and your identification documents required for account opening can be submitted via the relevant app. One may argue that digital onboarding of customers can lead to usage of fake or forged documents. However, if the access to official databases of personal identification is available to banks subject to robust data protection laws, such concerns can be addressed. 
Digital customer onboarding needs to be in compliance with Anti Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing regulations. They should also be within the ‘enhanced customer due diligence’ parameters. Technological infrastructure in virtual banks should be robust enough to detect fraudulent acts.
This convenience coupled with speed in virtual banking have been identified as factors which attract new customers to the banking territory from the unbanked segments. It will enhance financial inclusion of a country which is a key imperative in inclusive economic development. Availability of access to account and banking information around the clock and lower charges and fees due to operational cost efficiency are among other advantages of virtual banking. 
Virtual banks pay higher interest rates than traditional banks. By imposing a relatively low threshold as the approved limit of cash deposits, the possible misuse of virtual bank accounts for money laundering purposes can be mitigated. Promoting the use of debit cards issued against a virtual bank account for day today expenses will also promote a less cash society. Valuable time of people can be saved by using virtual banking without queuing up in a bank branch to execute simple transactions. It will also be a lifesaving factor during a health crisis like the one we are experiencing at this moment.
The inherent disadvantages of virtual banking are the security threats associated with IT platforms. Regulatory authorities can mitigate this risk by ensuring the relevant bank has invested in secured and sophisticated technological infrastructure required for protected transactions. The lack of face-to-face relationships to clarify issues is also seen as a weak point in the virtual banking experience. If the ‘pay points’ to deposit and withdraw money are not easily available, it may also hamper the convenience of customers.

International virtual banking experience
Organisations, which were established in the 1990s like Japan Net Bank and Manulife Bank in Canada, have set an example of sustainability and proven business models for other new virtual banks to emulate. Several Asia Pacific countries have also issued policy papers pertaining to virtual banking regulatory precepts. Virtual banks are operating in the USA, UK, China and Russia as well. In Hong Kong, incumbent banks have progressively embraced fintech companies to provide multifaceted financial services. 
This has served to bring together the customer bases of banks and the advance technology provided by fintech companies to improve financial intermediation and increase inclusion. In 2017 the HKMA announced the plan to bring the country into a ‘New Era of Smart Banking’. As a result of this project, the HKMA has granted eight licenses to virtual banks. The licensing procedure leads to narrow the regulatory arbitrage that may be available to non-bank fin tech companies. 
The requirement to have a head office of the virtual bank, in Hong Kong, to address inquiries and related issues serves to preserve public trust in their operations. Moreover, the high capital requirement, identification of a robust business model and the need to comply with the same regulatory standards as physical banks have resulted in the streamlining and stabilising of the virtual banking landscape, in Hong Kong. Ensuring that carefully designed exit plans are available for virtual banks is also a vital element. 
The HKMA requires the virtual banks to have plans in place which include trigger points for exit and a repayment mechanism to customers and the sources of funding as well. The supervision framework for virtual banks has also been designed in terms of a risk-based policy. 
In the UK also, authorisation obtained from the Financial Conduct Authority, a banking license issued by the Prudential Regulation Authority and compliance with capital requirements are essential prerequisites for virtual banking operations. The ‘regulatory nursery’ concept, introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority of the UK, helps in implementing a balancing act between innovative financial products and consumer protection. 
Under the concept of the ‘regulatory nursery’, close contact is kept with firms immediately post-authorisation to provide support and intervene when it is necessary to steer the relevant firms in the right direction. Close interaction of this nature between the industry and the regulator creates a mutually reinforcing environment for both parties.
According to the S&P Global, four factors namely, the current state of technology, regulation, industry and customer preferences need to be assessed in evaluating the risk of tech disruption in each individual banking sector. Sri Lanka’s preparedness to withstand evolving disruptive technologies in the financial sector can also be measured by using these assessment factors.

Strategic imperatives to stay relevant in the digital transformation
The financial regulatory regime of Sri Lanka too will have to be equipped with the required knowledge and regulatory tools to embrace these new chapters of digital transformation. Most importantly, the International Financial Centre to be launched in the Port City, Sri Lanka, will underscore the need for regulatory readiness to evolve with market developments in this digitalised era. However, it would be prudent to improve the online banking eco system in Sri Lanka, prior to leapfrogging towards virtual banking. Improving the online banking space can be linked up with national financial inclusion agenda as well. 
The advantage of the lower overhead costs of online platforms can be passed on to the people at the bottom of the social pyramid and SMEs by way of small and inexpensive loans. Incumbent banks can leverage their online banking platforms for this purpose. 
Rising customer expectation in the context of evolving technological improvements is another key challenge that needs to be addressed by financial institutions in Sri Lanka. Studies reveal that enhanced online services available to the fintech industry will break banks’ heavy gravitational pull-on customers. When customers expect multidisciplinary functionality from banks and want them to be ‘one stop shops,’ incumbent traditional banks will need more resources to meet such expectations. 
Making seamless services available on customers’ digital devices, while exercising due diligence, has already become a key challenge during the current pandemic situation. Traditional banks, which have already built-up digital infrastructure, can leverage their position to innovate new products for advanced customers, focusing on stable revenues. Since online banking is usually focused on simple retail products, large banks can expand the boundary of their product space through such innovations. 
Public trust in the traditional banks can be capitalised upon in accelerating the product innovation trajectory. Improving business packages available for SMEs by including suggestions related to their HR and fund management and harnessing the quality of the projects will also bring positive outcomes. Existing technical infrastructure will be adequate to go that extra mile provided the management of financial institutions has right attitude to connect with customers.
In addition to the poor risk governance and mismanagement of the respective entities, recurrent failures of non-bank financial institutions are reported from the Sri Lankan financial system due to too many institutions competing for the same small market. In tandem with consolidation in the financial system, it would be prudent to promote online banking opportunities for the unbanked/underbanked populations in the country through these finance companies. These entities will have to have a renewed focus on new sustainable corporate branding in launching such product packages customised for underserved segments in society.
Harnessing online banking platforms, in Sri Lanka, should also be done whilst ensuring that carefully devised cyber security and recovery plans are available to the relevant financial institutions. Incumbent financial institutions will be required to make investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at least in terms of a phased-out plan. McKinsey & Company reveals that banks that fail to make AI central to their core strategy and operations will risk being overtaken by competition and deserted by their customers. 
Research studies have revealed that customers prefer biometrics over passwords for validating payments. Acquiring necessary technology to offer biometric authentication for remote transactions, subject to risk mitigation measures, will also be a requirement for the journey of the Sri Lanka’s financial industry towards digitalisation.
Efficient and effective collaboration with rivals will be another strategic measure. Fintech firms can contribute to enhance competition in the financial services industry. They can also improve efficiency and bring new players to the market. Although the resilient incumbents can withstand the competition emanating from fintech firms, small financial entities can become the casualties. When Fintech firms invade the space of incumbent banks, there will be increased competition. It will eventually result in small banks and finance companies, which are struggling to invest in advanced technology, exiting the market. 
Partnering with these startups, acquiring them and improving internal technological development will be a survival strategy for such small entities. However, partnering with fintech companies needs to be curated very carefully. This collaboration between incumbent banks and fintech firms has occurred widely in other jurisdictions.
Digital financial services can be improved to make worker remittance inflows more cost-effective and secure. Fintech platforms, partnered with banks, can be introduced to divert huge volumes of remittances currently routed through informal channels, to the banking sector. The M-Pesa scheme, launched in Africa, is an example of such a holistic mechanism. The branch network of incumbent financial institutions can be used to implement transparent, secure and low-cost remittance services through introduction of digital platforms. 
The ability to receive remittances directly into a mobile money account will address the cultural barriers which continue to hamper engaging with the informal sector among certain communities. Providing an appropriate digital solution for migrant workers for sending money home in a cheaper and safer manner will be a real game changer in enhancing foreign exchange inflows to the country. It needs to be launched as a cohesive and comprehensive national program instead of a patchy haphazard policy.
Boards of directors of incumbent financial institutions will need adequate knowledge about IT infrastructure for implementing improved digital services. Boards of directors, management and all employees of these institutions should be flexible and agile to move along with evolving market innovations. They need to be educated and well-trained to perform in a technologically advanced and highly competitive industry. Building in-house expertise to make necessary adjustments to core systems, as and when necessary, will also be a positive factor in the long run. 
Along with the commercialisation of business strategies and making investments in digital infrastructure, cultivating the right corporate culture, which supports the relevant financial institution’s navigation through challenges, is very vital. Experimenting with the continuation of hybrid working models commenced during pandemic and investing in skilled staff will also be among proactive approaches for managing the change under reference.
Gaps in the financial literacy level of the general public need to be addressed to enable them to obtain the maximum benefits of digital banking services. The high literacy level and mobile phone penetration, in Sri Lanka, can be used to create a conducive business environment for fostering digital financial services. Conducting more public awareness campaigns about the benefits of virtual/online banking and the precautionary measures to be followed to avoid potential pitfalls also need to be given priority.

The path ahead
Since disruptive technology has become a reality, traditional financial institutions need to act extremely fast to redesign their business model to stay relevant in the age of digital disruption. Boosting profitability for this purpose will be a challenge due to the pandemic-induced economic challenges. However, the winners will be those who are capable of improving efficiency and productivity of services while tapping new customer bases. 
Revisiting the legacy systems to identify non-productive areas will also be a step towards strengthening resilience and fostering a customer-centric culture in financial institutions. While adopting an agile regulatory policy towards digital financial services, it would be advisable to devise a measured agenda towards virtual banking. With the Big Techs making inroads into the financial services industry, competition for incumbent banks in any jurisdiction will be an inevitable outcome. Taking measures to be future-ready institutions will, therefore, not be a waste of time. 
Maintaining close collaboration between the financial industry and the regulatory authorities will be important in integrating new technologies while mitigating associated risks. In this journey towards digital banking, it is important to ensure that the vulnerable segments are not left behind. People who cannot afford to buy mobile devices and who find it is difficult to engage in online banking will still need to carry out cash transactions and visit physical bank branches.
Re-writing institutional purposes of financial institutions so that they are not confined solely to the profit maximisation goal and become strategic partners in the country’s inclusive development agenda is also a significant objective. Bank branches, equipped with modern digital infrastructure and staff which possess the unique Sri Lankan hospitability qualities, will be the right blend for writing a new legacy in the brisk transformation towards digitalisation. This unique physical-digital combination can be capitalised upon by Sri Lankan financial institutions to remain competitive in the disruptive digital race.

HONG KONG (Reuters): Standard Chartered PLC has posted a higher than expected 57% jump in first-half pretax profit and announced a $250 million share buyback, with the bank also resuming dividend payments by unveiling a three cents per share interim payout.
Statutory pretax profit for StanChart, which focuses on Asia, Africa and the Middle East, rose to $2.55 billion in January-June from $1.63 billion in the same period last year, the London-headquartered bank said in a stock exchange filing.
The latest profit compared with the $2.23 billion average of analyst estimates compiled by Standard Chartered.
“We believe that we will soon be back on the same performance trajectory that we were on before the pandemic set us back,” Chief Executive Bill Winters said. StanChart’s profit boost was helped by improved loan impairments, and the bank was also able to release $47 million it had set aside last year to cover a potential increase in bad loans due to the pandemic.
However, the bank released less than larger rival HSBC did a day earlier.
Income fell 5%, which the bank blamed on low interest rates that it said were now likely at their trough.
Costs rose 8%, mainly due to higher pay for bankers as StanChart, in common with its rivals, boosted bonuses to try and retain key staff as banks’ profits rebound.

Amãna Bank, Sri Lanka’s one and only licensed commercial bank to fully operate on non-interest based banking principles, has successfully completed 10 years of its people-friendly banking operations.

Having commenced its journey on 1 August 2011, Amana Bank has witnessed strong progress, which was primarily fuelled by the growing support and confidence of its valued customers, which today counts over 380,000. 
Within these 10 years, the bank has reached Rs. 100 billion in total assets, while growing its franchise to 32 branches, 19 self-banking centres, 5,000+ ATMs and 850+ deposit points through collaborations with LankaPay and Pay&Go, offering a wide range of product and service solutions. 
Over the years through performing constantly, the bank has built a strong track record of profitability and dividends, for which progress the bank has been recognised as the ‘Best Up and Coming Islamic Bank of the World’ by Global Finance Magazine USA and the ‘Fastest Growing Retail Bank in Sri Lanka’ by Global Banking and Finance Awards UK. 
Amãna Bank has predominantly served the SME sector which is the backbone of the Sri Lankan economy, where its people-friendly banking model forms a strong strategic fit. Going beyond numeric, the bank’s core business operations and CSR activities are well aligned towards sustainable banking initiatives as advocated by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG). 
Stemming from UNSDG Goal No 10 on ‘Reduced Inequalities’ the bank’s flagship CSR initiative OrphanCare, has enrolled 3,000+ orphans from 80+ orphanages Island-wide, providing financial independence once they reach the age of 18. All orphan enrollments are guided by Article 2 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which advocates against all forms of discrimination including race, cast, religion, ethnicity, etc. Governed by an independent body of elite trustees of strong social repute, OrphanCare has already made seven rounds of fund disbursement while providing qualitative care for 18+ orphans.
The bank’s mission towards enabling growth and enriching lives, led the bank to introduce its award winning ‘Gold Certificate Financing’ solution, which has served as a beacon of hope for over 50,000 customers, in their hour of need. Further the team’s passion, commitment and engagement towards upholding the principles of its universal value proposition, brought Amãna Bank the valued accolade of being recognised as one of ‘Sri Lanka’s Best Employer Brands’ by World HRD Congress. 
Commenting on reaching this historic milestone the bank’s incumbent Chairman Asgi Akbarally said: “From a humble beginning in 2011, Amãna Bank today has emerged as a fast growing institution steadily progressing towards making a strong impact within the local banking industry serving all Sri Lankans. This journey would not have been possible if not for the support of our stakeholders, for whom I extend my heartfelt gratitude including the regulators, strategic shareholders, fellow Board of Directors, employees well led by the CEO and Management Committee and most of all our valued customers.”
Further sharing his views, the bank’s visionary Founder Chairman Osman Kassim, who retired last August upon completing the mandatory serving period as a Board of Director in a licensed commercial bank, said: “Amãna Bank has always been a dream and a passion for me which will continue to strongly echo in my heart. Amongst many purposeful initiatives I have pursued during my 40+ entrepreneurial years, I regard Amãna Bank as one of the most challenging initiatives while noting that it is also the one which has brought the most satisfaction and happiness to me. I would like to thank our promoters and strategic partners, who invested in the bank by believing in its vision, while also thanking our customers, who have always been our biggest strength and encouragement, especially in the early days, who were early adopters, without whom this model would have never taken off.”
Expressing his appreciation on the completion of 10 Years, the bank’s Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer said: “As we successfully complete 10 years of banking operations, I take this opportunity to thank our customers profoundly for being an integral part of this journey, not only as a customer but also as an advocate of our unique people-friendly banking model. We would have not made it this far if not for the continuous belief our strategic shareholders had in us, namely the IsDB Group, Akbar Brothers and Bank Islam Malaysia, for which we are truly indebted. I am thankful to our visionary Founder Chairman Osman Kassim, Founder Directors, incumbent Chairman Asgi Akbarally and the Board of Directors and Sharia Supervisory Council for their invaluable guidance. Finally, I would like to thank my 800+ team of passionate colleagues, for being the primary enabler of all the Bank’s achievements.” 
Sharing his comments on the journey forward, Azmeer added: “Having witnessed acceleration in customer demand for its digital banking services, the bank’s focus has been on its digital transformation journey with emphasis on superlative customer experience, for which the Bank has already drawn up the digital blueprint in taking the bank to its next level of growth.  As we move forward in the next phase of our journey, God willing, we will continue to work hard to ensure a superior service experience, and as a listening bank, always welcome our customers valued thoughts, suggestions and feedback.”
Amana Bank PLC is a stand-alone institution licensed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange with Jeddah based IsDB Group being the principal shareholder having a 29.97% shareholding of the Bank.

The solution is integrated with various other peripheral systems to help improve operational efficiency and support future business requirements to offer superior service for its customers across Sri Lanka.
In a pandemic-stricken business environment, the global investment banking industry is witnessing many changes due to more demands by clients, digital transformation, regulatory compliance, internationalisation, and growing competition. This is leading to an increase in overall costs of operations and affecting the bottom line. Investment bankers today need to have increased focus on innovation, efficiency, productivity, and client centricity. Hence, in line with the ‘new normal’, investment banking solutions must integrate various investment banking platforms such as wealth management and custody divisions that completely automate business needs of investment bankers.
In such a backdrop, Epic Lanka and Credence Analytics have offered Bank of Ceylon a comprehensive solution of the highest standards incorporating global best practices to meet the growing demands of its customers. The ‘iDEAL Wealth & Funds 6.0’ solution, an award-winning

Commenting about their latest solution, Bank of Ceylon Deputy General Manager (International, Treasury and Investment) R.M.N.

“After evaluating several options, we decided to partner with Epic Lanka and Credence Analytics to implement ‘iDEAL Wealth & Funds 6.0’. We believe the state-of-the-art technology solution is capable of managing the activities across various functions and transaction value chain to enable Bank of Ceylon to meet the needs of its growing customer base across various segments, maximise return on investments, be ready for frequent regulatory changes and to improve operational efficiency.”

We are now facing one of the greatest challenges of our time in an increasingly globalised world that needs to address the challenges of the ‘new normal’. With businesses being forced to adjust to this new change, financial institutions need to adopt disruptive technologies to address numerous challenges posed by the pandemic while gearing themselves to meet customers’ demands.

1H Profit After Tax soars by 50% to post Rs. 1.35 b


Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC yesterday reported an impressive performance for the six-month period which ended 30 June to report a Pre-Tax Profit of Rs. 1,822 million and a Post-Tax Profit of Rs. 1,356 million with growth rates of 27% and 50% respectively, while demonstrating the resilience amidst challenging macro-economic conditions. 
The bank’s performance was characterised by strength and resilience despite the heightened uncertainty due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In a statement, the bank said against the backdrop of the COVID-19 impact on the Sri Lankan economy, the bank’s Operating Profits before VAT on Financial Services reached Rs. 2,245 million with an increase of 25%, reflecting the excellence in core banking performance and the success of cost containment measures evidenced by improvement in all key matrices, which now rank among the industry bests. This feat was achieved even after setting aside a sizable provision buffers for the probable deterioration in credit quality due to COVID-19 pandemic.
The bank increased impairment provision buffers in 1H prudently taking into consideration of increased risks and uncertainties due to COVID 19 pandemic through experience adjustments, management overlays and downgrading of credit exposures of the borrowers in elevated risk industries. As a result, total impairment expense for 1H and 2Q increased by 29% and 58% respectively. Further, the bank opted not to use the relief allowed by the industry prudential regulator in making impairment provisions for investments in foreign currency-denominated Government securities while being prudent. 
The bank’s Net Interest Income for the period witnessed an increase of 17% due to significant reduction in financial cost of funds at a rate faster than the drop-in interest yields of interest earning assets. Consequently, the bank’s Net Interest Margin for the period improved to 4.84% from 4.41% reported six months ago. In the meantime, the bank’s Net Fee and Commission Income recorded a growth of 45% with the rebound in demand for credit due to revival of economic activity in 1H amidst the low interest rate regime despite the adverse impact of lockdowns had during 2Q and waiver of fees and charges mandated by the industry regulator. Meanwhile, the volatility in foreign exchange rates enabled the bank to increase its Foreign Exchange Income substantially as reflected in Other Operating Income. On the other hand, the aforementioned currency volatility had a negative impact on the bank’s net trading income due to mark-to-market losses on forward exchange contracts and currency swaps.
The bank is committed to revenue maximisation and cost management despite sector vulnerabilities that prevailed since last year. The bank’s Cost-to-Income Ratio improved from 45.66% to 42.95% within the six months period owing to the excellence in core banking performance which is reflected in the noteworthy overall growth in key revenue lines and various strategies and measures taken to contain overhead costs. The cost management culture embedded across the bank assisted curtailing Operating Expenses by 7% in 2021 1H compared to 2020 1H. Meanwhile, increased allocations for performance bonuses, spending on development of human capital and staff welfare led to an increase in personnel costs during the reporting period compared to previous period.
The Bank’s Post-Tax Profits for 1H also gained to an extent due to application of lower Corporate Income Tax Rate of 24% for tax provisioning in accordance with the guideline issued by CA – Sri Lanka on 23 April.
The bank continues to report solid Key Profitability Indicators which rank among the highest in the industry. The bank’s Pre-Tax Return on Assets also improved to 2.02% from 1.70%. Further, the bank reported a stunning Return on Equity (ROE) of 16.95% during the period under review which stands among the industry best.
The bank’s Earnings per Share (EPS) for the six months period rose to Rs. 3.06 in 2021 1H from Rs. 2.05 in 2020 1H driven by the excellent overall performance. Meanwhile, the Bank’s Net Asset Value per Share increased by 9% during the six-month period to reach Rs. 37.97 as of 30 June 2021.
The bank’s Total Asset Base stood at Rs.187.41 billion as of 30 June 2021 after reporting a growth of 6% during the period, supported by the expansion in the credit book and investments other financial instruments. The Bank’s Gross Loans and Advances Book recorded a growth of 6% to reach Rs. 138 billion. Meanwhile, Customer Deposits recorded a growth of over 4% to reach Rs. 147 billion as of 30 June 2021. The bank also attracted more low-cost current and savings deposits, as out of the Rs. 5.8 billion total deposits it raised during the first six months, over 73% were low cost. 
The Bank’s CASA Ratio improved to 27% from 25% within a time span of six months, which is one of the reasons for the reduction in financial cost of funds during the period under review.  
The Bank’s Regulatory Gross Non-Performing Loan Ratio improved from 6.73% to 6.61% during 1H amidst tough macroeconomic conditions whilst the bank’s Net Non-Performing Loan Ratio improved from 2.34% to 1.94% during 1H 2021 due to prudent provisioning.
Commenting on the financial performance, the bank’s Managing MD/CEO Nimal Tillekeratne said: “We are extremely proud and pleased to deliver such an excellent performance under the extreme conditions created by the pandemic. This performance has been hard-won on account of a proactive approach to business while leveraging on emerging opportunities in the market in a prudent manner. 
“Despite the moratoriums and provisioning that had to be provided for, the bank has successfully recorded profitability while consolidating customer and investor confidence, surpassing budgets for the first half of 2021 financial year.”
The bank maintains all its Capital and Liquidity Ratios well above the regulatory minimum standards. The bank’s Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Capital Ratio as of 30 June 2021 stood at 12.59% and 15.01% respectively. The bank’s Statutory Liquid Asset Ratios (SLAR) as of 30 June stood at 31% and 50.37% for Domestic Banking Unit and Off-Shore Banking Unit respectively. Meanwhile, the Bank’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under BASEL III stood well above the statutory minimums. The bank maintained LCR Ratios of 268.04% and 229.81% for all currencies and LKR respectively.
Adding further, Pan Asia Chairman Jayantha S.B. Rangamuwa said: “For a banking institution to record profitability amidst a global pandemic and unfavourable macroeconomic conditions, points to the outstanding systems and governance with the institution. 
“By demonstrating this industry-leading performance, Pan Asia Bank has shown that it is the truly Sri Lankan Bank that is focused on building stakeholder wealth while supporting people impacted by COVID-19 – helping to support and uplift their livelihoods. The numerous reputed awards and accolades won during the year are further testimony to Pan Asia Bank’s potential and its path to even higher profitability by the end of 2021 financial year.”
In addition to its impressive financial performance, Pan Asia Bank has been recognized in the recent past by many local and global reputed institutions for excellence in the Banking sphere. Pan Asia Bank was crowned as the ‘Fastest Growing Commercial Bank in Sri Lanka – 2021’ by the International Business Magazine Awards. Moreover, the bank was also recently bestowed with the prestigious ‘Best Bank for Treasury Activities Sri Lanka - 2021’ award by the Global Banking and Finance Review; ‘The Best Treasury and Cash Management Bank Sri Lanka 2021’ by the International Business Magazine Awards; and ‘The Best Bank in Treasury Management Sri Lanka 2021’ by World Business Outlook Awards 2021, which demonstrates the bank’s prudent and best-in-Class Treasury and Cash Management Operation.
Acknowledged as one of the fastest-growing banks in Sri Lanka, Pan Asia Bank has earned a solid reputation as an agile and robust banking institution that is based on a strong framework of good governance, sustainability and ethical operations.

On the backdrop of completing 129 years of operation in the country, HSBC Sri Lanka continued its leadership position as the Best International Retail Bank of the Year, at the Asian Banking and Finance Retail Banking Awards 2021 for the fifth time, since 2016.
This year over 140 exceptional banks from 31 countries were recognised for their continuous drive to grow and provide services to customers amidst several uncertainties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Winning banks were judged for their resilience and ability to adapt and leverage digital technology amidst the crisis, and cater to the ever-changing customer preferences and increased comfort with digital products and services, to benchmark themselves against market competition. 
HSBC Country Head of Wealth and Personal Banking Nadeesha Senaratne said: “We are truly humbled to be recognised as Sri Lanka’s best International Retail Bank of the year given the challenging environment faced by many businesses and the impacts of the pandemic on local communities. This award is a testament to the dedication and commitment of our Wealth and Personal Banking team in Sri Lanka and the customer confidence in HSBC. It further proves that our strategy to invest in technology and help customers adapt to the new normal with digital banking products and services, and making banking fast, easy to use and secure, is paying off.”
He further said: “I take this opportunity to thank all our customers for the trust placed in us, and to our staff for their continued commitment to supporting our customers and the wider community that we serve.” 
This year HSBC rolled out several digital banking channels for customers to be able to bank from anywhere, anytime. Customers, who had been slow to adopt digital in the past, were forced to embrace technology during the pandemic. More than 80% of the bank’s clients now use digital channels including mobile banking, e-wallets, real-time cash deposit machines and other digital services. 
The same applies to corporate banking where HSBC has a 90% digital penetration rate and 70% mobile penetration for the client group. HSBC was able to bring clients on board remotely using technology and was the first to introduce LiveSign in Sri Lanka, and provide access to credit cards, loans and customer service.
Earlier this year, HSBC Sri Lanka was also named International Bank of the Year by Asiamoney in the Best Bank Awards 2021 for the fifth consecutive year and was awarded the same title by Finance Asia in its Country Awards 2021, for the sixth time. 
These awards further reinforce HSBC Sri Lanka’s longstanding commitment to the country and customers, as well as recognises the bank’s overall dominance in wholesale banking, wealth and personal banking, and global banking and markets.

With SDB bank set to host their Secondary Public Offering (SPO) on 5 August, investor forums both locally and globally continue to discuss the differentiated investment potential the bank’s strategic SME growth focus carries. 
A cornerstone of their historic growth journey, it will afford customers, shareholders, other stakeholders and the general public a unique opportunity to share in growth across the nationally critical SME segment. 
SDB bank’s upcoming SPO represents the second phase of its capital raising plan which commenced last year. The first phase involved their phenomenally successful rights issue in FY 2020, which gained recognition as the first-ever digital rights issue by a Colombo Stock Exchange-listed entity plus the first local digital share subscription to be oversubscribed. Distinct from an IPO, SPO is a capital-raising effort by a firm that is already listed on their respective stock exchange, and it involves the sale of new shares to the public through a secondary offering.
The bank will offer 68 million new ordinary voting shares to the public as part of the SPO at a share price of Rs. 51.50, with provision for an additional 20 million shares in the event of an oversubscription. Considered industry-wide to be the rural growth engine of Sri Lanka, SDB bank’s latest capital raising effort will entail manifold benefits for the bank, its shareholders and diverse customer base, while positively impacting the national economy.
Firstly, it will allow SDB bank to continue its strategic growth plan for the next three-four years uninterrupted, further extending the growth phase it has enjoyed on the back of its focus on SMEs, female entrepreneurship, emphasis on digitalisation and taking of digital banking services to the masses including the island’s rural most parts.
Equally, the raising of capital affords the bank added financial strength in continuing its historic and strategic support of SMEs, who form the backbone of the Sri Lankan economy and account for 52% of national GDP. The SPO-raised funds will support the bank’s expected loan portfolio growth across this segment and others for the period 2021-2022, ensuring entrepreneurship is nurtured, allowing for greater participation and contribution to the economy.
Also, the capital raising exercise will ensure SDB bank can maintain a stronger capital base, by strengthening its equity base and thereby, its capital adequacy ratios in line with the BASEL III guidelines of the Central Bank. This will allow SDB bank greater resiliency in comfortably absorbing external economic shocks arising from unexpected events.
NDB Investment Bank will perform the role of Financial Advisor and Manager to the SPO that is to be conducted on the CSE. The two parties share a long history of cooperation involving investments, with NDBIB previously advising SDB bank on their initial listing on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 2012, the successful Rights Issue in 2020, as well as numerous other fund-raising transactions for close to a decade. 
SDB bank CEO Thilak Piyadigama stated: “We’re extremely proud and energised by the extent of the progress we’ve made over the years together, with our focus on sustainable growth in key national segments, and I confidently invite existing and new shareholders to join hands with SDB bank as we continue to fuel growth countrywide.”

It is an inherent drive that has enabled us to scale heights even in the most challenging times.” 
He explains that in this last year, CDB worked on two primary beliefs: optimising its technological expertise to ensure seamless delivery of products and services and keeping both the CDB team and customers safe during pandemic times. “Having always recognised that technology will be a fundamental driver of the future, our technology platforms were ready to step up.  By combining our people-to-people engagement with our flair for innovation, our team was prepared for the seamless delivery of our products and services and thus becoming a brand at top of mind recall.”  
CDB has displayed repeatedly that its service benchmarks are well beyond expectation as is its expansive product portfolio which is the archetype of inherent readiness for a constantly evolving environment of needs and aspirations. As Karthik mentions, “This has been appealing to our customers and I’m truly appreciative of the confidence and loyalty our customers have displayed through the years. Our brand has etched itself into foremost status in top of mind recall which pushes us to move upwards and outwards every time. Thank you to our CDB customers for being a true partner on our mutual journey of success.”

Chairman Kanchana Ratwatte


 





General Manager D.P.K. Gunasekera




Bank of Ceylon, the ‘Bankers to the Nation’, completes 82 years of leading the Sri Lankan banking and finance landscape. Taking pride in its unparalleled performance over these years, the bank has been able to provide forward-
thinking, resilient, and advanced financial services to the nation while extending its penetration into overseas markets. 
It was legislated under ‘The Bank of Ceylon Ordinance’ in 1938 and declared open by the Governor Sir Andrew Caldecott at No. 41, Bristol Street, which street is known today as Sir Baron Jayathilaka Mawatha, on 1 August 1939.
Reminiscing the glorious success of the bank over the years, the bank’s Chairman Kanchana Ratwatte said, “Fully conscious of the need to fulfil all aspects of its duties and obligations as a responsible corporate citizen, the Bank of Ceylon has always rendered its fullest cooperation to the socio-economic development of the country for over the past 82 years. Winning the hearts and minds of the people and becoming one of their close-knit family members is not attained by merely catering to the financial needs of the people. 
“Guided by a precise vision and mission, BOC has been able to get itself deeply rooted in the minds and souls of the Sri Lankan community and accepted without any reservations. The long history of the bank repeatedly brings out evidence in each decade as to how it became the preferred choice of the people. We cherish the love and patronage shown towards us by fellow Sri Lankans, which made us stand strong over these years. BOC’s deep-rooted relationship with the stakeholders has been earned through its commitment to serving the public, and the valour it has displayed in difficult times in assisting the people. This is our strength and it will continue to make us stronger year by year.” 
General Manager D.P.K. Gunasekera recalled the unblemished presence the bank has in the banking chronicles of the country. He noted, “Reaching 82 years with an unblemished record itself proves the story behind the bank’s success. Braving environmental and other unforeseen obstacles and sailing undaunted across the troubled waters maintaining its balance it has been a voyage of success over the years. On this occasion, we recall with gratitude the initiative of the pioneers of the bank who realised the need to set up what would become the first Sri Lankan bank to serve the people of this country. 
“They also had the vision to build it up as the best performing bank of the country and the trendsetter to the other banks. I am sure Bank of Ceylon will continue to play its leading role in contributing to the economic development process the Government has embarked upon, as the leading state sector bank in the future as well.” 
For the past 82 years, the Bank of Ceylon has established itself as a powerhouse that brightened the Nation’s hopes and aspirations by providing customer centric banking solutions. BOC has reached over 2000 customer touch points across Sri Lanka and has established its branches in Chennai, Male, Hulhumale and Seychelles. Further, BOC maintains a full-fledged banking subsidiary in London.
The bank was able to stand tall as the nation’s premier bank providing financial solutions for all requirements of the people. During these years the bank was recognised in many local as well as international forums. The supremacy bank wields as the only state institution amongst the most admired entities in Sri Lanka is almost unmatched. The bank’s achievements demonstrate the heights it has reached within the banking industry of the region. 
‘The Banker’, a prestigious international bankers’ magazine published in UK once again rated BOC a being among their top 1000 global banks and the highest-ranking Sri Lankan bank in 2020. Inculcating sustainability into their corporate strategy is much acclaimed feat within the industry. 
The bank enjoys a humble satisfaction with regard to its achievements over the long years of its service to the nation. Brand Finance Lanka together with Media Services Publications rated BOC as the number one banking brand of the country. The bank’s brand value was Rs. 53 billion a 12% growth from the previous year. The bank has held this position for the past 13 years.
Reaching highest industry profits for the year 2020 of Rs. 23.6 billion profit before tax and Rs. 3 trillion assets are some of its unparalleled feats. The bank’s Inward Remittance grew over $ 2.8 billion in year 2020 which is yet another noteworthy achievement. 
Establishing the ‘Business Rehabilitation and Revival unit’ the task of which is to uplift and rehabilitate corporate sector businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitating importation of vaccine in support of the ongoing inoculation program are other ‘firsts’ by the bank. Creating significant economic value in the small and medium enterprises sector and thereby contributing to national economic development considerably, BOC’s ‘Divi Udana Loan Scheme’ was extended as an opportunity for Micro/SMEs to conveniently access specialised development loans from BOC, in furthering their entrepreneurial ambitions while boosting national economic growth. 
This facility was further enriched under the ‘Saubagya’ Working Capital Loan scheme, which had offered facilities, worth over Rs. 39 billion, while total moratorium facilities offered were valued at over Rs. 800 billion.
As the financial powerhouse of the country BOC places its trust in its customer centric business philosophy which has brought it all its glory and success over the years. The bank looks forward with much courage and determination to improve on its performance in years to come as well.

Primary auction goes undersubscribed 
Money market liquidity fluctuates


By Wealth Trust Securities

The overall activity in the secondary bond market continued to be dull during the week ending 30 July, as yields were seen fluctuating within a narrow range on the back of thin volumes. The limited activity centred on the 15.12.22, 01.10.23 and 15.11.23 maturities as its yields were seen moving within the range of 5.72% to 5.80%, 6.27% to 6.30% and 6.35% to 6.38%, respectively. 
The persistent reduction in demand at the weekly Treasury bill auction which saw its total accepted volume dip further to a low of 58.30% of its total offered amount coupled with a drop in the total accepted amount at the T-bond auctions to 68.90% against a total offered amount of Rs. 120 billion were seen as the reasons that led to the dull momentum. Furthermore, an issuance window of 20% each for the 01.12.24 and 15.03.31 maturities was unexpectedly opened following the announcement of the bond auction results, which was seen dampening sentiment further. 
In the meantime, Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) or inflation for the month of July increased for a third consecutive month to 5.7% on its point to point, when compared against its previous month’s figures of 5.2% while its annual average too increased further to 4.2% from 4.1%. 
The foreign holding in rupee bonds remained steady for a third consecutive week at Rs. 2.49 billion for the week ending 28 July, while the daily secondary market Treasury bond/bill transacted volumes for the first four trading days of the week averaged Rs. 12.90 billion. 
In money markets, the total outstanding surplus liquidity increased to Rs. 8.72 billion against its previous weeks of Rs. 0.03 billion while CBSL’s holding of government securities increased to Rs. 1,141.05 billion against its previous weeks of Rs. 922.09 billion. In addition, the overnight net surplus liquidity fluctuated during the week, within a high of Rs. 23.89 billion to a week closing low of Rs. 8.72 billion. The weighted average rates on overnight call money and repo increased further to average 5.11% and 5.14%, respectively, for the week. 
USD/LKR
The Forex market continued to remain inactive during the week. The daily USD/LKR average traded volume for the first four trading days of the week stood at $ 37.86 million.

Union Bank said last week it continued to maintain consistent performance even during the second quarter and concluded the first half of the year 2021 with a strong core banking performance. 






Chairman Atul Malik


 





CEO Indrajit Wickramasinghe





It said although the banking sector activities were under pressure in the second quarter amidst travel restrictions, etc. that delimited operations, the focused efforts of Union Bank’s operations contributed to this performance in the second quarter. 
Revenues were impacted by the low AWPLR that prevailed along with the new credit relief schemes introduced by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) for customers affected by the third wave of the pandemic. The relief scheme which came into effect in May 2021 was rolled out by the Bank immediately; offering extensions of capital and/or interest payments to affected customers up to 31 August 2021. The concessions assented relief for customers within the Retail, SME and corporate segments affected by the third wave of the pandemic and included late payment fee waivers, due date extensions and payment flexibilities for credit cardholders as well.
However, the Bank’s Net Interest Income (NII) during the first half of 2021 was Rs. 2,103 million and reported a growth of 4% YoY. The Net Interest Margin improved to 3.44% during the period ended 30 June 2021, compared to 3.23% in the comparative period.
Late payment and other fees were waived for impacted customers until August 2021 in-line with the CBSL guidelines. The decline in economic activity and import restrictions further impacted fee income. However, the Net Fee and Commission Income of the Bank grew during the first half by 42% YoY. The significant growth in fee income also reflects the impact of the COVID-19 relief schemes granted in 2020, which affected the revenues in the comparative period last year. 
Total other income of the Bank declined during the 1st half by 18% YoY to Rs. 527 million. This was mainly due to total capital gains including investments in unit income declining by 43% to Rs. 310 million. However, exchange gains increased by 117% YoY, largely driven by the exchange rate deflation by 8% and the rate fluctuations during the said period.
Despite external challenges, the Operating Income of the Bank for the period ended 30 June 2021 was Rs. 3,036 million and reported a growth of 3% over the comparable period last year. Due to continued focus and efforts on prudent cost management across the bank, the Operating Expenses reduced by 6% YoY to Rs. 1,809 million. Pre-impairment profits of the Bank for 1H2021 were Rs.1,227 Mn and reflected a 18% growth YoY. 
While the Bank’s actual credit losses were low, the Bank booked significant provisions during this period to account for the weakened environment, resulting in a 55% increase in impairment charges over the comparative period. 
Overcoming the challenges in the external environment, the Bank recorded healthy results from operating activities before all taxes and the share of subsidiary profits amounting to Rs. 791 million, which was an increase of 5% over the comparative period. The Profit after Tax of the Bank for the period under review grew by 44% to Rs. 455 million highlighting its steady progress during the first half of 2021. 
The gross NPL ratio of the Bank reduced to 5.83% by end of the reporting period compared to 6.05% as of December 2020. 
Total assets of the Bank stood at Rs. 121,244 million as of 30 June. The Bank’s loans and receivables stood at Rs. 70,656 million reflecting a 5% YTD growth, while the deposits base was Rs. 85,132 million with a YTD growth of 3%. From January to June 2021, average CASA grew by 11% over the comparative period. Efforts of maintaining a healthy CASA inflow was supported by focused acquisition strategies driven by retail, corporate and SME banking segments despite the challenges in movement and restrictions in effect. The CASA ratio of the Bank was 28.5% by end of the reporting period.
The Bank continued to maintain its robust Capital Adequacy, reporting a Total Capital Ratio of 15.88% as at the reporting date. 
Commenting on the first half performance of the Bank, Director/Chief Executive Officer Indrajit Wickramasinghe said, “The Bank’s growth momentum in the second quarter of 2021 was impacted by the sudden outbreak of the third wave and its resultant impacts on the operating environment. With the development of the third wave, our key priority had to be adjusted once more towards extending the CBSL recommended credit relief to impacted customers in a bid to support them to cope with the continued financial pressures. 
“During this challenging period while managing its bottom line, the Bank remained mindful in maintaining its healthy liquidity position, strong capital adequacy and ensuring the safety of customers and staff as a part of its sustainable business strategy. In the remainder of the year, while providing the much-needed financial impetus to our customers across Retail, Corporate and SME segments we will continue the focussed growth initiatives to drive performance while taking all due precautions to maintain optimum safety levels for our staff and customers.”

Sampath Bank PLC announced the launch of a helpline for business start-up advisory services under its flagship entrepreneurship development program, ‘Sampath Saviya,’ recently. This new endeavour builds on the Bank’s longstanding efforts to support the nation’s entrepreneurs and nurture a culture of entrepreneurship around the island.
Focusing on the critical incubation period during which early-stage businesses tend to face heightened levels of challenges, the initiative seeks to facilitate the business incubation process. Playing an advisory role, Sampath Bank will be offering much-needed guidance and support to help start-ups establish their businesses and commence operations. 
Sampath Bank is geared to offer guidance on early-stage business planning and registration. Further they provide information to connect with the institutions which assist business start-ups, build relationships with the Bank and the learning programs on business development.
“Right from our inception, we at Sampath Bank have always believed in the entrepreneurial spirit of our fellow Sri Lankans and sought to support them through every stage of their growth story. Going beyond offering innovative financial solutions and services, we continue to seek more ways in which we can deliver greater value to them.

Since then, it has grown into a key pillar of the Bank’s community outreach efforts to emerge as its flagship entrepreneurship development program. The program has brought a significant positive transformation in the communities throughout the period. 
The Bank hosts a series of complimentary ‘Sampath Saviya’ MSME development workshops around the island wherein senior representatives from within Sampath Bank and subject matter experts from outside offer advice and guidance on a wide range of topics. With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank shifted the entire program online, engaging MSMEs as well as university students through a series of webinars.

Ceylinco Life has placed another green pin on its branch map with the opening of its latest eco-friendly branch in Piliyandala in a purpose-designed building constructed to the environment-friendly specifications adopted for all new branches on company-owned land.
Intended to reduce the company’s carbon footprint while improving the customer and employee experience, the latest branch is located at No. 192, Horana Road, Piliyandala, on three floors that provide 5,683 square feet of space. 
An investment of Rs. 54 million, the Piliyandala branch completed in 11 months is designed for optimal use of natural light, is powered entirely by a 20kW solar power system that results in zero consumption of electricity from the national grid, and has its own waste-water recycling system. It is also equipped with the latest energy-efficient artificial lighting and air conditioning systems, has a rainwater harvesting facility and uses minimum amounts of pipe-borne water.
While the construction was designed to require minimum quantities of timber, trees planted in the premises upon completion of the building, further contribute to the company’s green agenda. 
The building will function as an office for the Ceylinco Life branches in the Piliyandala area. With ample dedicated parking bays for visitors, it is designed to enhance customer convenience. In the same vein, the branch features private discussion rooms to ensure customer privacy within the premises and to deliver specialised customer handling processes by a team of well-trained and experienced employees, the company said. 
A cash deposit machine is deployed at the branch to enable deposits of policy premiums even during non-office hours and on holidays.
Ceylinco Life has been protecting the lives of the residents of Piliyandala and its suburbs via a dedicated branch since 1992. The newest branch is the seventh in the Colombo district to operate in a Ceylinco Life owned building and is the 43rd building owned by the company.

Bancstac Director Evan Lau (left) and Sampath Bank Head of Card Centre Darshin Pathinayake 
 

Sampath Bank PLC has extended its strategic partnership with Paycorp International Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bancstac (Paycorp International).
Initiative is to provide Sampath Bank customers with the capability to accept online payments from American Express, Diners Club and Discover Network Cardmembers through Paycorp International’s Internet Payment Gateway (IPG). 
Sampath Bank customers can already accept Visa, Mastercard and UnionPay International online payments through the Sampath Payment Gateway. With this partnership, Sampath Bank becomes the first local bank in Sri Lanka to enable its customers to access online payment transactions across these six major issuer networks.
To start accepting online payments for American Express, Diners Club and Discover Network, Sampath Bank customers simply need to apply online for a merchant account with Paycorp International. All applications are independently approved by Paycorp International, and the feature is then automatically enabled for approved merchants. Thereafter, merchants can conveniently access all their online payment transactions across six major issuer networks from the Paycorp International IPG merchant portal. 
Paycorp International’s pioneering IPG is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Level 1 certified and offers 3D secure certified payment verification (3DS) for added security and protection to businesses and consumers against fraud across all major credit card schemes. Traditionally, businesses in Sri Lanka had to integrate various payment gateways and technologies to process online payments for different groups of issuer networks. The strategic partnership between Sampath Bank and Paycorp International will significantly simplify online payment transactions for businesses and government agencies across the island, thereby giving a substantial boost to digital commerce in the country. 
This strategic partnership supports Sampath Bank’s continued efforts to accelerate the pace of acceptance, adoption and integration of innovative digital payment solutions in line with the Government and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s efforts to implement new technologies to strengthen the payments and settlements infrastructure.
Sampath Bank Head of Card Centre Darshin Pathinayake said: “At Sampath Bank, we have always strived to leverage emerging technologies to deliver innovative solutions that transform Sri Lanka’s financial services landscape and add more value to the nation. Empowering businesses with the necessary finances and the right solutions through every stage of their growth journey remains one of our key areas of focus. We have continued to enable businesses to take their first steps into the world of digital commerce. We are excited to expand our partnership with Paycorp International to enhance our customers’ payment acceptance capabilities. 
“Sampath Bank business and government customers can now seamlessly accept payments from six of the world’s major issuers, which will help drive sales and business growth. This is yet another innovative solution to have been developed through our longstanding partnership with Paycorp International. We invite businesses of all sizes to simplify the payments processes on their e-commerce portals.” 
Bancstac Director Evan Lau said: “We are excited to strengthen our partnership with Sampath Bank and deliver our online payment acceptance capability for American Express, Diners Club and Discover Network to Sampath Bank’s customers. We are committed to a vision of modernising Sri Lanka’s digital payment economy by delivering frictionless payment experiences to businesses, government and the community.”

Awarded by the Great Place to Work, the internationally acclaimed list follows a strict criterion in acknowledging the best of the best in terms of workplaces in the Asia region. 
The international recognition follows hot on the heels of AIA being recognised as a Best Workplace by Great Place to Work in Sri Lanka for the ninth consecutive year. AIA was inducted into the Great Place to Work Hall of Fame in 2017, in its fifth straight year of winning the award and has thereby been established as a leading employer in Sri Lanka. Apart from the main recognition of being a Best Workplace, AIA Sri Lanka has received many category awards from Great Place to Work institute over the years and has also been recognised as a Best Workplace for Women for three consecutive years.

PAYable Ltd., Sri Lanka's leading fintech and digital payment solutions provider, announced the launch of the PAYable SoftPOS, developed in partnership with Mastercard and Worldline. The SoftPOS solution is built on cutting-edge, secure digital payment technology that will enable any smart phone or device to be used as a payment acceptance device. 
As a low-cost acceptance solution, SoftPOS will enable many micro and small businesses to come into the realm of the digital payments ecosystem and benefit from it. The solution will also help businesses that work seasonally or accept payments periodically to begin accepting digital payments without investing heavily in a dedicated acceptance device. 
Businesses with large rider fleets are expected to benefit immensely from this solution as it will eliminate the need for riders to carry multiple devices thereby saving costs considerably. Riders can simply install the app on their mobile phones and accept payments that are deposited directly into the companies account – eliminating the need for riders to handle cash. 
Speaking on the solution and its implications in a post-COVID economy, PAYable CEO/Co-founder Yohan Wijesiriwardane said, “The SoftPOS system is a gamechanger for the Sri Lankan cashless eco-system. The solution will allow businesses that are just starting up, businesses that are recovering from COVID, seasonal businesses and even businesses with large rider fleets to streamline payments and offer contactless solutions that are the way forward in this climate. We would like to thank Mastercard and Worldline for making this possible for PAYable, as well as for the local cashless infrastructure.”
Worldline South Asia & Middle East Managing Director Deepak Chandnani said, “We thank MasterCard for making us their trusted partner in their Soft POS journey to enable millions of small merchants to accept digital payments across various regions. We are happy to work with PAYable on launching their SoftPOS solution in Sri Lanka offering a secure, seamless, and contactless shopping experience to their merchants and consumers.”
Speaking on the solution and its benefits, Mastercard Country Manager – Sri Lanka and Maldives Rajesh Mani said, “We are very happy to partner with PAYable to bring the SoftPOS solution to Sri Lanka. Over the last decade, digital payments in Sri Lanka have grown exponentially and we are pleased to help add yet another innovation in digital payment technology to the mix. The SoftPOS solution allows merchants to accept NFC payments by simply allowing the cardholder to tap their card on the screen of the device, making it one of the easiest to use and safe solutions available.”
The SoftPOS solution includes a tri-lingual interface, best-in-class payment security and can be integrated with other PAYable products and third-party applications. The solution is available to any Sri Lankan resident anywhere in the country and can be installed on any NFC enabled Android or iOS device.

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has once again been recognised as the ‘Strongest Bank Brand’ in the country in 2021 by Brand Finance, one of the world’s leading independent brand valuation consultancies.
Commercial Bank was also named the Strongest Banking Brand in the 2020 ranking, which makes this the second consecutive year the Bank has won this prestigious accolade that speaks to the strength of the brand of the largest private bank in the country, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2020. 
“The past year gave many businesses an opportunity to prove the substance behind their brands as they faced the challenges of the pandemic,” Commercial Bank Managing Director S. Renganathan said. 
“We are delighted that it has once again been proven that our strategic brand building efforts coupled with consistent performance have earned us this prestigious title. Our brand building process is meticulously thought through and involves management and staff at all levels and is focused on ethical and sustainable brand building. Accolades such as these are an encouragement to the ComBank team.”
The Commercial Bank brand secured the overall third pace in ranking of the strongest brands across all sectors in the country. 
Brand Finance computes the value of brands listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange using a method based on the Royalty Relief approach – a brand valuation method used by the company globally. Every year it puts 5,000 of the world’s biggest brands to the test and ranks brands across all sectors and countries and publishes nearly 100 reports.
The seven-step process of arriving at a brand value encompasses calculating brand strength using a balanced scorecard of metrics; assessing stakeholder equity and business performance; determining a royalty range for each industry reflecting the importance of brand to purchasing decisions; calculating the royalty rate; determining brand-specific revenues by estimating a proportion of parent company revenues attributable to a brand; determining forecast revenues; application of the royalty rate to the forecast revenues to derive brand revenues; and discounting brand revenues post-tax to a net present value which equals the brand value. 
Considered one of the world’s leading independent brand evaluation and ratings firms, Brand Finance PLC is headquartered in London and has a network of offices around the world. The Brand Finance rankings for Sri Lanka are published annually by LMD.
One of the most active and vibrant brands in Sri Lanka, Commercial Bank’s brand building efforts maintain a healthy balance between corporate and product communications and ground level customer engagement events. In addition to traditional media, the Bank is highly active in social and digital media and customer engagement events, at national and regional level. The Bank’s strong customer base covers all segments of society, and encompasses all socio economic groups spread across Sri Lanka.
The bank stated that it places heavy emphasis on strategy when formulating marketing plans and brand building activities. Commercial Bank maintains a constant watch over its brand performance and measures it both qualitatively and quantitatively. Parameters such as brand equity and top of mind recall are periodically monitored through research and the key takeouts are considered when marketing campaigns are planned. This strategic approach has helped the brand to evolve through the years and become one of the strongest brands in the country.

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Sri Lanka-based Ideal Finance Ltd.’s National Long-Term Rating to ‘AA-(lka)’ from ‘BB-(lka)’ and removed the rating from Rating Watch Positive (RWP). 
The Outlook is Stable.
The upgrade follows the completion of the progressive acquisition of a 58.2% stake in Ideal by India’s Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. (MMFSL) in July 2021.

Key rating drivers
Ideal’s National Long-Term Rating reflects Fitch’s expectation of extraordinary support from the parent, MMFSL, based on its assessment of MMFSL’s ability to provide support, if needed. The rating also takes into consideration MMFSL’s majority stake in Ideal, and potential for closer alignment of branding.
Fitch assesses Ideal to be of limited importance to MMFSL due to the nascent role in the group that is yet to be tested and still limited integration. Furthermore, Fitch believes that reputational damage to MMFSL could be contained, considering the different jurisdictions of the entities. MMFSL’s investment has diluted the stake of former major shareholder Ideal Motors, but the stake remains sizeable.
MMFSL is a 52%-owned subsidiary of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (M&M) and is the largest financier for M&M’s vehicles. MMFSL’s investment in Ideal is also aimed at supporting the sales of M&M vehicles in the Sri Lankan market.
Ideal’s intrinsic financial strength is assessed to be significantly weaker than its support-driven rating.

Rating sensitivities
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:
An upgrade of Ideal’s National Long-Term Rating would most likely result from a higher propensity of support from MMFSL through increased integration, or the evolution of its role in the group, which could raise Ideal’s strategic importance to its parent.
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:
Ideal’s National Long-Term Rating could be downgraded if MMFSL’s ability to provide support were to weaken, as signalled through a weakening of MMFSL’s credit standing. Any perceived weakening in MMFSL’s propensity to support Ideal could also be negative for Ideal’s rating. This could arise from a reduced importance to MMFSL as reflected in a decrease in the shareholding, Ideal’s inability to fulfil its intended role, or a sustained weak performance and prospects undermining its ability to support the majority shareholder’s objectives.

The 32nd AGM of the Association of Professional Bankers – Sri Lanka (APB) was held recently at the Bougainvillea Ballroom of Galadari Hotel – Colombo 04 on a hybrid basis, where a sufficient number of APB members attended the meeting physically in compliance with prevailing health quarantine measures, while majority of members attended the meeting virtually. 
APB – Sri Lanka was formed in July 1988 by a group of dedicated senior bankers, and has been the most represented organisation of banking professionals in the island. The APB was formed with a mission to sustain the highest standards of professionalism and integrity among bakers, to advance public interest and to influence the achievement of the highest ethical standards and governance in banking industry. Additionally, APB functions as a forum that brings together leading personalities in business administration to have intellectual discussion in the contemporary banking and economic context. 
Since 1998, the APB continued to conduct annual conventions on themes of contemporary interest. In fact, the Annual Convention of the APB has become a much-awaited event amongst the bankers in Sri Lanka. Due to the pandemic, the annual convention for the year 2020 was not held. Instead, the ADB Research Symposium 2021 was held on 22 March at the Grand Ballroom – Hilton Colombo with the theme ‘Sri Lanka Economic Resurgence in 2021 through Strategic Vision’, which was a novel experience in the banking landscape in Sri Lanka. Five high quality research papers were presented at the Research Symposium.  
The 32nd AGM was held as scheduled as per the provisions of constitution of APB. At the AGM held on 25 March, APB members elected office bearers and council members for the year 2021/2022. Accordingly, K.B. Rajapakse was unanimously elected as 32nd President of this premier Association of Bankers in the country. 
Rajapakse counts nearly 34 years of experience in banking industry. Having started his career at People’s Bank in June 1987, just after graduation from the University of Sri Jayawardenapura, Rajapakse is currently holding the Senior Deputy General Manager position of People’s Bank.

NDB Investment Bank’s (NDBIB) dominance as the market leader for investment banking in the country was affirmed by the highly acclaimed Euromoney magazine in its recently announced Country and Regional Awards for Excellence 2021. This marks the 10th consecutive year that NDBIB has secured the award for ‘Sri Lanka’s Best Investment Bank’ and is one of the longest winning streaks in addition to being the first and only investment bank in the country to be recognised by the Euromoney Magazine.
Expressing his views, NDBIB Chief Executive Officer Darshan Perera stated, “Being crowned as the best for 10 consecutive years has been one of the proudest moments for everyone at NDBIB. We have been steadfast in our quest for innovation and it is great to witness this being recognised repeatedly by Euromoney. We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our esteemed clientele who have placed their trust in us and been with us through this journey.”
NDBIB recorded a laudable performance in the year 2020, advising on a mammoth Rs. 37.4 billion worth capital raising transactions via equity, debt and hybrid instruments while executing numerous strategic M&A transactions despite a global pandemic and multiple lockdowns in Sri Lanka. NDBIB also remained active across all business verticals maintaining its stature as the market leader and preferred investment bank for capital raising and M&A advisory.
NDBIB also experienced heightened activity on the M&A front having advised on four M&A transactions in food and beverage, travel and leisure sectors including the divestiture of Daintee Ltd., the market leading confectionery company, to Sunshine Holdings PLC where NDBIB was the exclusive financial advisor to the divesting shareholders. This was the also the first transaction to be executed in the immediate aftermath of the first country-wide lockdown due to COVID-19.
NDBIB COO Kaushini Laksumanage commented, “This award speaks volumes for the great lengths we go to ensure the highest quality of standards and service that we maintain in all our transactions. We take great pride in being recognised by Euromoney for the tenth consecutive year, mainly due to our deep and diverse expertise and quest for continuous innovation.” She also reiterated the significance of the achievement amidst volatile market conditions, particularly during a year with multiple disruptions to business continuity due to lockdowns in the country.
Furthermore, NDBIB’s advisory expertise was sought by SDB Bank to raise Rs. 1.5 billion which was executed as the first stage of a three-year capital augmentation plan. The transaction was launched and concluded solely via an online platform at the height of the pandemic, the first ever fully digitalised fund raising on the Colombo Stock Exchange. 
Head of Corporate Advisory Nilendra Weerasinghe stated, “The most significant aspect of winning a prestigious award for a decade is the underlying consistency. It is such consistency that enables success even in the midst of a globally challenging year. We also look at advanced regional markets and their market participants to improve our processes and ensure we continue to add value to our clients.”
NDBIB was responsible for securing a $ 15 million commitment from Norfund to invest in NDB Bank’s capital raise and a $ 35 million foreign fund raising for a state-owned bank, a record volume of equity and debt transactions which resulted in dollar flows into Sri Lanka at this pivotal phase of the country’s economy. 
In addition to NDBIB being named ‘Sri Lanka’s Best Investment Bank’ for the 10th consecutive year by Euromoney, it has also been able to secure the ‘Best Corporate and Investment Bank’ award by Asiamoney Awards for five consecutive years. 
NDBIB is the investment banking subsidiary of NDB Capital Holdings, the largest full-service investment banking group in the country holding a complementary business portfolio consisting of fee based and fund-based investment banking, wealth management, managing private equity and stock broking.

CFA Society Sri Lanka CEO Aruna Alwis




CFA Society Sri Lanka has been conferred the CFA Society Excellence Award for Impact and Innovation (APAC Region), which recognises high impact and highly innovative initiatives that have potential for development, with the local chapter winning the award for its innovative solutions to aid students during the pandemic period.
While the Candidate Council (CC) of the CFA Society Sri Lanka was established to assist local CFA program candidates in their exam preparation and to help grow and build a sense of community, amidst the COVID-19 outbreak and an ensuing nationwide lockdown, activities were disrupted, with no readily available contingency plan. As such, key challenges included the delivery of exam preparation activities, as well as increased financial challenges and anxiety faced by candidates.
In a bid to address these challenges, the CC swiftly restructured its activities by converting exam preparation sessions to webinars within a week of health restrictions being imposed, to provide uninterrupted support, which was deemed to be a top priority since the June 2020 examination was not expected to be deferred.
It also set up an easy payment scheme with a leading bank in Sri Lanka, which converted CFA Program enrolment and exam fees to a 0% interest instalment plan, considered a first among CFA societies along with responding to soaring candidate inquiries through multiple channels, including social media and WhatsApp.
Notably, the CC was able to organise the highest number of events in its history during the year and offered benefits and services beyond its usual offerings to assist local candidates to navigate through a difficult period. 
With the experience gained through conducting online events, the CC also led other committees to conduct key society virtual events, including the first-ever livestreamed local Research Challenge finals, confidently. The positive impact of such initiatives was made evident through a marked increase in the CC membership uptake, which reached an all-time high during the period with membership registrations increasing by 20% YoY by the end of FY20 and further increasing to 58% YoY for FY21 YTD.
CFA Institute Managing Director of Global Society Relations Randi Tolber, CFA commented that the judges felt these innovations “were outstanding and unique, and extremely helpful for your goal of developing future investment management professionals. CFA Society Sri Lanka plays an integral role in helping us fulfil our shared mission and we are proud you are part of our community.”
CFA Society Sri Lanka President Dinesh Warusavitharana further highlighted the significance of the award, stating that “this accolade recognises the commitment of our Charterholders, staff members and volunteers to give back to society by assisting CC members in a pressing time of need, and reaffirms our continued focus on creating an ever-stronger sense of community among Charterholders and candidates”.
CFA Society Sri Lanka CEO Aruna Alwis noted: “At the very outset, I wish to thank Director and Candidate Council Chair Travis Gomez, CFA, Coordinator Sandunika Perera and the team of the CFA Society Sri Lanka, for their tireless efforts in supporting and guiding future CFA Charterholders. This award recognises their dedication and commitment towards the professional development of our society and the country.”

In its next step to advance economic development and fulfil its pledge to contributing to a resilient Sri Lanka, DFCC Bank announces the ‘DFCC Krushibala’ credit scheme, introduced exclusively to assist SMEs and corporates engaged in the local agricultural and related sectors. 
The new ‘DFCC Krushibala’ credit scheme introduces loan facilities of up to Rs. 100 million, with payment periods of five to seven years based on the type of loan, at a concessionary fixed interest rate of 7% per annum. The core objective of the scheme is to enable and empower SMEs in the agriculture and related sectors and build a strong platform through which they may work towards overcoming and rebounding from the difficulties faced due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
Loans under this scheme can be obtained for cultivation (tea/rubber/coconut/floriculture/rotational crop cultivation/inter cropping), livestock, dairy, agriculture processing (rice milling, grain legume processing, fruit and vegetable processing, dehydration, etc.), warehousing and enhancing storage facilities, development of commercial agriculture and hi-tech agriculture (control environmental agriculture/export agriculture crops, organic farming/nursery/seed production, drip irrigation, tissue culture, etc.) and introducing/capacity enhancement of organic fertiliser manufacturing.
The bank has committed to support the organic fertiliser manufacturing through this scheme at a historic time when the country is transforming to organic farming. Therefore, the financial support to entrepreneurs and enterprises that are venturing out to meet the demand of organic fertiliser is crucial at this juncture. 
Commenting on the launch of the loan scheme, DFFC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva stated, “DFCC Bank is delighted to contribute towards the empowerment of Small and Medium Enterprises engaged in agriculture throughout the country with the launch of our new loan scheme. The ‘Krushibala’ scheme has the potential to significantly enhance economic development, by driving growth across key priority sectors in SME and corporate markets. Through this scheme, we also strive to drive economic and financial gender equity and inclusivity across the priority sectors. The ‘Krushibala’ scheme is the next step on DFCC Bank’s journey to secure economic resilience and sustainability and showcases the potential socio-economic benefits that will be brought about by the bank’s long-term approach and strategy.”

Rs. 120 billion bond auctions in focus
Demand at weekly auction reduces 
Liquidity decreases sharply to a 17-month low


By Wealth Trust Securities

The trading activity in the secondary bond market dried up during the holiday shortened trading week ending 22 July while yields increased on the back of moderate trades. 
The sharp drop in money market liquidity coupled with an observant approach by most market participants ahead of Rs. 120 billion in Treasury bond auctions scheduled for 29 July saw yields on the liquid maturities of 15.11.23 and 01.12.24 increase to weekly highs of 6.45% and 6.77% respectively against its previous weeks closing levels of 6.23/27 and 6.70/75. In addition, maturities of 15.05.23 and 15.09.24 traded at levels of 5.95% and 6.65% respectively as well during the week. 
The upward and lacklustre sentiment was further supported by the reduction in the total accepted volume at the weekly bill auction to a four-week low of 72.10% of its total offered amount and against its previous weeks 100%. 
The foreign holding in Rupee bonds remained steady for a second consecutive week at Rs. 2.49 billion for the week ending 20 July while the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) for the month of June remained steady at 6.1% and 5.4% respectively on its point to point and annualised average.
The daily secondary market Treasury bond/bill transacted volumes for the first two trading days of the week averaged Rs. 32.63 billion. 
In money markets, the sharp drop in the total outstanding liquidity surplus to a 17-month low of Rs. 0.03 billion by the end of the week from its previous weeks Rs. 61.77 billion led to weighted average rates on overnight call money and repos increasing to average 5.04% and 5.05% respectively for the week against its previous weeks 4.98% and 4.99%.

SLIC Chief Executive Officer Chandana L. Aluthgama, SLIC Chairman Jagath Wellawatta and SLIC Director Surekha Alles at the AGM held online 
 

Sri Lanka Insurance held its Annual General Meeting via Zoom online platform on 7 July. The Chairman and Board of Directors participated in the meeting from their respective locations adhering to the COVID-19 health and safety standards issued by health authorities.
During the Annual General Meeting, it was declared that the company has closed year 2020 on a positive note, recording phenomenal growth with exceptional service innovations.
Sri Lanka Insurance, the premier insurer to the nation, recorded stellar performance in 2020 to record profit before taxation of Rs. 7.9 billion for the year 2020, with a strong improvement in combined Gross Written Premium (GWP) of Rs. 39.4 billion denoting growth of 16.65%.
In the year of 2020 Sri Lanka Insurance reported 29.9 % growth in life insurance premium increasing to Rs. 19.8 from 14.8 billion whilst Sri Lanka Insurance General reported 6.27% premium growth increasing to Rs. 20.1 billion. General insurance contributed 51% towards the total GWP whilst life insurance contributed 49%.
In continuing with its tradition of leadership, Sri Lanka insurance in 2020 surpassed its own record to declare a sum of Rs. 8.6 billion as bonus to policyholders. The cumulative life insurance bonus paid out during the past 15 years tops a massive Rs. 73.2 billion, making the SLIC bonus pay-out unmatchable.
“Inclusive insurance or, as I like to call it, ‘Insurance for All,’ is something I have consistently reiterated, for it is without a doubt one of the best ways to safeguard the quality of life for every Sri Lankan. Insurance helps everyone, even those at the base of the economic pyramid. A majority of Sri Lankans are unaware that insurance acts as a safety net in times of crisis and can provide people and businesses with a lifeline to help them recover from unforeseen events to re-establish their livelihoods. What is more disconcerting is that the lack of awareness has given rise to the misconceptions that insurance is a product for a privileged few. The task of delivering ‘Insurance for All’ is no easy feat. However, with over 59 years of expertise in serving the Sri Lankan market, I am convinced SLIC is best equipped to lead the movement to make insurance accessible to all,” noted SLIC Chairman Jagath Wellawatta.
“Notwithstanding the challenging macroeconomic environment and large-scale disruptions due to the COVID-19 outbreak, SLIC delivered an excellent performance in 2020, even outperforming the industry on many fronts. With our perceptions and outlook coloured by the pandemic, we embarked on a new strategic planning exercise aimed at mapping out SLIC’s growth trajectory for the next three years. Eager to put our plan into action, we advanced the first phase of our agenda and undertook a broad based restructuring initiative to embed a greater degree of management oversight across the general business and the life business, which we felt would pave the way for SLIC to systematically improve the scalability of each business, based on specific opportunities in the market,” noted SLIC Chief Executive Officer Chandana L. Aluthgama.  
Established in 1962, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation is the largest State-owned insurance company in Sri Lanka, with a managed asset base of over Rs. 235 billion and a Life fund of Rs. 134 billion, the largest in the local insurance industry. Sri Lanka Insurance ranked as the ‘Most Loved Insurance Brand’ and the ‘Most Valuable General Insurance Brand’ in the country by Brand Finance for the fourth consecutive year. Further Sri Lanka Insurance was recognised as a ‘Great Place to Work’ in Sri Lanka by Great Place to Work. The company is on the mission of being a customer focused company which constantly innovates in providing insurance services to customers and is now serves customers through an extensive network of 158 branches.

The report of 15 July, finds that Sri Lanka’s banking and NBFI sector has shown resilience in dealing with the crisis. 
Alpen Capital listed a number of opportunities including growth in deposits as customers moved away from risky institutions towards quality-assured products. Strategic acquisition of finance companies and smaller banks, and accelerated digitalisation also paves the way for further growth. These provide opportunity for Sri Lankan banks to reduce operating costs, grow low-cost fund base and drive strategic investments going forward, the report found. 
However, the risk of rising non-performing loans alongside downgrades in Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit rating could also bring challenges to banks with high exposure to foreign currency denominated debt. Alpen Capital noted credit growth to the private sector was moderate in 2020 at 6.5%, despite the deposit base of banks showing strong growth. Profitability of banks was adversely impacted by lower interest margins and high impairment costs. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka responded with several measures to ease pressure on banks and the economy including monetary policy easing, debt moratoriums and easing of capital and liquidity measures. 
The Sri Lankan Banking and NBFI Sector: Outlook and Opportunities report by Alpen Capital was launched at a webinar on Thursday, 15 July. The session included a panel discussion featuring Central Bank of Sri Lanka Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee Chairperson Dr. Ranee Jayamaha, Sri Lanka Banks’ Association Chairman Lakshman Silva, and RAK Bank UAE CEO Peter England.
Addressing participants at the webinar, Dubai’s RAK Bank CEO Peter England said, “The easiest thing in the world is to downgrade stuff. It’s a stroke of a pen, and it is very unfortunate. I believe in character, reputation and experience. Nothing is more important than character, and the Sri Lankan banking industry has demonstrated great resilience. I’m still very positive, about the banking sector in Sri Lanka.”
He added RAK Bank has had ‘zero issues’ in their operations with Sri Lanka’s banking sector, and this was a great testament to the strength of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the institutions. 
Alpen Capital in its report presents a detailed overview of the Sri Lankan economy and its banking and NBFI sectors. The report aims to provide an overall understanding of the sectors to investors, investment funds and companies looking for lucrative and viable investment opportunities in Sri Lanka. 
The report finds the NBFI sector severely challenged since the Easter attacks of 2019, and key business lines such as leasing remain impacted due to macro measures adopted by Government in face of the pandemic. Despite ongoing challenges, most institutions were well-capitalised during the latest financial year, with consolidation remaining a key priority of the Government, Alpen Capital reports. It found opportunities in agriculture, fisheries and livestock sectors backed by consumer and state interest, whilst digitalisation has improved reach to customers. Industry consolidation could dampen performance in the medium-term, the report found, whilst lack of diversity in funding sources make them more vulnerable to a liquidity crunch. 
Joining the discussion, Dr. Ranee Jayamaha, assured that Sri Lanka will meet its debt commitments due this month, stating, “There is no questions about it whatsoever,” and the Government was already working on meeting the next commitment due in early 2022. 
“The pandemic was hard on us, but we have been a resilient economy. The economy is recovering and growing in comparison to last year the contraction of 2020. The changes and action taken by the Government and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has provided stability to businesses and customers to overcome the disruptions. The banks have adequate capital and are well over regulatory ratios. Given these actions we enabled banks to keep the foreign currency liquidity. Rising NPLs remains a concern given the situation, but it remains to be seen and evaluated. With all these indicators we expect the Sri Lankan economy to pick up gradually,” Dr. Jayamaha said. 
The report also quotes several chief executives and directors of banks and NBFIs in Sri Lanka, who also point to a possible rise in non-performing loans, plus, pricing of foreign currency funding. They noted increased investments and foreign exchange inflows will assist the country to improve its macro fundamentals, whilst growing vaccination against COVID-19 will boost domestic economic activity. 
In its analysis, Alpen Capital notes the Sri Lankan economy contracted sharply by 3.6% in 2020 due to pressures led by COVID-19. However, the country recorded the smallest trade deficit since 2010, following regulatory measures to control imports of non-essential goods. The country’s current account has recorded a smaller deficit, at 1.3% of GDP in 2020, led by a fall in tourism earnings by 73.5%. However, this was largely offset by an increase in remittance inflows by 5.8%, the first of its kind since 2017.
“Despite the complex set of challenges encountered by the Sri Lankan economy in 2020, the country continues to offer viable opportunities for global investors. The various measures taken by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka have been instrumental in mitigating the impact of the pandemic on the economy as well as the banking and NBFI sectors. We have been actively advising our clients amidst these challenging times and have successfully arranged over USD 300 Mn for banks and finance companies since the onset of the pandemic,” says Alpen Capital Senior Director Dilip Samanthilaka.
“Sri Lanka, like most other economies, has had to cope with a host of economic challenges due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic amongst the global financial markets. However, the banking and NBFI sectors remain one of the largest and most promising sectors for the country. In spite of the current foreign currency debt obligations, the government has managed to boost reserves by securing project financing through various multilateral and bilateral channels. We believe that efforts of the government to ease pressure and consolidations within the sector will bring greater stability to the sectors going forward,” says Alpen Capital Senior Director Sharmin Karanjia.
Debt repayment obligations remain one of the key challenges for the economy with a debt to GDP ratio of 101% at the end of 2020. This caused multiple credit rating agencies such as Fitch to downgrade the country’s long-term foreign currency ratings to CCC in 2020. Reserves have been boosted this year by securing project financing through various multilateral and bilateral channels, as well as swap facilities under the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) currency framework, and the People’s Bank of China and planned IMF SDR allocation. 
In June 2021, Fitch Ratings has reaffirmed Sri Lanka’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘CCC’ and believes these resources will enable Sri Lanka to meet its remaining debt maturities through the rest of this year.
Crises are not new to the SL banking sector over the past three decades, and there is a lot of learning from that, said Banks’ Association Chairman Lakshman Silva. The Central Bank has proactively taken measures to give redress to sectors affected, and banks have implemented facilities to support businesses, he said. 
“The sector has been resilient as usual, and forged ahead despite challenges like the downgrade by rating agencies. We would like investors to look at the broader picture and not just ratings. DFCC Bank too has attracted $ 150 million capital, and we are ready to use that funding to assist the Government’s development plan. Sri Lanka is looking at an inclusive development plan, and supporting SMEs is a huge part of this process,” he added.

IFC South Asia Regional Director Hector Gomez Ang




IFC has appointed Hector Gomez Ang as Regional Director for South Asia. Based in New Delhi, he will play a critical role in boosting IFC’s investments in the region, as it looks to recover from the severe impacts of COVID-19. 
In taking on the new role, Gomez Ang said the private sector had an essential role in South Asia’s recovery from COVID-19, easing the burden on constrained public finances and reducing rising levels of poverty, due to the pandemic. 
“The pandemic has left a scar on countries throughout the region, exacting a huge human toll of which we must remain mindful. We must also accept that we may have to live with the lingering impacts of COVID-19 for some time to come, and so it’s all the more imperative to continue to work together to support jobs and economic growth,” Gomez Ang said. 
“That also means we must do what’s needed to ensure private sector investments can flow to where it’s needed, and in industries we know can support economic activity.”  
IFC’s focus in South Asia will continue to center on providing much needed liquidity to private sector companies in the region so they can maintain operations, preserve and create jobs. IFC will also look to further support the region’s most vulnerable people by helping deliver more funding for hard-hit micro, small and medium sized enterprises as well as promoting green growth through investments in sustainable infrastructure, such as renewable energy and digital connectivity, to foster a greener, more resilient, and inclusive recovery from COVID-19. 
""Given the significant shortfall of finances due to COVID and increasing climate emergency, we are using COVID and climate as cross-cutting entry points to find innovative solutions to the clear development challenges in the region,"" said Gomez Ang. 
""We stand with the people and governments of South Asia as we continue to invest in the region's private sector despite market uncertainties. We hope this will send strong signal to other investors and give them confidence to continue to invest in the region."" 
Gomez Ang said IFC’s work to ramp up its investments in climate-related projects was in line with the World Bank Group’s new Climate Change Action Plan, and IFC’s aims to aim to achieve 85% of its new operations to be aligned with the Paris Agreement by 1 July 2023 and 100% of these by 1 July 2025. IFC also sees a $ 2.8 trillion investment opportunity in countries such as India and Bangladesh in rebuilding for a green sustainable future.  
""IFC will continue to prioritise climate investments in the region and help countries meet their nationally determined contributions under the Paris Accord,"" Gomez Ang said. 
""I look forward to continuing our work with the private sector and governments to build back a much more resilient and inclusive society and economy through a greater focus on innovation.""
Gomez Ang previously served as Country Manager for Angola, Mozambique, Zambia, and Botswana, during which time he led the establishment of IFC’s operations in Angola. Prior to that he was Country Manager for Brazil, where he led the repositioning of IFC’s operations through the delivery of a strong investment program and advisory engagements with federal agencies and sub-national governments. 
“Hector brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to his new role that will be incredibly valuable in strengthening our work in South Asia,” said IFC VP – Asia and Pacific Alfonso Garcia Mora.
“Under his leadership, we are confident that we can grow the portfolio in a diversified manner and leverage all of IFC’s products and business lines to support clients and partners in their efforts to build a resilient future in the wake of COVID-19, by advancing critical agendas in climate, gender, and inclusive growth.”
A Mexican national, Gomez Ang joined IFC in Mexico City in 2006 as an Investment Officer, where he led business development in Mexico and Central America. He holds an MBA and Chemical and Systems Engineering degrees from Tecnologico de Monterrey – Mexico and an M.Sc. in Social Business and Entrepreneurship from the London School of Economics.
Gomez Ang succeeds Mengistu Alemayehu, who has assumed a new role as IFC’s Director of Global Equity Mobilisation.

HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles
 

Sri Lanka’s largest retail bank, HNB PLC, achieved another important milestone in its transformation journey, after once again securing its ranking in the prestigious UK-based The Banker Magazine’s Top 1,000 World Banks for the fifth year in a row.
The magazine is the world’s premier banking and finance resource, providing global financial intelligence since 1926. The Banker’s Top 1000 World Banks ranking has set industry benchmarks since 1970, providing comprehensive intelligence about the health and wealth of the banking sector.
“Over the past year, global and local economic networks have been challenged with unprecedented intensity. In an environment of crisis and constrained economic activity, the impetus for strategic responses that support customers while leveraging technology to deliver banking products and services in new, innovative and – above all – efficient – ways has grown even greater. We are proud to state that HNB demonstrated leadership, strength and stability in each of these areas. This sustainable performance helped us to once again earn our place among the Top 1,000 world banks for the fifth consecutive year. This achievement stands as further validation of our team’s resilience and unwavering commitment to excellence,” HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles said.
Notwithstanding the challenging macro conditions, the bank continued to progress on its ambitious transformation journey. HNB’s pivot to digitally-enabled products and services continued to gather momentum, as the bank provided customers with convenient, comprehensive and secured options to transact remotely.
Notably, during the past year, the bank also supported the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to promote the ‘Rata Purama LANKA QR’ campaign across various locations to raise awareness and encourage the public towards cashless payments.
Having already linked LANKA QR to its digital payment app HNB SOLO, the bank was among other financial institutions and telecommunication partners in joining efforts to make cashless QR-code based payments the standard for mobile phones and digital payments countrywide, in moving towards a cashless and digitally-savvy Sri Lanka.
Being a true partner in progress, HNB adopted a proactive approach in providing essential support to its network of retail, corporate and Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) clients negatively impacted by the COVID pandemic. Moreover, to finance a grassroots revival of the Sri Lankan economy, the bank launched a COVID relief fund to provide working capital loans at a concessionary interest rate directly to the bank’s substantial portfolio of SME customers.
The accomplishment follows in the steps of HNB’s other notable accolades, including recognition as the ‘Best Managed Bank during COVID-19 in Sri Lanka’ by the prestigious Asian Banker Magazine, while the bank’s Managing Director and CEO Jonathan Alles was awarded the Leadership Achievement Award for having delivered the Best CEO response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the fourth edition of the South Asian Business Awards 2019 the company was nominated as ‘Emerging Finance Company of the Year’.

He indicated that he was grateful to the Board of Directors for their guidance towards the conduct of business activities of the company and the stakeholders for the trust placed in the company that led to achieving the above stated awards.
He indicated that recognition of the company to grant the aforesaid award by the Global Economics UK, would in turn enhance the reputation of the company among their valued customers, and expressed his appreciation of the contributions made by the staff members of all grades, towards the growth of the company amidst the curfews and travel restrictions enforced by the Government to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Finally, he stated that within a very brief period of time LCB Finance completed all activities for listing on Colombo Stock Exchange for IPO.

The new and enhanced Commercial Bank corporate website has been launched with access to content in English, Sinhala and Tamil, an ultra-smooth interface with interactive multimedia material, enhanced navigation, experience-customisation, smarter search options and tools, and resources that make it extra user-friendly and informative.

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has been conferred the coveted title of ‘Best Bank in Sri Lanka’ for the seventh time by Euromoney, one of the world’s leading financial markets magazines, at its Asia Awards for Excellence 2021. 
The prestigious Euromoney accolade is based on detailed submissions from market participants and extensive year-round research into the banking and capital markets in the region by the magazine’s editors, journalists, and research team.
According to Euromoney, the Asia Awards are seen as the benchmark for the leading firms in financial services in the region and are fiercely contested across numerous markets and categories. This year Euromoney received almost 1,000 submissions from banks for its regional and country awards programme that covers more than 50 regional awards and best bank awards in close to 100 countries.
“This is an award that any bank would be proud to have in its collection,” Commercial Bank Managing Director S. Renganathan commented. “Winning seven, and especially one based on performance in a year dominated by the global pandemic, is a fitting tribute to the strength and mettle of the Bank. It is particularly noteworthy considering the substantial concessions and interest rate cuts we provided to help customers weather the impacts of lockdowns in 2020, as well as the higher impairment provisions we had to make in response to the conditions that prevailed.”
Among the aspects considered for the awards are qualitative and quantitative criteria such as market position, volume of business transacted, new product development, management system, credit ratings, efficiency ratios and annual key performance indicators.
Factors that contributed to Commercial Bank being adjudged the Best Bank in Sri Lanka are key indicators from the bank’s 2020 performance, such as Market Capitalisation, Gross Income, Profit before Tax, Profit after Tax, Total Assets, Total Deposits, Gross Loans, Market Share of Deposits, Market Share of Loans and CASA Ratio.
Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC is the largest private sector commercial bank, and the third largest bank overall in Sri Lanka in terms of total assets, which stood at Rs 1.736 trillion ($ 9.285 billion) as at the end of 2020. It is the only private sector bank that has been designated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as a higher-tier Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB). The Bank accounted for approximately 10.7%, 11.2% and 11.8% of sector Loans and Advances, Deposits and Assets respectively in 2020.
The bank’s asset quality is one of the best in the industry, while its Current Accounts and Savings Accounts (CASA) made up 42.72% of total deposits in 2020, the highest among the peer banks.
The bank launched 18 new products and services in pandemic impacted 2020 demonstrating its spirit in the face of adversity. Notably, six of these products were groundbreaking firsts of their kind in Sri Lanka.
Commercial Bank was also one of the leading banks in the country in providing pandemic relief to its customers. The bank implemented its own relief schemes for different customer segments in addition to complying with Central Bank mandated concessions and reduced interest rates across all categories of loans by approximately 4% to 5% p.a. during the first half of 2020.
Euromoney’s Awards for Excellence were established in 1992 and were the first of their kind in the global banking industry. The Euromoney Magazine was created in 1969 to cover the re-emergence of the international cross-border capital markets. Euromoney reports on and champions global capital markets and their growth, and in the process has become the prime magazine of the wholesale financial world, its institutions and users.

MUMBAI (Reuters): The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday indefinitely barred Mastercard Inc. from issuing new debit or credit cards to domestic customers for violating data storage rules, dealing a blow to the US company in a key market.
In a notification, the RBI said Mastercard had not complied with data storage rules from 2018 that require foreign card networks to store Indian payments data ‘only in India’ so the regulator can have ‘unfettered supervisory access’.
“Notwithstanding lapse of considerable time and adequate opportunities being given, the entity (Mastercard) has been found to be non-compliant with the directions,” the RBI said.
Mastercard said it was ‘disappointed’ with the RBI’s decision and that it had provided regular updates on its compliance with the rules since 2018.
“We will continue to work with them to provide any additional details required to resolve their concerns,” it said in a statement late Wednesday.
The ban takes effect on 22 July.
The move comes less than three months after India’s central bank barred American Express and Diners Club International, owned by Discover Financial Services, from issuing new cards due to similar violations.
But unlike American Express, which is a relatively small player in India, companies such as Mastercard and Visa have partnered with many Indian banks that offer cards using the US firms’ payments network.
In 2019, Mastercard said it was ‘bullish on India’, announcing $ 1 billion in investment over the next five years, in addition to its earlier investment of $ 1 billion from 2014-2019.
“It does leave a big vacuum in credit cards and can come as a good opportunity for Visa ... Banks will have to start re-negotiating the deals and this will be a blow for Mastercard,” said Ashvin Parekh, an independent financial services consultant.
The RBI’s decision will not impact existing customers of Mastercard, and the company should advise all card issuing banks in India to comply with the order, the RBI added.
The RBI directive in 2018 sparked an aggressive lobbying effort from US companies, which said the rules would increase their infrastructure costs and hit their global fraud detection platforms, but the central bank did not relent.
The order comes as companies such as Mastercard and Visa also face growing competition from domestic payments network Rupay, which has been promoted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
In 2018, Mastercard told the US government that New Delhi’s protectionist policies were hurting foreign payment companies, Reuters has previously reported.

A partnership initiated by the GIZ SME Development project in Sri Lanka, on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), with leading insurance provider, SANASA Life Insurance Company (SLIC) has created history by becoming the first-ever company to reinstate the life insurance policies for over 21,000 farmers and SMEs. 
This was an effort to mitigate the devastating effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown imposed across the country in March 2020, that resulted in these two groups being among the worst-affected. 
The partnership between SLIC and GIZ began in 2018 with the development of the iFarm mobile application. It was an effort made to provide for the agriculture insurance product, to address the adverse effects of changing climate conditions. The app was designed to ensure that farmers would not have to travel to claim insurance coverage and would be re-imbursed within a short timeframe. 
When the country went into lockdown, the companies saw an opportunity to extend their partnership beyond digitalising the agriculture insurance reach. The partnership reinstated insurance policies for those individuals or smallholder businesses who had let it lapse due to inability to pay the premiums. To further reduce the credit risk and attain a smooth claiming process in future, SLIC and GIZ also widened the introduction of the policyholders to the iFarm application.
GIZ Sri Lanka Country Director Christiane Einfeldt highlighted the importance of collaboration within the public and private sector, especially in times of crisis to mitigate some of the effects. “It is imperative that both the public and private sectors work in tandem to support the Small and Medium Enterprises and agriculture communities during this time of need. Access to markets and technologies for the agriculture communities has always been a priority for GIZ and would continue to implement such measures,” she said.
SLIC has always taken its role as a leading corporate citizen who is focused on the wellbeing of its stakeholder community and the people. In addition to the reinstating of the lapsed policies, the SLIC team has gone a step further in helping the people of the country by introducing a Rs. 1 million free COVID-19 cover, for any new life insurance policy. 
SANASA Life Chief Executive Officer Indika Kiriwandeniya stated, “We all know that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused great hardship to millions of Sri Lankans. Our customers who depend on small businesses for their monthly income were suddenly left with no funds to even buy food, let alone their insurance premiums. As a company that believes in helping people in their hour of need, to help these 21,000+ farmers and policyholders to face the future with confidence now that their pending premiums have been settled and their life insurance policies have been reinstated. 
SANASA Life Insurance has been a giant in the field of insurance in Sri Lanka for nearly 30 years. It was established for the purpose of giving relief to the people of rural areas who met with accidents. In October 1991 All Lanka Mutual Assurance Organization (ALMAO) was established and the monthly fee was set to a small sum of Rs. 5 to 20 and thereby the foundation for an immense insurance company was laid. 
In 2003, SANASA obtained the license to operate as a Life Insurance company and two years later acquired the license to operate as a General Insurance company. Today, SANASA is one of the leading insurance service providers in Sri Lanka providing thousands of job opportunities to the younger generation.

MDRT is the highest global standard in ethical and informed client servicing, something we actively work to achieve in a global environment and industry where professionalism is paramount, particularly due to the absence of organic demand for life insurance. 
“Therefore, I believe the professionals we groom remain our greatest strength and this recognition reiterates our commitment to continuously invest in them through the best training, advanced technological support and opportunities for career progression. This also underscores Softlogic Life’s deep commitment towards innovating and our efforts to keep pushing the bar towards world-class insurance standards,” remarked Softlogic Life Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed.
Serving over 1.5 million clients across Sri Lanka, Softlogic Life enjoys a superior position in the country’s highly competitive insurance landscape.

This strategic business model fosters consistency, strong and professional customer relationships, and encourages the use of carefully curated digital tools to enhance their service. 
Quarterly evaluations are also conducted to identify and rectify challenges advisors face during their time in the field, while a team of experienced sales members are deployed to support and mentor new advisors to overcome roadblocks successfully. With the rapid global shift to the new normal, the company was among the first organisations to introduce a frictionless service experience across the board through strategic digital integration, requiring less paperwork and physical interaction.

Following in-depth research and with a view to addressing current market conditions, AIA Insurance recently redesigned and launched its flagship savings product, AIA Smart Wealth, enhancing its value and proposition to Sri Lankans. 
The newly designed, Smart Wealth enables you to create, manage and protect your wealth. It combines the best of savings with life insurance while providing a significant amount of flexibility to customers. 
Backed by the professional and prudent investment management capabilities of AIA, Smart Wealth invests in a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds/fixed income investments and government securities which are invested for the long term. The investment strategy is designed to provide customers a solid return on their long-term savings. AIA Insurance’s track record of providing superior returns (declared dividend for 2020 was 9.18%) is further backed by an annual guarantee which is currently at 8% for 2021. 
The redesigned saving solution offers customers the choice of customising the amount of life insurance protection they need. Smart Wealth comes standard with a life insurance cover of five times the Annualised Premium, but customers may choose to add more life insurance – up to 50 times the Annualised Premium, along with an Accident Insurance Cover. 
In the unfortunate event of death or Total Permanent Disability, AIA will immediately pay the insurance benefits to your loved ones AND will continue to pay your premium on your behalf so that your loved ones will receive the maturity as you intended. This is a unique feature where customers get the benefit of protection and maturity in case the life assured passes away.
Unlike traditional life insurance products, which require long-term premium paying commitments, AIA Smart Wealth suits customers who are saving for the long term (up to 20 years) but only want to make payments for four or six years. The new product also offers, for the first time, a 15-year policy term version (six years of premium payments for 15 years of protection), providing greater choice to our customers. 
AIA Smart Wealth has a special loyalty reward of up to 450% of the Annualised Basic Premium depending on the Policy Term and Premium Paying Term which is added to the savings fund on the 15th and 20th year for 20-year Policy Terms and at maturity for 10 and 15 year Policy Terms. This Loyalty Reward enhances your savings and allows you to build a solid investment for your needs.
The choice and flexibility continue even after maturity. Not all of us want our funds as a lumpsum, so AIA Smart Wealth, after maturity, allows you to receive your savings as a growing monthly income for a period of 5 to 30 years. This monthly option is ideal for people looking for a retirement solution or to provide a monthly income to a loved one. This monthly income is further increased by AIA’s unique Dividend Booster feature which pays 30% more of the Annual Dividend Rate. 
These are just a few of the many benefits offered by this product, not to forget the annually guaranteed dividend payment that AIA customers receive, with a track record of consistently being above the promised amount. AIA Smart Wealth is brought to you by AIA Sri Lanka, a leader in life insurance, providing health, pensions and savings solutions and the Best Life Insurance Company in Sri Lanka for 2019 and 2020 (according to Global Banking and Finance Review).

The full team behind the initiative at ICTA, NDB, and PayMedia 
 







PayMedia Founder and CEO Kanishka Weeramunda


 





NDB Kohuwala Branch Manager Kuraish Sappidin




Recently, the ICTA unveiled a credit scoring framework as part of its efforts to support startups. Developed in partnership with PwC, the framework helps banks identify the creditworthiness of startups that apply for loans.

The initiative addresses a fundamental issue that has hindered the growth of Sri Lankan tech startups. Already, it has begun helping local startups. Recently, local fintech startup PayMedia secured an Rs. 85 million loan from NDB because the bank adopted this framework.
Since its founding in 2014, the startup has worked closely with the banking industry. The company was the first to introduce real-time cash deposit machines to Sri Lanka and has developed a range of payments solutions. Over the years, the company has won several awards for these products. It has also launched a subsidiary called DirectPay, which specialises in digital payments and recently crossed the milestone of processing Rs. 3 billion payments.
Despite its close relations with the banks, it was a time-consuming process to get funding from them. Kanishka elaborated, saying, “It can take anywhere between four to six months to get a response. After four months, then you’ll hear, ‘We’ll fund 50% of the project.’ But as a startup, you can’t do anything with that because you need the remainder too.”
The new credit scoring framework helps bridge the gap between Sri Lankan banks and startups. ICTA had developed it working with PwC alongside an industry-led steering committee. The framework evaluates startups based on four key factors. They are the capability of the founders and management team, market potential of the startup, its product/service, and financial health of the startup. By focusing on these four factors, it’s now possible for banks to analyse a startups’ intangible assets when assessing its creditworthiness. 
Several banks have started looking at implementing the framework to give loans to startups. Among the first banks to adopt it is NDB bank. Speaking to Arteculate, NDB Kohuwala Branch Manager Kuraish Sappidin commented, “This framework is a positive move from the ICTA and PwC for the growth of the banking industry. It offers a great opportunity for startups to work with the banks and grow their business.” 
As a startup founder, Kanishka describes the framework as a game-changer. Thanks to it, PayMedia secured an Rs. 85 million loan from NDB. He went onto share, “In the past, funding from banks was out of the question for startups. The most viable option was giving up equity to investors. But now a founder doesn’t need to give up equity or provide collateral to obtain funding.” As the Sri Lankan technology industry grows, the credit scoring framework by ICTA and PwC removes a key barrier for the continued growth of startups. Moreover, with PayMedia obtaining the Rs. 85 million loan from NDB, the road ahead looks optimistic.

Awards such as this give us added impetus to recommit ourselves to delivering greater value to our customers and all other stakeholders, as we continue to present their future.”

Emerald Sri Lanka Fund exits investment in Panasian Power 
 

Emerald Sri Lanka Fund, a pioneering private equity fund that supports small and mid-sized businesses in Sri Lanka, has announced its divestment in Panasian Power PLC (PAP), one of Sri Lanka’s leading renewable energy solution providers and suppliers of clean

energy to the national grid. Emerald Sri Lanka Fund, along with other major shareholders, sold a 62% stake of PAP to RIL Property PLC (RIL), a Sri Lankan conglomerate, for a total sale value of Rs. 1.7 billion. NDB Investment Bank acted as the exclusive financial advisor to the consortium of divesting shareholders and carried out a competitive M&A process to select RIL Property PLC as the successful investor.
The exit comes on the heels of strong growth by Panasian Power in the last two years. Since Emerald Sri Lanka Fund’s investment in Panasian Power, the company doubled its energy generation capacity to 22 megawatts. The expansion was mainly led by solar projects. Despite COVID-related disruptions to the Sri Lankan economy, Panasian Power recorded 63% increase in net profit in the fiscal year ending March 2021. Commenting on the growth of the Fund’s portfolio company, NDB Capital Holdings CEO and Panasian Power PLC Director Senaka Kakiriwaragodage said: “PAP is on the forefront of generating affordable and sustainable energy for Sri Lanka. It has been an incredible journey working with the shareholders and management team towards achieving the company’s growth objectives. On the back of its execution capabilities, Panasian Power has a strong project pipeline with plans to expand to over 30 megawatts within the next year and has already initiated expansion opportunities in overseas markets. We are excited to see the company’s sustainable growth even after our exit.”
The Emerald Sri Lanka Fund is the first institutional private equity fund dedicated to Sri Lanka. It was launched by NDB Zephyr Partners Ltd. (NDB Zephyr), to provide growth capital and management support to SMEs led by promising entrepreneurs. After investment, the fund assists its portfolio companies via active participation in areas such as strategic planning, management development, financial management, corporate governance, environment and social compliance and operational efficiencies. In July 2019, the Fund invested Rs. 400 million in PAP.
Commenting on the partnership with Emerald Sri Lanka Fund, Panasian Power PLC CEO and Executive Director Pathmanatha Poddiwala said: “The Emerald Sri Lanka Fund team has been a terrific partner as we’ve grown the business. The Fund’s arrival was the key milestone in the company to achieve its strategic target of diversifying into rooftop and ground-mounted solar power which made Panasian Power the most competitive IPP as per recent solar PV tender. Beyond the capital, the team’s local presence in Sri Lanka coupled with their global connections has been invaluable to us in terms of growing our pipeline and accelerating our international expansion. We appreciate their guidance to mark our presence in our first overseas hydro project in Zambia under Get-Fit scheme and achieving success on unique concepts like solar with agriculture for the first time in the country. I must specially thank Senaka Kakiriwaragodage for the dynamic role he played in the board and in key sub-committees such as the investment and audit committee to add significant value on financial reporting while strengthening best practices and corporate governance. ”
The Emerald Sri Lanka Fund’s investments span across food and beverages, IT, consumer goods, leisure and construction sectors. This exit serves an important purpose invalidating the private equity concept in Sri Lanka where a Fund will invest, build and harvest by selecting scalable businesses that require growth capital and spurring growth in such companies. This process results in the creation of strong corporate entities and benefits the broader economy whilst generating attractive returns to its investors. Having followed the same investment process, Emerald Fund is currently managing its second exit in JAT Holdings Ltd., another portfolio company in the Private Equity Fund. This exit is being facilitated as JAT Holdings taps the public capital markets through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) as an innovative corporate entity with an international presence.
Emerald Fund is managed by NDB Zephyr Partners Ltd. which is jointly owned by NDB Capital Holdings Ltd., leading investment banking group in Sri Lanka, and Zephyr Management, L.P, a New York-based global emerging markets investment firm. 
The M&A Process of Panasian Power PLC was managed by NDB Investment Bank, also a subsidiary of NDB Capital. NDB Capital, NDB Zephyr and NDB Investment Bank belong to the largest financial conglomerate in Sri Lanka, the NDB Banking Group. NDB Bank, crowned as ‘Sri Lanka’s Best Bank 2021’ by the prestigious Global Finance Magazine of USA, fresh on the heels of being recognised as ‘The Bank of the Year Sri Lanka’, by The Banker Magazine UK, is the fourth largest listed bank in Sri Lanka and the parent company of the NDB Group. 
The only financial services conglomerate in Sri Lanka, NDB Group is uniquely positioned towards assisting the growth and development of the Sri Lankan capital market to provide its customers seamless access to the product and service offerings of all its group companies.

158% increase in volume of transactions across digital payment channels
Number of transactions on digital channels increase by 153%
Decisive shift in preference for contactless and cashless payment solutions
Over 250 enterprises successfully digitalised processes after onset of the pandemic

Resistance to cashless transactions has rapidly given way to enthusiastic usage as an unprecedented number of Sri Lankans are switching to digital banking channels, according to HNB Head of Cards Gauthami Niranjan.
Compared with 2020, the volume of transactions on digital channels grew by a remarkable 158% Year-on-Year (YoY) in 2021, while the value of digital transactions increased by a corresponding 153% YoY.
“Given that HNB had already captured the lion’s share of the market in digital merchant acquisition even before the pandemic, we leveraged these experiences to ensure that even businesses which were initially unsure of digital payments were able to seamlessly adapt and integrate these technologies into their total business model. The results of these efforts are compelling as reflected in the massive uptake in digital payment options- both from customers and businesses,” Niranjan said.
HNB IPG (Internet Payment Gateway) recorded a growth over 100% in merchants during the period, with businesses embracing the secure payment channel and services offered by the bank for online payments from any local or international debit, credit, VISA and MasterCard.
Similarly, merchants improved their cashless payment options with HNB MOMO, especially for cash on delivery services. As a result, the mobile solution for electronic payment cards holds a 50% market share in low-cost mobile POS terminals in Sri Lanka.
Such a rapid proliferation of digital payments creates a compelling financial incentive for almost any enterprise – particularly as an affinity for cashless transactions expands out of major urban centres and into all parts of the country.
“Developments in cashless payments are still only emerging. However, technologies like tokenisation – technology at the heart of ride-hailing and food delivery apps – is likely to expand in the coming months as more local businesses launch dedicated apps with payment features built-in. This is another area in which we have supported some of the most successful tech-based enterprises in the country by enabling card details to be securely linked to convenient payment portals.
“These dynamics will ultimately provide valuable and much-needed benefits for a broad spectrum of Sri Lankan enterprise – from small businesses and self-employed individuals to hospitality providers, large and small – and ultimately promote a broader and more resilient and equitable economic recovery. 
“However, the barrier for entry into a digital transaction has never been lower, and our goal is to make sure that all Sri Lankan enterprises can compete in this new paradigm,” Niranjan concluded.

“With the increasing trend towards ‘Fintech’ solutions, LOLC is confident that this groundbreaking product will be the most sought-after working capital solution in the industry because it has been designed to give optimum convenience to customers who are especially engaged in dynamic MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) businesses”.

Seated: Ajith Senadheera (NDB), Priyantha Samaradiwakara (NTB), Kanchana Karunagama (HNB), Shiyan Perera (PABC), Dilum Amarasinghe (Seylan Bank), Jeewantha Perera (Union Bank).  
Absent: Damayanthi Subasinghe (BOC), J. Munasinghe (RDB) 

The 5th AGM of the LCBSL (Leasing Council of Bankers of Sri Lanka) was held recently, where Kanchana Karunagama was appointed as the new President, taking over from outgoing President Gillian Edwards.    
The LCBSL was formed in the year 2015 as a measure to protect and improve the standards of the leasing industry within the banking sector. Improving customer friendliness of the leasing product, improving the technical knowledge on the product among sales and credit staff of banks, ensuring related services such as valuations are up to standard, and improving the common understanding and engagement of the banking industry on the leasing product and forming a common voice and representation to engage with Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Government and other stakeholders were among the key priorities of LCBSL. 
The presence of the LCBSL created immense value for all members and the industry at large during the periods of unprecedented challenges faced in the last few years and created a common platform of engagement for all banks to contribute towards the economic development of the country.  
Sharing his views on the future activities of LCBSL, incoming President Kanchana Karunagama said: “Leasing is a very popular mode of finance, specially among the retail and SME segments, and banks offer comparatively lower interest rates than others. The exposure of banks and contribution to these segments have immensely contributed to expanding many sectors in the economy of the country. 
“The importance of leasing product needs to be highlighted among all stakeholders whilst maintaining its more attractive features. The product is more secured with many benefits, including a strong contribution to the bottom line of any bank, with added advantages such as depreciation etc. 
“We would like to work close with regulatory bodies with a view of further streamlining this product with more attractive benefits to the lessees. Also, we have planned to work close with many government and private sector organisations in further popularising the Leasing product. I am confident with my able team to take this association forward for the betterment of the banking sector and current and potential customers.”
New President Karunugama is ably supported by the senior office bearers, which includes the three Vice Presidents namely, Shiyan Perera (PABC), Dilum Amarasinghe (Seylan Bank) and Priyantha Samaradiwakara (NTB), who will be in-charge of broader areas covering Public Relations, Technical and Training respectively. Jeewantha Perera (Union Bank) serves as the General Secretary and Ajith Senadheera (NDB Bank) serves as the Treasurer.  
All member Banks are represented in the committee, ensuring the required share of voice.

The All Share Price Index gained by 17 points and S&P SL20 gained by five points. Turnover was Rs. 1.35 billion involving 1.37 million shares.  
First Capital said the bourse restored its position in the green pitch, regaining an optimistic sentiment while registering an index high of one week. 
“Despite the ASPI witnessing a short-lived dip at 7,776 in the first 26 minutes of trading, the index recovered with a steady rise that lasted the remainder of the session, eventually reaching an intraday high at 7,836, before closing at 7,809,” First Capital said. 
It said turnover was led by the Capital Goods sector closely followed by the Diversified Financials sector accounting for a joint contribution of 53%. 
Asia Securities said following an initial decline, the ASPI picked up gradually as the index surpassed the 7,800-level led by price gains in index-heavy counters such as NIFL, LOLC and JKH. 
Turnover topped in JKH, driven by foreign selling in the stock while overall activity remained at yesterday’s levels. 
The Capital Goods, Diversified Financials, Food, Beverage and Tobacco and Utilities sectors led activity, collectively accounting for 66.9% of turnover. 
Asia said foreigners recorded a net outflow of Rs. 336.2 million while their participation increased to 14.7% of turnover (previous day 9.6%). Estimated net foreign buying topped in LVEF at Rs. 5.3 million and net foreign selling topped in JKH at Rs. 243 million.

Mixed interest was observed in John Keells Holdings, LOLC Holdings and Windforce Ltd., whilst retail interest was noted in Panasian Power, People’s Leasing and Finance and Browns Investments. Furthermore, foreigners closed as net sellers mainly due to foreign selling in John Keells Holdings.
The Capital Goods sector was the top contributor to the market turnover (due to John Keells Holdings), whilst the sector index gained 0.22%. The share price of John Keells Holdings increased by Rs. 0.25 (0.19%) closing at Rs. 131.25, whilst foreign holdings decreased by 1,851,277 shares.

Alliance Finance Co. PLC (AFC) has renewed its partnership with FMO; the Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank, by receiving a fresh funding line of $ 10 million in June 2021 to financially empower and facilitate the development of the Micro, Small and Medium enterprise sector in Sri Lanka. 
The AFC-FMO partnership began in 2018 and AFC was successful in obtaining $ 10 million, which enabled AFC to finance over 15,000 MSME entrepreneurs in building up their livelihoods. In addition to FMO, AFC also has partnerships with reputed institutions such as Triodos, Symbiotics, DWM and IFC and has successfully raised over $ 40 million to date. AFC’s sustainable business philosophy focused on sustainable development was the key to attracting these development finance institutions and impact investors. 
Commenting on this important milestone, AFC Deputy Chairman and Managing Director Romani De Silva stated, “This is a reflection of the confidence that FMO has in the business philosophy of our company and our commitment to sustainable development. It is also an indication of FMO’s commitment to supporting rural communities in Sri Lanka during these tough and challenging times amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We are very grateful to FMO for coming forward to assist our MSME customers who need our support now more than ever.” 
The MSME sector is a significant contributor that can fuel the anticipated economic development of the country. However, the challenges and constraints hindering their ability to reach their true potential has remained more or less unchanged throughout. Finance, being one of the key inputs for development has always been insufficient for this sector given that 48% of borrowers in Sri Lanka yet borrow from family, friends and unregulated sources. Thus, the need to close the funding gap in this sector remains a key development priority in the country and a key focus area of the providers of financial services.
AFC, from its inception in 1956, has successfully dedicated its business to serve the small and medium level enterprises in Sri Lanka by providing financial solutions to facilitate their development. Thus, at this juncture where the attention is refocusing on the MSME and SME sector, AFC is equipped with a well-aligned business philosophy and years of experience to effectively cater to this need in collaboration with other providers of financial services thus helping to close the existing funding gap in the MSME sector. 
AFC’s commitment to sustainability is holistic and goes beyond economic empowerment with an equal emphasis placed upon social and environmental sustainability as well. AFC embraced the triple bottom line approach in 2012, followed by numerous other actions to become the sustainable financial institution it is today. 
In 2020 AFC became the first financial institution in South Asia to be certified for holistic sustainability under the pioneering Sustainability Standards and Certification Initiative (SSCI). SSCI is governed under the International Council of Sustainability Standards for Value-Driven Financial Institutions, Germany. This has resulted in an even greater focus on this unwavering commitment of the Company and better measurements of the impact created. 
AFC is also among the highest contributors of net profits towards sustainability initiatives in the industry. The Company has dedicated an annual allocation of 3% of profits to conduct sustainability and CSR initiatives. The company has many initiatives including the ‘1 mn trees for Unity’ flagship project, that aims to plant one million trees by 2024 whilst meeting social and environmental objectives. 
To-date the company has contributed over 300,000 plants to the nation. In addition, conserving biodiversity, empowering social entrepreneurs, promoting sustainable products and undertaking CSR practices that ensure social and environmental wellbeing are some of the other key priorities of the mandate that continue despite the challenges brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic.
AFC will also continue to support the global and local sustainable development movements, with its high impact goals in place to ensure focused value creation in line with the UN SDG’s and National Development Agenda. AFC believes that synergistic partnerships with organisations such as FMO and other impact investors will add further value to its approach and facilitate value distribution to a wider range of stakeholders in the country. AFC is eager to uphold these partnerships and collaborations that facilitate sustainable development in Sri Lanka and have confidence that they will undoubtedly accelerate its journey of ‘making the world a better place through sustainable finance’.

These new offerings are part of a 10-year exclusive bancassurance distribution agreement signed between the Allianz Group and HSBC covering key markets in Asia such as Australia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Sri Lanka.
The ‘Global Health Medical Insurance’ cover allows HSBC’s Premier customers to enjoy world-class health care with an exclusive cover ranging from $ 800,000 to $ 1,500,000 at a special annual premium from Allianz Insurance.
Premier customers are also eligible for a special 12.5% discount on premiums for families with three or more members. 
The exclusive travel insurance plan namely ‘Student Companion’, gives parents the peace of mind that their children are protected and can stay on track to follow their dreams and achieve their goals while overseas. HSBC Premier customers can opt for a Student Companion travel insurance plan ranging from $ 50,000 to $ 200,000 at a special annual premium offered by Allianz Insurance.  HSBC Premier customers can enjoy the flexibility of paying their annual insurance premiums with 0% interest on instalments of Rs. 30,000 and above made upfront at the Allianz Lanka Head Office and Allianz Customer Care Centre - Borella. Customers residing outside Colombo, can avail the same when they purchase policies from Allianz Lanka branch offices, using the payment link that will be emailed to them by the insurer.

Allianz Insurance Lanka Chief Executive Officer Gany Subramaniam said: “Consumers and businesses around the world are very conscious about the current global health environment and the financial implications it brings. As a responsible insurer who always strives to help secure people’s lives and give them courage by being behind them for what is ahead, we believe we have a greater responsibility to support them during these trying times in relation to their global health and wellness needs.

Therefore, we have partnered with Allianz Insurance to offer our customers and their family an exclusive Global Health Insurance cover to provide them with access to the best possible healthcare. We have also made Global Insurance more affordable with our flexible payment plans on HSBC Premier Credit Cards.”

It said moderate turnover was led by the Capital Goods sector followed by the Diversified Financials sector accounting for a joint contribution of 51%. Parcel trades accounted for 18% of the turnover. 
Asia Securities said the ASPI commenced the session with a gap-up of 65 points, however the index reversed early gains as it gradually declined to below 7,800 level, on the back of price losses in index-heavy counters NIFL, JKH and LOLC.

Mixed interest was observed in Cargills, LOLC Holdings and Dipped Products, whilst retail interest was noted in Lanka Orix Finance, Commercial Leasing & Finance and Browns Investments.

LB CIM (Cash-In-Mobile), the popular mobile wallet solution offered by LB Finance PLC recently reached an important milestone by surpassing Rs. 10 billion worth of cumulative transactions. This is a commendable achievement given this milestone has come in just 20 months since its commercial launch, in a market now crowded with over 20 similar products vying aggressively for market share and customer growth.  
During that period, CIM has powered over 2.3 million transactions digitally, a clear testament to the value and the convenience CIM offers to its customers and demonstrates Sri Lanka’s rapid progress in embracing digital payments across all spheres.
Speaking on this milestone achievement, LB Finance Head of Strategy and Digital Finance Bimal Perera stated, “We are humbled by this achievement and encouraged with the momentum of digital adoption among our core target groups. CIM goes beyond being just another mobile payment platform by offering a very high level of integration with our core banking system. This uniqueness enables our valued customers to enjoy unhindered access to their portfolio of lease, loans and deposit accounts through one single digital platform.” 
LB CIM is proud to be one of the few trilingual mobile wallets available in the market and champions the concept of simplicity in its UI/UX offering. The company believes CIM’s ultra-simple design gives it an advantage over the completion to become a truly inclusive digital payment solution to Sri Lankan masses
LB CIM smartphone application is available for Android and iOS-based devices. It comes in the form of two separate mobile apps; ‘CIM Customer App’ and ‘CIM Business App’, to cater to the specific needs of customers and retail merchants. The CIM customer app functions as an interest-bearing digital savings account (4.0% p.a.), also performs the role of mobile wallet capable of making contactless payments at over 220,000+ Lanka QR merchants island-wide. Customers can use the CIM app to transfer money instantly up to Rs. 5,000,000 per instance to any bank, perform instant airtime top-ups, pay credit cards, insurance premiums, and utility bills, etc.
CIM business app functions as a platform for retail merchants to develop their businesses by managing their business cash flows more efficiently and securely, while earning interest on the digital savings account. Through CIM business app, LB Finance expects to include Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) to the formal financial services and offer them an opportunity to avail working capital credit to develop their businesses.
CIM mobile wallet is an ambitious initiative by LB Digital Financial Services (DFS), a specialised unit that combines the strength and heritage of a five decades old financial institution with the entrepreneurial spirit of a fintech start-up. LB DFS plans to further enhance the value proposition of CIM to position it as the country’s most inclusive digital financing solution. 
From its humble beginnings in 1971, LB Finance has seen remarkable growth over the last five decades, establishing itself as Sri Lanka’s leading non-banking financier today. A hallmark of its success has been the company’s ability to adopt and innovate its product and service offerings to cater to the ever-changing needs of the local consumer. The company believes the agility and the dynamism in its business model are the key attributes in sustaining its performance at the highest level in this highly competitive financial services space.

PARIS, AFP: Some 130 countries reached a historic deal Thursday that would see massive multinational firms pay their fair share of taxes.
But the deal won’t be finalised until October, with some tough work ahead to bring in recalcitrant countries.

How was the deal reached? 
In order to get on board the developed countries who have seen their tax revenue leak away, as well as sceptical emerging nations and countries which have benefited from ultra-low tax rates, a number of compromises were necessary.
While the deal foresees an effective minimum 15% tax rate – that is to say that the amount actually levied and paid – there will still be a few loopholes to reduce that.
Countries will still be able to offer incentives to encourage companies to set up production facilities. Developing nations will still be able to benefit from breaks foreseen in bilateral treaties.
And the text’s provisions concerning a redistribution of profits to countries where companies do most of their business will only apply to the top hundred or so multinationals.
But to assuage developing countries it was agreed that after seven years the number of companies subject to this provision will grow.
That means developing countries will likely see more revenue heading their way and that helped bring India, Turkey and Argentina on board.
The measures are considered insufficient, however, by the anti-poverty NGO Oxfam, which believes the deal is still skewed towards rich nations.
But one of the key negotiators behind the deal, the head of tax policy at the OECD, Pascal Saint-Amans, said “the agreement is very good for developing countries, it has major advances for them.” 

Next steps 
The next step will be a meeting of G20 nations on 9 and 10 July.
While the OECD-brokered deal of 130 countries takes out some of the drama, as all of the G20 nations are on board, the meeting can help maintain political momentum.
Not only do the nations have plenty of technical details to work out before the self-imposed October deadline (with a hoped-for 2023 start date), they still want to bring hold-outs on board.
Another potential obstacle is the US Congress, where Republicans are opposed to the deal and could sink it in the Senate.

Who are the holdouts? 
Of the 139 nations that participated in the talks, nine didn’t sign up to the deal: Ireland, Hungary, Estonia, Peru, Nigeria, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Barbados and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
Except for Peru, which abstained due to a domestic political crisis, the other nations use low tax rates to attract multinationals.
Nigeria and Kenya believed the guarantees offered to developing countries were insufficient, according to a source involved in the negotiations.
Ireland said it supported the measure to redistribute taxes paid by multinationals among nations where they do business, but opposed the minimum 15% effective tax rate.
Hungary said the 15% tax rate is far too high and would weigh on economic activity.
France, which takes over the rotating EU presidency in January, hopes to get the two nations plus Estonia on board so the bloc can adopt a minimum tax provision.
What points are outstanding? 
Even if the OECD deal was much more detailed than hoped, there are plenty of issues to work out.
One of the most contentious may be the exact tax rate: the text of the agreement currently reads “at least 15%”, but many states don’t want anything higher.
The calculation of the amount of taxes that can be redistributed also needs to be detailed.
As do some points concerning exemptions from the minimum tax rate.

Assuring its stability and reaffirming firm’s commitment to equity market investing
JB Vantage’s Unit Trust recognised by CFA for fifth year







JB Financial CEO Christine Dias Bandaranaike 

 




The JB Vantage Value Equity Fund was recognised as the Best Unit Trust Fund at the eighth annual CFA Capital Market Awards, held virtually recently in Colombo. This is the third year JB Vantage Unit Trusts have won the Gold award in the Best Unit Trust category in the five years the awards have been held. 
This recognition has been given for the best practices implemented in asset management. In the past five years JB Vantage has also received one Silver and three Bronze awards in the Unit Trust Category at the CFA Awards. 
Speaking of the win JB Financial CEO Christine Dias Bandaranaike said, “It is always a great honour for us to be recognised by CFA Sri Lanka. We find the award process encourages us to strive to be better each year. This recognition once again is a testament that JB Vantage’s prudent investment philosophy, concentrating on strong fundamentals and resilient earnings, has proven to be the best recipe for our success. The past couple of years have been extraordinary with all the uncertain economic conditions. We believe that this award will add to our credentials and build further trust and confidence from the general public.”
She added: “This highly regarded award reflects JB Vantage’s continuous quest for improvement and transparency, of which we are very proud. We adopt a culture of excellence and the strength of our business is rooted in our focus on our clients and our people. We are the only fund manager in Sri Lanka to adhere to both the Asset Manager Code and the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) – two rigorous best practices recommended by the CFA Institute.”
JB Vantage Value Equity Fund Portfolio Manager Murtaza Jafferjee, CFA said, “We are humbled to have been recognised by our peers for this award. We are also acutely aware that excellence is a journey not a destination and thus continue to strive to improve.”
The main objective of the Capital Market Awards, organised by CFA Society Sri Lanka is to encourage and reward industry professionals who introduce and adhere to strong standards of excellence in the capital market under five categories – Best Equity Research Report, Best Sector Report, Best Investor Relations, Best Stock Broker Research Firm, and Best Unit Trust.  
In the Best Unit Trust category the CFA Institute’s Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct is used to award points to the Unit Trust that has best followed its standards. The JB Vantage fund management team was recognised for putting investors first; full disclosure of risks and ensuring its funds are driven by efficient market fundamentals. 
The firm’s flagship product is its JB Vantage Money Market fund, another CFA Sri Lanka Gold award winner. Earlier this year the fund received a credit risk rating of [SL]A+mfs from ICRA Lanka Ltd. The fund is the second-largest Money Market Fund in terms of assets under management (AUM) in Sri Lanka with Rs. 21.49 billion as of end March 2021. The fund was initiated on 4 August 2011 and has been in existence for nearly a decade consistently outperforming the benchmark (NDBIB CRISIL 91-day T-bill Index). Deutsche Bank AG acts as the trustee of the JB Vantage Unit Trusts which are licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka. 
CFA Sri Lanka is the local affiliate of the CFA Institute, the premier global association of investment professionals. The CFA Institute stands for creating an environment where investors’ interests come first and markets function at their best.

The Colombo stock market began a fresh week on a dull note with indices moving the opposite direction amidst low turnover. 
The All Share Price Index increased 47.6 points or 0.6%, aided by gains in illiquid stocks (LOLC Development Finance rose by 23% or Rs. 104.75 to Rs. 567, thereby contributing 56 points to ASPI's gain), whilst the S&P SL20 declined by 18 points or 0.6%. 
Turnover was Rs. 1.4 billion involving 43.7 million shares. 
First Capital said overall, the bourse started off the week on a positive footing, retaining its position in the green pitch for the second consecutive day on the back of illiquid stocks. 
“ASPI surged at an intraday high of 7,814, reflecting significant investor enthusiasm within the first 25 minutes of the session. However, the market thereafter displayed a gradual downward trend during mid-day and afterwards regained its upward momentum over the second half of the session, closing at 7,794,” First Capital said.

Asia Securities said the ASPI commenced the session sharply, surpassing the 7,800 level before witnessing a gradual decline. However, the index picked up during the closing hours due to price gains in NIFL while the more liquid S&P SL20 index trended downwards throughout the session. 
Asia said excluding NIFL’s contribution, the ASPI declined eight points during the session. 
It said foreign activity in JKH through block trades lifted activity to remain at moderate levels.

Foreigners recorded a net outflow of Rs. 12.5 million while their participation increased to 42.6% of turnover (previous day 17%). Estimated net foreign buying topped in HNB.N at Rs. 7.7 million and net foreign selling topped in JKH at Rs. 12.3 million. 
NDB Securities said the ASPI closed in green as a result of price gains in counters such as LOLC Development Finance, Kotmale Holdings and Commercial Leasing and Finance.

People’s Bank Chairman Sujeewa Rajapakse 


 





People’s Bank CEO and General Manager Ranjith Kodituwakku 

 




People’s Bank celebrated its 60th anniversary on 1 July 2021 marking a period during which it revolutionised the Sri Lankan banking industry by taking innovative banking to touch the lives of even the most grassroot level customers who had been largely overlooked by the industry.
During the past 60 years, the bank has always strived to understand its customers’ needs and was able to use new technology and innovative products to meet those needs. It is this approach that has won it Sri Lanka’s largest customer base of over 14 million.
People’s Bank was established under Act No. 29 of 1961 with the aim of uplifting the corporate business and rural banking systems. This Act was submitted to Parliament by then Minister of Trade, Food, Co-operatives and Shipping T.B. Illangaratne, during the regime of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Vincent Subasinghe was the first Chairman of People’s Bank; he was a pioneer in providing banking services to the corporate sector.
In an era when banking services were limited to the English-speaking upper-end of the society, it was the establishment of People’s Bank that changed that phenomenon, by starting to work in Sinhala and Tamil. 
Right from the inception, the bank started working towards its mission to serve the masses. Accordingly, People’s Bank has introduced many firsts to the country such as agriculture loans, pawning, SME loans, women’s savings accounts and children’s savings accounts to name a few. Most of these product concepts were so widely embraced by the society, that almost all the local commercial banks are now offering them under different brand names.
Currently, People’s Bank is one of Sri Lanka’s largest financial institutions, boasting over Rs. 2.3 trillion in assets. Its network of 741 branches/service centres is the country’s largest. The bank also possesses a network of over 250 Self Banking Units operating 24/7 all 365 days of the year. This enormous network has enabled the people to get their banking done safely, securely and with ease of accessibility. 
Speaking at a 60th anniversary celebratory event, People’s Bank Chairman Sujeewa Rajapakse stated, “Marking a turning point in the Sri Lankan banking sector, People’s Bank was established on 1 July 1961. Today, we celebrate the 60th anniversary with much pride. As a reputed state bank, People’s Bank not only provides state-of-the-art financial facilities but also renders their services to uplift the social economy. As a state bank, People’s Bank’s objectives transcend beyond mere profits and the main focus has always been the country’s development. 
“Hence many a time we have provided financial facilities for exports, education, health, expressways and tourism infrastructure. People’s Bank has always come forward to shoulder the societal responsibilities and even the current COVID-19 pandemic is no different. We are very much a part of this nation and this is why the country in turn considers us as the pride of the nation.”
People’s Bank Chief Executive Officer and General Manager Ranjith Kodituwakku also commented, “From the inception, People’s Bank was open to the common man instead of just one strata of the society. Although the bank was catering the mass market, that did not prevent it from being innovative and technology-oriented. This is why People’s Bank expanded rapidly in terms of network, financial performance, product portfolio and brand value. 
“Furthermore, People’s Bank has greatly supported the country’s socio-economic development. People’s Bank continues to introduce new banking technology to the financial sector and to its customers in order to establish stronger relationships with them. We look to pioneer modern banking solutions in the future as well.” 
While the bank initially focused on rural sectors and cooperative movements, since then the bank has evolved and is currently offering a range of products to support their customers’ standards of living. The loan schemes on offer include, personal loans, housing loans, professional loans, educational loans and vehicle loans. Furthermore, People’s Bank from time to time has introduced special loan schemes to assist farming and fishing communities, especially to revive the country’s economy after challenging times.
Adapting to the modern world, the People’s Bank launched a digital banking project in 2015, to ensure that its customers could transact easily, safely and efficiently. People’s Bank was the first bank in the island that took steps to undertake a comprehensive digital transformation project covering major part of its operations. As a result, People’s Bank now provides a world-class digital banking experience to all its customers.
For example, People’s Bank has enabled customers to open an account paperless in as short a time as 10 minutes. As another key component of the digitisation journey, People’s Bank introduced People’s Wave mobile banking app for customers to transact any time of the day using their mobile phone without having to go to a bank branch and this has become the most downloaded app in Sri Lanka. Also, People’s Wiz Loan Originating System has enabled the bank to grant personal loans within 24 hours.
In addition, a mobile app was specially introduced to institutional customers called People’s Wyn. Online banking facilities targeting both retail and corporate customers were introduced in 2018. 
In recognition of the unparallel contribution made by People’s Bank towards betterment of the country, banking industry and customers, it has been recognised with many an award both locally and internationally over last several years. Recently the bank won multiple awards from leading institutes such as The Asian Banker magazine (Sri Lanka’s Best Retail Bank and Sri Lanka’s Best Digital Bank in 2021) and Asia Money magazine (Best Domestic Bank and Best Digital Bank in Sri Lanka in 2020). Additionally, The Banker Magazine named People’s Bank as one of the top 1000 banks.

Income grows to Rs. 9.46 b, net interest income 4.26 b








Executive Director Dhammika Perera


 





Managing Director Jayantha S.B. Rangamuwa 




Vallibel Finance PLC yet again demonstrated its time-tested resilience and industry leadership status by achieving impressive results in all its KPIs across fixed deposits, lending portfolio and profitability, while recording positive growth as compared to the negative growth recorded by the overall financial services industry in the 2020/21 financial year. 
The company recorded a Profit before Tax of Rs. 2.3 billion which was an increase of 28.3% and its Profit after Tax soared to Rs. 1.7 billion from Rs. 1.2 billion in the previous year, supported by an aggressive strategy to optimise costs, focus on collections and seek new business avenues, all the while supporting customers to tide over the crisis.
The strong management expertise in the company is evidenced in Non-Performing Loans (NPL) ratio improved to 4.48% from 5.01% in the previous year despite a rash of defaulted payments against industry average rate of 13.9%.
This positive result for the company reflects the recovery and collection drive embarked upon during the year despite the challenging impact on many customers linked to sectors such as tourism, vehicle imports, etc., which were badly affected during the year.
The company grew its Gross Loan Portfolio to Rs. 50 billion in the period under review, from Rs. 42 billion in the previous year, reflecting a growth of 19.0% as a result of the company’s aggressive growth strategy. Vallibel Finance served customers mindfully during this difficult period, helping to rehabilitate them by extending loans as per the Government-stipulated moratorium and even going beyond these norms to grant concessions to customers engaged in industries which were hit particularly hard.
Pre-tax Profits for the year under review achieved a notable all-time high of Rs. 2.8 billion, expanding by 17.1% from the figure of Rs. 2.4 billion in the previous year, which is a testimonial to the company’s prudent management and wealth of experience in the financial services industry, in particular, managing in the face of adversity.
The public confidence in the company was evident in the success achieved in deposit mobilisation during the year. Deposits soared to Rs. 32 billion, a commendable growth by 10% from Rs. 29 billion in the previous year. Total Assets increased to Rs. 55 billion, expanding by 7.4% from the previous figure of Rs. 51 billion.
“We are proud of the financial performance that Vallibel Finance has delivered despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, which resulted in an economic slowdown, while the vehicle import ban impacted the financial services industry. Powering positive growth across all parameters is a fitting achievement that has been brought about by a dedicated and professional team. The entire team at Vallibel Finance has shown exceptional commitment to achieving set targets,” said Vallibel Finance Managing Director Jayantha Rangamuwa.
Generating wealth for shareholders, the company’s Earnings per Share increased to Rs. 29.36 from Rs. 21.29 in the previous year. 
Commenting further, Vallibel Group Chairman Dhammika Perera said, “Year after year, despite severely challenging operational environments and a global pandemic, Vallibel Finance continues to deliver unfailingly on its commitment to safeguard and create wealth and prosperity for all its stakeholders and shareholders, while making a valuable contribution to the Vallibel Group as the flagship company of the highly diversified conglomerate.”
Notably, Vallibel has been twice honoured during the year by two prestigious awards as the ‘Best Finance Company 2021’ by Global Economics and Global Banking and Finance for its performance, thereby certifying its status as a strong and respected industry name.

People’s Merchant Finance Chairman Chandula Abeywickrema


 





People’s Merchant Finance CEO Nalin Wijekoon




People’s Merchant Finance PLC (PMF) has achieved its most significant milestone along the transformation journey of success which commenced in June 2019. 
The company concluded the financial year 2020/21 by crossing several thresholds and tops its successes by earning a profit before taxation of Rs. 100 million during the period. This financial triumph is attributed to the company’s focused strategic plans which have revitalised business operations despite the prevailing economic and industry challenges. 
PMF is well on its way to fulfilling its mission to serving the financial needs of small and medium-sized businesses and individuals across the nation while emerging as a leading player in the financial industry landscape.
 
Strategically planning for a rightful position 
PMF’s transformational journey to renew, revitalise, and reposition the Company to engage on a level playing field with today’s consumers and industry competitors began in mid-2019 with the development of the cohesive five-year strategic plan.
The capital infusion by Sterling Capital Investments Ltd. (SCIL), PMF’s majority shareholder together with the appointment of a Board of Directors with significant banking and finance industry expertise and a dynamic management team to lead key business function enabled the company to focus on its next phase of business growth. 
A rights issue concluded in March 2021 to satisfy the core capital requirements of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) also improved PMF’s governance and compliance frameworks and strengthened the company’s internal funds position. These measures have been pursued to increase the company’s sustainable market position and improve its bottom-line while safeguarding the interests of all our stakeholders.
 
The journey with a visionary destination 
Currently, the company is engaged in renewing and diversifying its product portfolio to cater to market trends and consumer needs. This has resulted in PMF identifying a new target market, those who thrive on building domestic businesses to develop local industries and the national economy. 
A firm product development strategy for the financial year 2021/22 is to launch the Entrepreneurial Loan Scheme to support Sri Lanka’s small and medium-sized entrepreneurs with a vision to succeed and grow in the future.  
 
Adapting to harness opportunities in trying operating conditions 
PMF’s journey was not without challenges. The new leadership and the company faced both internal and external challenges and uncertainties. The company’s internal challenges were strategically managed, prudently overcome, and carefully streamlined.
However, the external challenges, stemming mainly from the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, were unpredictable and unprecedented. The sudden halt in economic activity, inaccessibility in reaching customers, and regulatory changes among other developments impacted the company’s business operations. An even more critical setback for a company whose leasing portfolio consisted of nearly an 80% vehicle leasing component, was the Government’s restriction on the importation of vehicles. However, the visionary leadership together with the dynamic management team came together to circumvent these challenges and harness new opportunities for growth and prosperity.  
Thus, the company’s transformational journey bore fruit. And as inundated with challenges as it was, PMF converted from a loss-making entity to a profitable licenced finance company.
 
A pragmatic leadership approach to facilitate turnaround initiatives 
PMF’s leadership remains confident of the company’s planned future path. They credit the dedicated efforts of PMF’s team with clear guidance from the Board and management leadership to have played a large part in the company’s improved business operations. 
The focused efforts to improve customer care and offer personalised customer services have also instilled the much-needed trust from customers who remained with the company amidst the many trials and tribulations over the past year. The strong partnerships and collaboration with other stakeholders are also credited to have played a critical role in achieving the success of the company to date. 
PMF’s Chairman Chandula Abeywickrema attributed the company’s s success to the strong backing from SCIL, the progressive approach of the Board of Directors in implementing transformational stratagems, and the determination to succeed by the CEO and his management team. 
Abeywickrema, a veteran banker with over 35 years of experience in retail and development banking and well-versed in financial inclusion, confidently said: “The journey we began in mid-2019 has progressed according to plan with the intended turnaround in the company’s performance aligned to the five-year strategy roadmap. We brought about many changes to the management team and internal processes and faced unexpected challenges with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the visionary leadership remained focused on implementing our strategic plan and the entire PMF team worked tirelessly on its implementation. Thus, the pace of our transforming journey to date has been exceptional. The results we have achieved in this financial year, the first full year of operations, showcases the inherent potential which has infused into the company’s processes and systems.”
 
A year of financial and operational success!
Historically, PMF’s financial performance has been average, and the Company has been in a loss-making slump for the past eight years. However, the financial year ended 31 March 2021 has proved to be a focal point showcasing the potential of PMF and the success achieved by the company’s newly-implemented five-year transformational strategies.  The company’s leadership is elated to have broken an 8-year loss-making streak in a financial year inundated with challenges which abounded across countries, economies, and people due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
PMF CFO Nalin Wijekoon said: “The numbers speak for themselves. The turnaround to profitability after eight years, admits the pandemic-related challenges which caused a massive setback to the rural economy of Sri Lanka and the SME sector is remarkable. We were able to provide innovative financial solutions and diversify our product portfolio by utilising our branch network efficiently to meet the evolving consumer demands. The rapid growth story and consistent profitability over the past three quarters reflect only the start of a long journey of value creation to all our key stakeholders driven by focused leadership”. 
 
Following a social transformative path to become a leading industry beacon
While following their planned path to success, PMF has also developed a digital vision considering the importance of technology to reach tech-savvy customers and the need to digitalise and operate the business in an online world.
Hence, while the company currently has only 11 branches and one gold loan Centre, newer branch openings will be limited to five in strategic locations across Sri Lanka and become operational in the next few years. The company is more focused on expanding its digital footprint and taking forward the business on a diversified platform to cater to a range of industries and emerging customer segments. 
The five-year strategic plan will enable the company to meet and achieve its goals in the coming years on a sustainable footing. PMF will continue to enhance its governance and risk management frameworks and proactively meet regulatory requirements as mandated by the CBSL. 
The focus in the coming few years will be to meet the economic and financial needs of Sri Lanka while simultaneously exploring opportunities to expand market presence regionally to become a regionally focused financial institution to enrich the lives of more people more often in more places by providing financial services whenever and wherever they are needed.
The achievements to date are only the beginning. PMF has ambitious plans to achieve its long terms goals. The company is confident that they will be able to continue to achieve similar successes as they navigate the path of their transformational roadmap in the coming four years.
Beyond that, the opportunities are far-reaching and PMF believes that they are just on the tip of the iceberg with this new journey with much more to be achieved as the company continues to evolve with the changing paradigms of the operating environment.

Also, to be discussed is, the local market maturity and arising opportunities, the challenges and regulatory reforms required within the FinTech landscape in Sri Lanka. The participants of the webinar will be able to understand ways to harness the growing breadth of innovation across financial services technology (FinTech) landscape to help improve value and experience to all stakeholders.
EY Consulting Leader for Sri Lanka and Maldives Arjuna Herath commenting on the event stated, “In Asia-Pacific, as with the rest of the world, adoption rates of FinTech have grown even faster than anticipated, surging to 63% in 2019 as tracked by the EY’s Global FinTech Adoption Index. This is expected to drive many more changes in the Asian financial services landscape facilitated by rapid advances in technology, loosening regulations, and competition among FinTech companies and large players. The word ‘bank’ is now more a verb than a noun in this era and slower-moving markets as ours must see the benefit of doing things a new way and catch up.”

In keeping with its continued commitment to enhance technology enabled banking conveniences for the ease of its customers, Union Bank recently introduced Missed Call Banking service as an inclusive, wide-ranging mobile-based banking facility that can be accessed with any type of mobile phone. 
Union Bank’s Missed Call Banking is a Short Message Service (SMS)-based notification service that provides account holders with an instant and secure means of obtaining their account balances on their mobile phone. 
To avail the service, account holders must subscribe to Union Bank’s SMS Alerts feature which can be activated at the time of opening an account or by simply submitting an application form for the said service. Consequently, users can obtain the available balance and a number of other updates on their active banking accounts via SMS. Account holders can give a ‘missed call’ to 0115 800 700 or send an SMS with a given code and in return receive an SMS notification with the requested account information. 
The Missed Call and SMS Banking feature from Union Bank will be especially beneficial at these times of the pandemic, whereby helping the customers to stay safe and reduce their exposure by checking account balances and staying up to date on their account activities from the safety of their homes.

oDoc, Sri Lanka’s largest digital health company, has partnered with Vidal Health, India’s leading TPA with a growing presence in international markets, to enable insurance companies to outsource their entire insurance administration process.
Third Party Administration (TPA) supports insurance companies in their operational services of policyholder enrolment, benefits management, cashless hospitalisation, claims processing and fraud prevention. 
“We believe that providing world-class TPA services will enable insurance companies in Sri Lanka to reduce overheads, ensure negotiated and time-bound rates with hospitals and reduce fraud whilst gaining the ability to focus on their core operations. Policyholders will benefit by getting a superior customer experience in terms of easier access to information (through an app and 24/7 call centre), shorter wait times at hospital discharge and industry-leading customer service levels. In mature and dynamic markets, all insurance companies outsource these services to TPAs; hence it’s only a matter of time for Sri Lanka. We believe this will increase the overall efficiency of the insurance industry in the country,” commented oDoc CEO Heshan Fernando.
The solution will be powered by Vidal Health’s bleeding edge software system, ‘Vings’. The best-in-class system currently manages over 120 million policyholders and combines rule-based auto adjudication with AL/ML-based fraud management, advanced analytics and predictive modelling. Thus, driving significant completive advantages to insurance companies that adopt the platform. 
Elaborating further, Fernando stated, “We are building the digital front door to the healthcare and insurance industry. Having laid the foundation for the healthcare industry, we are now starting on the insurance industry. This TPA layer will enable us to create a seamless customer experience across the healthcare and insurance verticals in Sri Lanka. Thus, bringing us closer to our vision of making high-quality healthcare universally accessible, affordable and personal.”
Vidal Health Group Chairman and Manging Director Girish Rao commented, “We are delighted to partner with oDoc. I am sure, the complementary skills both of us bring to the table will be a game changer and is set to transform the health insurance administration space in Sri Lanka.”

REUTERS: Most emerging market currencies firmed against the dollar on Wednesday, on track to record gains for June and the second quarter, with traders eyeing US jobs data due later this week for clues on economic recovery and the Federal Reserve’s stance.
Turkey’s lira added 0.6% and South Africa’s rand climbed 0.4%. The rand was set to post its first monthly fall in five, down 4% in June so far to be one of the worst EM performers this month.
Private-sector credit in South Africa contracted 0.42% year on year in May from a contraction of 1.76% in April, central bank data showed on Wednesday.
MSCI’s index of EM currencies was set for the weakest month since March, but the strongest second-quarter since 2014.
EM currencies are better placed to handle possible rate hikes and any tapering by the Fed, compared with the crisis in 2013, Commerzbank analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said, as many countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey have already started raising local interest rates this year.
“But that does not mean that the currencies are out of the woods yet. A majority of them may be in a better position fundamentally... but we urge caution as the improvement is likely to be largely due to weaker demand as a result of the pandemic.”
Belarusian bonds were flat after the United States on Tuesday banned ticket sales for air travel to and from Belarus, after Minsk forced a Ryanair flight to land and arrested a dissident journalist aboard. Belarus and its President Alexander Lukashenko have faced heavy criticism over the incident, prompting sanctions from the European Union.
The Belarusian rouble was up 0.3% against the dollar, set for its best quarter since the same time last year.
Looking ahead for emerging markets, several of which look to revenue from tourism, the picture looked bleak with a United Nations study on Wednesday showing that international tourism arrivals are set to stagnate this year, causing up to $2.4 trillion in losses.
The sector is not expected to rebound fully until 2023, the study said.
Among equities, an index of EM stocks fell as a strong handover from Wall Street faded as investors looked toward US jobs data on Friday. The index was on course to mark its fifth straight quarter of gains, up more than 4%.
But the gains were a far cry from 17.3% in the same period last year when shares rallied on hopes of reopening gains after a pandemic-driven steep fall in March.

Commenting on the advances made by Union Assurance, Chief Executive Officer Jude Gomes stated, “We are disrupting life insurance as we know it by eliminating legacy systems, paperwork, and physical interventions to simplify the process of buying protection.

In our customer-centric journey, the first thing we wanted to address is the need of the hour – providing a paperless solution that can be purchased from anywhere in Sri Lanka. We are happy to be the first in industry to offer customers this simple and effective solution.”
While the pandemic continues to surge through many parts of Sri Lanka accompanied by uncertainty, protection is one of the best ways to prepare and provide for the future of loved ones. With affordability at its core, the product pricing starts at Rs. 23 per day and offers Rs. 2 million in the event of a demise, Rs. 3 million in the event of death due to COVID-19, and Rs. 4 million in the event of an accidental death.
Union Assurance is a part of the John Keells Group, Sri Lanka’s largest listed conglomerate. It is among the most awarded insurance companies in Sri Lanka, completing over three decades of success with a market capitalisation of Rs. 18.2 billion, a Life Fund of Rs. 45.0 billion and a Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 315% as at May 2021. Set to empower the Sri Lankan Dream, Union Assurance offers Life Insurance solutions that cover education, health, investment, protection, and retirement needs of Sri Lankans.

First Sri Lankan bank in prestigious ranking and only local bank in it for 11 years in a row


The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has once again been named among the global giants in banking, becoming the only Sri Lankan bank to be ranked in the ‘Top 1000 World Banks’ announced annually by ‘The Banker’ magazine of the UK, for the 11th consecutive year in 2021.
The headwinds of the global COVID-19 pandemic notwithstanding, the country’s benchmark private bank said it has reaffirmed its consistency by becoming the Sri Lankan bank to remain for the longest period on this authoritative global ranking published for the 51st year, demonstrating its indomitable spirit and inherent financial strength.
The Banker, published by the Financial Times of the UK, ranks banks primarily on the basis of their Tier I capital.
“This is truly an affirmation befitting the financial strength and professionalism of the Bank, as well as the sacrifices made in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Commercial Bank Managing Director S. Renganathan observed. “Becoming the first Sri Lankan bank to enter the Top 1000 World Banks ranking was a milestone achievement in itself, but to remain in this ranking for 11 consecutive years despite local and global challenges is a remarkable feat in consistency even in the global context. This is a tribute to the tireless work of the entire Commercial Bank team and provides further motivation to keep serving all stakeholders to the best of our ability.”
Commenting on the 2021 rankings, The Banker noted: “The Covid-19 pandemic has impeded even the most resilient of economies over the past year, with the global economy shrinking by 3.5% in 2020 and world trade volume contracting by 8.6%, according to the World Bank. Banks have faced other headwinds during this period, including persistently low interest rates in most countries, as well as surging competition from fintech and big tech alike.”
“How well has the global banking industry navigated its way through such unprecedented times? Where are their strengths and weaknesses? Is their profitability up or down? Have they seen an uptick in defaulting loans? Which bank has stronger fundamentals compared to its peers? This is what The Banker’s Top 1000 World Banks ranking is able to identify, based on more than 120 data points tracked in The Banker Database year on year. We analyse results by region, country and benchmark bank to bank, as well as run our best-performing bank methodology to pinpoint the leaders that stand heads above the rest,” the magazine said.
The Banker ranks banks from 1 to 1,000, primarily on tier-one capital, and the regional breakdown is supported with editorial commentary, making the Top 1000 World Banks one of the most industry-recognised rankings available. The model refers to 30 key ratios to score and rank banks, country by country, on their performance in eight categories: Growth, Operational efficiency, Return on risk, Soundness, Profitability, Asset quality, Liquidity and Leverage. Each bank’s performance across these categories is then used to generate an overall ‘best-performing bank’ score and ranking.
Ranked Sri Lanka’s Strongest Bank Brand in 2021 by Brand Finance, Commercial Bank of Ceylon ended 2020 with total assets of Rs 1.763 trillion, gross income of Rs 151.966 billion, net profit of Rs 16.373 billion, a deposits base of Rs 1.287 trillion and a loan book of Rs 961.859 billion. 
In terms of Capital Adequacy Ratios, the Bank’s Tier I CAR stood at 13.217% as at 31st December 2020, well above the revised minimum requirement of 9%, while its Total Capital Ratio of 16.819% was also comfortably above the revised requirement of 13%.
Compiled from a database of over 5,000 of the world’s biggest banks and acknowledged by the global financial community as the definitive guide to bank rankings and analysis, The Top 1000 World Banks ranking was begun in 1970, and provides in-depth global banking data and analysis for banks, consultants, regulators, vendors, corporates and investors.
Sri Lanka’s first wholly carbon neutral bank, Commercial Bank is the largest private sector commercial bank, and the third largest bank overall in in the country in terms of total assets. It is the only private sector bank that has been designated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as a higher-tier Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB). Commercial Bank operates a network of 268 branches and 932 automated machines in Sri Lanka. The bank’s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets; Myanmar, where it has a microfinance company in Nay Pyi Taw; and the Maldives, where the bank has a fully-fledged Tier I bank with a majority stake.

CBSL Governor Prof. W.D. Lakshman’s statement on 28 June was long overdue but timely

 




The Central Bank (CB) on Monday according to Daily FT made a public plea to avoid unnecessary speculation over the country’s foreign reserves or debt servicing commitments, saying both issues were being satisfactorily addressed by the Government. 
The sudden rise to this speculation was largely due to the fact that so far only around 35% of a $ 100 million auction of bonds for settlement on 30 June has been sold. In addition to this, also due to the speculation about LC settlements, Sri Lanka has to settle $ 180 million in maturing Sri Lanka Development Bonds. It is likely the CBSL will manage the 30 June settlement. 
Veteran economist now CBSL Governor Prof. Lakshman went public (CBSL Release 28 June) to say: “I wish to assure the media, the general public, the business community and the investor community that the conditions of foreign currency liquidity observed in the domestic market at present are temporary and are driven by excessive speculative activity.”
He further stated: “We request these operators in the market to remain calm and not fuel undue speculation, which is not in the national interest, as the careful management of the situation without undue disruption, will result in a beneficial outcome to the country as a whole.”
A long overdue statement by the Governor, but timely.

Debt stock management 
The country’s crisis position in foreign currency liquidity in the domestic market is largely due to the massive drop in tourism related income of around $ 4.5 billion both direct and indirect. The government therefore needs to make sensible and objective decisions in the next 24 months to bridge this deficit. Some measures have been proactive and have worked. For example, the restrictions in car imports, etc. 
However, to come out of this crisis, we must grow our exports and services and export more workers. Now to export we need raw materials and skills. If banks are going to play hide and seek with LCs and not honour DP terms in a timely manner this will not happen; many of the MNCs will do offshoring with their payments, starving the Government of much-needed foreign exchange.
 
Key questions 
What is the six-month foreign exchange earnings and payments forecast? Are the banks and Government aware of the shortfall? What is the borrowing ability and appetite of commercial banks? Has CBSL studied the balance sheets of banks? Also what are the IMF standby arrangements? 
This is not the time for knee-jerk reactions from the Government, instead the Government should give confidence to the foreign exchange markets by managing the crisis with professionalism and certainly and communicating regularly with the private sector. 

Way forward 
Due to the drop in Government tax revenue the Central Bank has been printing a large stock of rupees to buy LKR bonds, resulting in foreign exchange shortages and driving up domestic six months and one year yields gradually up to 10% in the interbank market. Something the Government must manage going forward given the Government’s huge local borrowings. 
Also given that tourism sector borrowings are firmly tied up in moratoriums and the industry not very likely to return to 2018 levels until early 2023, the Government for a start must address the tourism sector debt crisis before it is too late and sinks some of the banks. There are many solutions proposed by the tourism industry that will work. 
The current foreign exchange situation cannot be managed by issuing a statement of comfort, instead those who are managing the economy should study how Iceland, Ireland, Greece and Latin American countries got out of their foreign currency crises by adopting sensible policies and proper restructuring of debt without taking postures of arrogance. 
Also they must stop playing football with the IMF and the West. Political power in a democracy to democratically-elected leaders is not carte blanche to do as they want. Sensible policies and sound economic management will certainly get us out of this FX crisis.

The Colombo stock market began a new week on a mixed note amidst weak investor interest and sharp gains by illiquid stocks boosting the benchmark index.
The All Share Index gained by 68 points or 0.88%, whilst S&P SL20 shed five points or 0.16%. Turnover was Rs. 1.56 billion involving 50.8 million shares. 
First Capital said the bourse continued to see strength as the ASPI remained in the green zone for the second consecutive day while hovering an index high of 19-weeks due to the “pump of illiquid shares.”
“Stocks ramped up within the first 45 minutes of trading, reaching as high as 7,903, reflecting noteworthy market participation with a surge in illiquid shares. However, the bourse gave up some of its early gains in a mid-day pull back and displayed a sideways movement, thereafter, finally ending the session at 7,878,” First Capital said. 
It said turnover was driven by gains in the Banks sector followed by the Diversified Financials sector accounting for a joint contribution of 46%. 
Asia Securities said the indices showcased mixed performance during the session with the ASPI continuing its positive momentum and closing in green, driven by price gains in index-heavy counters such as NIFL and NEST, while the more liquid S&P SL20 index ended the session marginally lower. Turnover topped in COMB, boosted by block trades while overall activity remained at moderate levels. 
It said Banks, Diversified Financials, Capital Goods and Materials sectors led activity, collectively accounting for 68.9% of turnover. 
Asia said foreigners recorded a net outflow of Rs. 15 million while their participation remained flat at 2.2% of turnover (previous day 5.5%). Estimated net foreign buying topped in HNB.N at Rs. 12.9 million and net foreign selling topped in PLC.N at Rs. 19.5 million. 
NDB Securities said the ASPI closed in green as a result of price gains in counters such as LOLC Development Finance, Nestle Lanka and LOLC Holdings.
It said high net worth and institutional investor participation was noted in Commercial Bank and Cargills. Mixed interest was observed in LOLC Holdings, John Keells Holdings and Colombo Land & Development Company, whilst retail interest was noted in Industrial Asphalts, Browns Investments and SMB Leasing. The Banking sector was the top contributor to the market turnover (due to Commercial Bank), whilst the sector index edged down by 0.12%. The share price of Commercial Bank increased by Rs. 0.20 (0.22%) to close at Rs. 90.10.
The Diversified Financials sector was the second highest contributor to the market turnover (due to LOLC Holdings), whilst the sector index increased by 4.24%. The share price of LOLC Holdings gained Rs. 7 (1.70%) to close at Rs. 418.
John Keells Holdings, Colombo Land & Development Company and Expolanka Holdings were also included amongst the top turnover contributors. The share price of John Keells Holdings moved down by Rs. 0.25 (0.18%) to close at Rs. 138.00. The share price of Colombo Land & Development Company recorded a gain of Rs. 1.70 (6.07%) to close at Rs. 29.70. The share price of Expolanka Holdings declined by Rs. 0.50 (0.98%) to close at Rs. 50.30.

Profit Before Tax up by 34% over previous year to record Rs. 2.67 b 
Profit After Tax soars by 43% to reach Rs. 2.2 b
60,000 moratoriums granted to support customers 
Gross portfolio growth of 15% 
Deposit growth of 32%
NPLs at 6.49% against industry average of over 13.87%
Provision cover of 107% over NPLs







Commercial Leasing & Finance Director/CEO Krishan Thilakaratne

 




In its most impressive performance yet, Commercial Leasing & Finance PLC (CLC) recorded its best-ever financial year despite the severe challenges arising from the COVID-19 global pandemic through the year, achieving a growth of 34% in Profit Before Tax over the previous year to record Rs. 2.67 billion, while Profit After Tax rose by as much as 43% over the preceding year to reach Rs. 2.2 billion. 
Meanwhile, Cost of funds decreased by as much as 23% to record Rs. 4,737 million in the year under review. The key factor for CLC’s success was its two-pronged strategy to navigate the unprecedented year: strengthening customer relationships and helping customers to plan their financial commitments as reflected in the 60,000 moratoriums granted by the Company, which accounts for approximately one-third of its loan portfolio in 2020/21. The Company’s support and guidance was highly appreciated by customers who responded positively by servicing their commitments thereafter in a timely manner.
Deposits grew by 32% during the year under review. CLC remained mindful of the fact that that it needed to partner SMEs and micro business customers especially in times of such crises. In contrast, with the downturn in the Non-Banking Finance Industry (NBFI), CLC recorded a gross portfolio growth of 15%. 
Another impressive achievement by the Company during 2020/21 is the Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio of 6.49% which is less than half of the industry average, thus reflecting the healthy portfolio of the company. Despite the strong portfolio, CLC has 107% provision cover over the NPL portfolio which is almost 100% asset backed. This reflects not only the Company’s financial stability but also its potential to sustain such a performance in the future as well.
Strengthening its footprint further, CLC is on a rapid expansion drive and currently offers the largest variety of products by any NBFI, namely, vehicle leasing and loans, SME finance, microfinance, alternate finance, gold loans, working capital finance through factoring and a variety of deposit products. The product portfolio will be enhanced in the immediate future with the inclusion of credit cards. The success of CLC will be further extended through enhancement of its channel network – with 10 more branches scheduled to be inaugurated in the next financial year. 
CLC is also launching enhanced digital banking operations through the introduction of payment platforms such as iPay, increasing its online and mobile penetration and supporting customers to migrate to digital platforms. CLC will leverage on the iPay platform to partner new merchant networks whilst offering customers exciting products and benefits. 
Commenting on the Company’s stellar performance, CLC Executive Director/CEO Krishan Thilakaratne said:, “Delivering the highest profitability amidst one of the most disruptive years in the nation’s history is a testimonial to the people and processes at CLC. More importantly, this milestone was gained while supporting customers whose businesses were badly affected by the pandemic through which we earned the trust of our customer base. The confidence placed in CLC by the regulator is also at its highest as the Company achieved a capital base of Rs. 21 billion, which amounts to a capital adequacy ratio of 19.44% as against the minimum regulatory ratio of 6.5%. What excites us the most is the fact that we achieved growth in profits in a sustainable manner.”
Through its outstanding performances in 2020/21, CLC has become one of the key contributors to the LOLC Group’s excellent financial performance in the year under consideration while strengthening its identity as one of the leading NBFIs in Sri Lanka. 
Consistently recognised and rewarded by the industry, CLC has been ranked in the top 50 brands by the LMD Brands Annual and listed as one of the top Most Respected Companies in Sri Lanka. During the year, CLC was reaffirmed as SL (A) stable by ICRA Lanka Ltd.

LONDON (Reuters): A global securities watchdog plans to publish its first regulatory guidance for raters of corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance in July to stem growing concern among asset managers about overstated green credentials.
The concern over so-called greenwashing has grown as more investments are channelled into climate-friendly funds, giving rise to a burgeoning market for ratings on how different companies deal with ESG challenges.
Ashley Alder, chair of the IOSCO body that groups securities regulators from the United States, Europe and Asia says that many countries have no rules for ESG raters.
“Many on the buy and sell side have signalled very clearly how confusing the multiplicity of different ESG ratings choices can be, again raising serious questions about relevance, about reliability and about greenwashing,” Alder told City & Financial’s City Week event on Wednesday.
“We are now working on ways to ensure better transparency and clearer definitions. Our work is likely to involve guidance to service providers and ratings agencies, together with recommendations for regulators on how to deal with potential conflicts of interest.” IOSCO expects to publish a report mid-July.
The watchdog also wants asset managers to incorporate more meaningful climate-related considerations into their risk management as the companies in which they invest face more stringent ESG disclosure rules.
“It’s critical for providing quality information to end investors,” Alder said.
IOSCO is working with the IFRS Foundation on setting up a new body by November to write mandatory global standards for company disclosures on climate change.
IOSCO members such as the US and the European Union would continue working on their own disclosure rules, creating some differences, Alder said.
It is essential, therefore, that these domestic approaches become fully interoperable with the global baseline being developed by the IFRS to avoid conflicts and the creation of more “noise” in the system, Alder added.
“We can’t simply work in jurisdictional silos when the climate emergency does not respect national boundaries. Global investors need global comparability,” he said.

Joint report by IFAC and CIPFA forecasts 50% of jurisdictions globally will report on an accrual basis by 2025  


In 2025, governments in 50% of jurisdictions will report on an accrual basis, according to a report released recently by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA). The report was drawn from the International Public Sector Financial Accountability Index, which captures current and future use of public financial reporting bases and frameworks by governments around the world.  The 2021 Index Status Report, which captures information from 165 jurisdictions, finds that while 30% of their governments reported on an accrual basis in 2020 (an increase of 6% since 2018), 50% will report on accrual by the end of 2025. Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean will lead the projected increase in accrual adoption over the coming five years. 
By providing a comprehensive view of government finances, accrual reporting helps ensure that expenditure of public funds is transparent, public officials are held accountable, and future liabilities are recognised officially and planned for properly. With governments under more financial strain than ever following the huge levels of pandemic-related expenditure, understanding the overall picture and making the best use of the remaining resources is crucial to long-term recovery. 
In addition to the support of regional and international organisations, effective implementation of accrual accounting relies on the skills of public sector accountants to interpret the richer, more comprehensive data; as more governments move to accrual, the need for need for public sector accountants will increase correspondingly. 
“Accrual-based accounting is essential in helping governments mitigate corruption, improve trust and transparency, and deliver desired outcomes that their communities deserve and need in the post-pandemic world,” said CIPFA Chief Executive Rob Whiteman. 
Public financial reporting frameworks are developed in various ways, with many using International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). IPSAS provide high quality financial reporting guidance for governments and other public bodies around the world, in order to improve their consistency and transparency. 57% of governments that reported on an accrual basis in 2020 used IPSAS directly, indirectly, or as a reference point. By the end of 2025, nearly three-quarters (73%) of governments that report on accrual will use IPSAS in one of these three ways. 
“This continuing shift from cash to accrual reporting in the public sector, and increased usage of IPSAS in particular, will be crucial to governments globally in making the tough choices they face following the pandemic. Professional accountants have a critical role to play in delivering the full potential benefits for citizens worldwide in terms of decision making, transparency, and accountability,” said IFAC CEO Kevin Dancey. 
IFAC and CIPFA plan to expand the Index progressively in terms of both coverage and information depth and provide periodic status reports throughout this crucial uptake period for accrual financial reporting globally.

You can now apply for your CRIB Report through NDB NEOS as NDB takes another giant step in digitalisation
 

NDB Bank becomes the first player in the banking industry to tie up with the Credit Information Bureau (CRIB) in order to create a hassle-free and convenient method in which the Bank’s customers can register and request for their individual credit reports (iReport) and individual credit score reports (CRIB Score) from wherever they are in Sri Lanka through NDB NEOS.
NDB Director/Group CEO Dimantha Seneviratne said that the Bank is always ready to meet the demands of their customers as and when the need arises. “The pandemic situation has brought about unprecedented changes in the industry and we have strategised in response to these changes well, ensuring continued support to our customers. With this latest partnership, we have taken digital banking to a whole new level, making it easy and convenient for all customers. Earlier, even if you were outstation, you had to come to the CRIB premises to obtain the report or register for the online service. However, NDB has made it 100% convenient for our customers to register and request for their reports via their NEOS mobile app.”
“We have and will continue to flex and reinvest our solutions in response to the customer’s unique needs with our strong digital platform – NDB NEOS,” added Seneviratne, stating, “NDB has taken the lead in the industry with this partnership.”
Accordingly, no paperwork is required to register for obtaining individual credit reports or individual credit score reports via NDB NEOS. Further, no additional verification such as video call or physical verification processes are needed since the customer is already verified. The customer has to simply register once for the CRIB report request service through NDB NEOS following which, the customer can obtain their reports as and when they require. As with all NEOS transactions, this too offers hassle free online payment options through the customer’s NDB accounts. Registration is provided free of charge.
“CRIB continues to expand, simplify and improve on its existing on-line service and product distribution modalities, whilst always ensuring that – you are, who you say you are, before we release your CRIB Report or Score to you. This collaboration and new development, provides yet another simplified option where the individual can simply apply for a Report through the mobile banking application of the relevant CRIB member Institution, which then delivers to CRIB an already validated profile of that Individual. CRIB further validates and registers the individual, before delivering the report direct to that individual, in a secure manner,” CRIB’s Director, General Manager Nandi Anthony said, adding, “Other banking and non-banking member lending institutions of CRIB are also expected to soon follow suit.”
NDB also became the first bank to connect host to host with the Credit Score Instant Decision Module introduced by the Credit Information Bureau (CRIB) through Application Programming Interface earlier in 2020. As part of its digital transformation roadmap, NDB’s NEOS is regularly updated to reflect customer demand for personalisation and ease of use.

DFCC Bank, the premier commercial bank in Sri Lanka, has been at the forefront of enhancing the development of the nation’s dairy sector through innovative microfinancing solutions from specialised Value Chain Financing schemes. The Bank has pioneered lending to further the progress of the dairy industry, allowing farmers in one of Sri Lanka’s key economic sectors to better their livelihoods amidst a strained economy and increasingly difficult financial conditions. 
The objective of such initiatives is to address a significant difficulty faced by many small-scale farmers – the lack of access to adequate long-term financing opportunities. This stands to enhance the development of the dairy sector by empowering the entire value chain, securing long-term growth and stability of the industry. 
Among the many avenues in which DFCC Bank has provided financial and technical support to farmers, a key example is the partnership with Market Oriented Dairy (MOD), funded by the US Department of Agriculture’s ‘Food for Progress’ program. The initiative consisted of the provision of customised lending facilities for dairy farmers and was implemented by the International Executive Service Corps (IESC), who managed the technical support provision to both the dairy farmers, and all staff directly involved in dairy sector-focused lending activities.
Another prime example is a project that involved granting developmental loans to MSMEs within the farmer communities, strengthening their potential to earn, while securing and improving their livelihoods. Implemented in partnership with Chello Dairy Products Ltd., Chello involves the transfer of farmer loan payments directly to a DFCC Bank account in return of the farmers’ supply of milk. 
DFCC in turn ensures access to readily-available financial support enabling them to have a stronger platform for carrying out dairy-farming activities. DFCC Bank has further provided specialised loan conditions to ensure higher accessibility and applicability, including satisfactory pre-agreed risk ratings and reduced processing fees, giving the current difficult socio-economic conditions. 
The project also focuses on inculcating the habit of saving across the farmer community, through a special cash build-up scheme involving the transfer of a small sum to farmer’s accounts, together with the loan instalment directly from the promoter company. 
Commenting on this initiative, Chief Executive Officer Lakshman Silva stated, “We at DFCC place great importance on supporting the growth of the dairy industry, specifically through the empowerment of small dairy farmers who play a significant role in driving it forward. One of the core values of our premier banking is providing robust value propositions, and our many innovative financing solutions, from Value Chan Financing Schemes to partnerships on technical and financial support, showcase our consistent support and the firm priority we’ve assigned to ensuring the prosperity of the sector.”
Through the plethora of innovative financing activities, DFCC Bank has supported over 1,000 (includes loans granted outside this project) dairy farmers with financing support and has provided technical training to a further 300. The Bank is also currently working on two major initiatives, both currently development – showcasing its commitment to continuously drive growth in and develop the dairy industry in Sri Lanka.

Designed to take banking services to customers whose mobility has been limited and to enable them to carry out routine banking transactions in their own neighbourhoods, the ‘Bank-on-Wheels’ units, are currently traversing Colombo and its suburbs and many other areas including towns in the north and east of the country. 
The CRMs they are equipped with can accept deposits, process the notes, and then deploy them for withdrawals. This enables residents in the areas visited by these units to both deposit and withdraw money. Other bank customers also can withdraw cash from these ATMs through LankaPay, Visa, Mastercard and UnionPay networks.
The mobile units visit several locations in a single day and soon, more of them will be deployed in other parts of the country to offer services to a larger segment of the populace, the Bank said. A schedule containing details of the locations to be visited by the mobile banking units and the times, will be announced through the bank’s website as well as on its Facebook and Instagram pages a day in advance, to facilitate awareness.

The reversal of negative global corporate rating actions due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus is continuing as pressure from the pandemic recedes but the pace of stabilisation varies by region and sector, says Fitch Ratings.  
The rating trajectory of 37% of issuers experiencing an Outlook revision or downgrade started to improve, as of 31 May, compared with 24% on 31 March and 9% at YE 2020. 
Ratings and Outlooks for 43% of issuers have yet to improve, 11% were withdrawn and 9% defaulted. Some of the defaulted issuers were re-rated, typically in the ‘CCC’ category, based on their respective pro forma capital structures. 
Fitch is tracking roughly 500 issuers to assess rating reversal patterns. Analysing these trends will lead to a better understanding of how ratings recover from severe and unanticipated shocks to operations. About two-thirds of the reversal starts are tied to scenarios where the issuer’s Rating Outlook was revised to Stable from Negative. The balance is related to upgrade scenarios but only 6% of issuer ratings returned to pre-pandemic levels or higher.  
Of the issuers where pandemic-related rating actions have not started to reverse, 68% have a Negative Outlook or are on Rating Watch Negative, with slightly more than half of these companies also being downgraded. The remaining 32% were downgraded with a Stable Outlook. The mix of rating actions in the cohort of issuers where rating actions started to reverse, or have yet to start a reverse, was relatively stable over the past few months. 
Ratings and Outlooks of 61% of issuers in EMEA have yet to start a reverse, compared with about 40% in North America, APAC and Latin America (LatAm), as of 31 May. The percentage of EMEA issuers that have yet to begin a reverse in March was 75%, while it was 50%-55% elsewhere. The lagging recovery in EMEA is due in part to the rebound in oil prices having a more muted effect, as the oil and gas sector only makes up 8% of the affected ratings and represents 26% of impacted ratings in North America and 23% in LatAm. 
Issuers in sectors acutely affected by the pandemic such as leisure, transportation and aerospace, represent 18% of the issuers in the sample. Of these, only about a quarter started to reverse. Most of the those that have yet to start reversing were downgraded and remain on Negative Outlook. For issuers in sectors Fitch deems as having elevated pandemic related risk, namely the media and real estate sectors, the reversal pace was faster with a third having started to reverse. This is up from almost none in March. Issuers in these sectors represent 9% of its sample. 
Reversals for issuers in sectors designated as having moderate risk, including oil and gas and retail, were already well advanced by March with a third of them starting to reverse by then. This advanced to 38% by 31 May. These issuers represent 26% of the sample.  
Oil and gas accounted for 78% of the issuers in sectors designated as having moderate risk. The sector was especially hard hit early on in the pandemic, representing 32% of the defaults in the sample. Fitch downgraded 24 issuers in the oil and gas sector in March alone last year. However, in 2021 rating momentum is positive for the sector, with upgrades equalling or outpacing downgrades each month.

NDB Securities said the ASPI closed in green as a result of price gains in counters such as LOLC Holdings, LOLC Development Finance and Melstacorp.

NDB Bank recently partnered with the SL@100 platform in order to focus on supporting the mid-market firms during this pandemic situation under the NDB Jayagamu Sri Lanka initiative.
The majority of the Sri Lankan businesses are under the SME segment with 45% of employment being under the same category. Thus, in an effort to uplift this segment, NDB Bank tied up with the SL@100 platform in order to develop Sri Lanka’s SME sector and to provide the non-financial assistance required to develop the sector.
NDB Bank Director/CEO Dimantha Seneviratne said, “Even during one of the greatest health crises of our lifetime, NDB has always been at the forefront of supporting MSMEs. Last year, when we introduced Jayagamu Sri Lanka, it was with the intention of being a pillar of strength to the backbone of our economy – all SMEs. We are looking forward to making this partnership successful in order to further provide our services to this sector.”
Sri Lanka@100 is a private sector-led business development platform that was launched in 2020, to support Sri Lanka’s journey to become a high-income country by 2048, when Sri Lanka will celebrate 100 years of independence. SL@100 will work with mid-market firms and SMEs in optimising internal operations, enhancing product portfolios, accessing new markets, and attracting capital. SL@100 is funded by the US Government’s development arm, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 
“We are excited to partner with NDB, a pioneer in SME-focused banking in the country as we look to unleash the potential of high-growth SMEs. This MOU will match SMEs with the banking products that are a strategic fit to them,” said Sri Lanka@100 Co-founder Dr. Kumudu Gunasekera. 
As the Exclusive Banking Partner, NDB will provide value-added services and financing solutions to companies onboarded to the Sri Lanka@100 platform. In addition, NDB and Sri Lanka@100 will collaborate on hosting capacity building programs and webinars to educate SMEs on financial services and solutions available to them. The partnership will help to expand SL@100 Portfolio companies and contribute to the growth of the SME ecosystem in Sri Lanka.  
“Enterprises, particularly SMEs, play a vital role in raising the standard of living in a country, and their importance in the post-COVID recovery process cannot be overstated. This project helps SMEs navigate the current challenges, become more resilient, and increase profits and employment,” said USAID Mission Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives Reed Aeschliman.
Under the NDB Jayagamu Sri Lanka initiative NDB also partnered with a number of other institutions, including Daraz, Maersk and EDB. The partnership with Daraz came at a time when online delivery and minimum contact was encouraged and enjoyed by the population. This partnership provided SME businesses a method in which to sell their products as a method of relief. 
The Bank also tied up with Maersk as a means to support exporters and to benefit exporters with services and expertise in the shipping sector, in addition to the MoU signed between NDB and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board as a means to support exporters and innovators. Through this, NDB will be linking the Bank’s customers with EDB and directing them to the ‘2000 New Exporter Development Program’ which will then assist customers to develop their capacity, product and market of each business.
The Bank was crowned as Sri Lanka’s Best Bank 2021 by the prestigious Global Finance Magazine of USA, fresh on the heels of being recognised as The Bank of the Year Sri Lanka, by The Banker Magazine UK.

Initiative uses video verification and information from Department of Registration of Persons database to support bank’s sustainability strategy of going paperless

Further reiterating its market position as one of Sri Lanka’s most customer-centric and digitally enabled financial institutions, DFCC Bank has implemented the non-face to face onboarding process based on the guidelines issued by Central Bank and accessing the database of the Department of Registration of Persons to verify customer National Identity Card information. 
The process was implemented in May 2021 and many customers since have been onboarded. This initiative was timely as well with the present outbreak of COVID-19 phase 3 and minimises the risk of spread or contagion since customers can onboard from the safety of their home using any device of their choice .
The bank recently-introduced its Non-Face-to-Face (NF2F) digital account opening  process which includes video verification using the ‘DFCC Video Chatz’ video banking service  hosted on the bank’s cutting edge trilingual website. 
Resulting from the recent guidelines issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), DFCC Bank has developed this fully integrated and seamless customer onboarding process which allows customers to open accounts digitally online without having to step into the bank branch anytime from any place. 
The National Identification Card (NIC) data stored in the Department for Registration of Persons (DRP) system is integrated to facilitate this seamless process digitally and offer customers the convenience to open Savings Accounts, Foreign Currency (FCY) Accounts, Fixed Deposit (FD) accounts and Special Deposit Accounts (SDA) virtually. Following this process the applicant will be able to choose a convenient time for a video call with the bank representative for the verification process to take place to fulfill CBSL guidelines on the e-KYC process.
In addition to driving greater customer convenience which enables customers to open accounts in the comfort of their home or office, this initiative also supports one of the banks sustainability strategies of moving towards a paperless and eco-friendly environment.
Sharing his thoughts in relations to NF2F customer onboarding, DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva said: “In an era where digital transformation is something that the banking industry is now embracing the Non-Face-to-Face (NF2F) facility offers customers the utmost convenience they have never experienced before. As we are at the forefront of technological innovation, our solution will certainly be recognized as a benchmark in the industry. The launch of the NF2F facility further reiterates the banks position of become one of Sri Lanka’s most customer centric and digitally enabled bank. The user-friendly interface means that customers are given the option to open accounts by completing the online form from any device, including smart phones, tablets, and desktop computers. Therefore this platform offered convenience of opening an account at their preferred branch, without ever having to visit the branch in person.”

Standard Chartered Sri Lanka has successfully financed the import of four million COVID-19 vaccine doses for the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation by facilitating a trade loan to the Bank of Ceylon and People’s Bank.
In efforts to expedite the nation’s vaccination program during the latest wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Standard Chartered worked closely with the two leading state-owned banks to facilitate prompt and efficient trade financing solutions to help accelerate the invoice processing and payments to purchase the vaccines. 
“Across the globe, Standard Chartered has been in the forefront to help local communities to fight the Coronavirus pandemic so that the world can look forward to a better tomorrow. When the first wave hit Sri Lanka last year, Standard Chartered made a much-needed donation of $ 500,000 to the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society to support emergency relief activities island-wide. This trade loan is a continuation of the bank’s efforts to help the citizens of Sri Lanka overcome the pandemic and is a testament of Standard Chartered’s ‘here for good’ promise,” said Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Bingumal Thewarathanthri.Commenting on the collaborative efforts in financing the vaccine imports to help control the spread of the virus was Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Executive Director and Head of Financial Institutions Lakshan Goonetilleke. 
“It was very fulfilling for Standard Chartered to have been part of this trade loan, together with Bank of Ceylon and People’s Bank, to help fast-track Sri Lanka’s efforts in expanding the reach of the vaccination. Our strong trade distribution network, consisting of leading market participants, also played a critical role in bringing these vaccines into the country,” he said.
During this unprecedented global challenge, the Standard Chartered Group, in March 2020, initiated a $ 1 billion commitment of non-for-profit financing for companies and to date, has allocated over $ 800 million to enable companies around the world to produce essential equipment that will help in the fight against the pandemic and deliver sustainable finance.
Sri Lanka became the first country in South Asia to complete a drawdown under this financing program, and has since completed drawdowns totalling over $ 45 million. The loans beneficiaries include Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) manufacturers who were able to expand their manufacturing capacity of PPE such as medical and protective gloves and face masks, as well as pandemic-hit apparel and textile manufacturers who made the switch to produce and export essential PPE supplies to countries like the US.

Coming off a successful quarter, recording 282% increase in profit compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous year, SDB bank and its diverse shareholder base are set to enter another period of consistent growth.
The bank’s extended growth phase comes on the back of its long-term SME development efforts which have resulted in loan growth across the sector; its digital transformation initiatives which have improved access to solutions and service delivery; and its support of key segments including female-led enterprises. 
The bank embarked on a two-phased capital raising plan last year to support business growth over the next three to four years with the first phase carried out via the bank’s extremely successful rights issue in FY2020, which led to Rs. 1.5 billion being raised. This Issue had the twin distinctions of being the first-ever digital rights issue by a Colombo Stock Exchange-listed entity plus the first local digital share subscription to be oversubscribed. The bank is now geared to raise further capital via a Second Public Offering (SPO) to facilitate the second phase of its continued growth journey in an effort to create greater value for its shareholders.
SDB bank’s decision to go for an SPO – a capital raising exercise by a company that is already listed on the CSE and involves the sale of new shares to the public through a secondary offering is based on its decision to invite its customers, shareholders and other stakeholders as well as the general public to take part in this journey. This is a result of its extended growth phase and the culmination of its two-phase capital plan plus its commitment to create even more value for its shareholders.
With 68 million new ordinary voting shares to be issued to the public via the SPO at a share price of Rs. 51.50, and 20 million additional shares in case of an oversubscription, the fresh capital raising effort will enable in further reinforcing the bank’s equity base and consequently improve its capital adequacy ratios in adherence with the BASEL III guidelines of the Central Bank. Equally, the funds raised via the SPO will support SDB bank’s expected loan portfolio growth for the period 2021-2022. 
The bank’s Board will reserve the right to offer new shares on preferential basis to identified investors (50.0% of SPO Shares) plus to existing shareholders (37.5% of SPO Shares), in consultation with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). Having received shareholder approval at the recent EGM, the SPO will be subject to shareholding regulations as set out in the Banking Act. 
With current stated capital of SDB bank at Rs. 7.7 billion represented by 91.57 million shares (85.65% publicly-held), the bank’s SME and development banking focus is expected to ensure continuous growth due to its services’ entrepreneurial banking outlook in nationally-critical economic segments.
NDB Investment Bank Ltd., who advised SDB bank on the listing on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 2012 and the successful Rights Issue in 2020 amongst numerous other fundraising transactions is advising the bank as Financial Advisors and Managers to the SPO as well.
SDB bank’s continued support of SMEs including female-run industries positions the bank strategically as an attractive, development-oriented investment option, directly aligned with national economic development. A stance that sees them offering both financial assistance and entrepreneurial consultancy services across the SME sector, which accounts for 52% of national GDP, this is complemented by its active advocacy of women’s empowerment initiatives and female entrepreneurship as well as digitalisation across internal processes and in service delivery to all customers. 
Similarly, the bank’s digital inclusion and financial literacy efforts island-wide have allowed for greater access to modern banking services across both urban and rural parts of the country, taking digital banking solutions to all Sri Lankans and ensuring greater participation in the national economy. 
Its much-awaited SPO represents an opportunity for diverse investors including individuals and holding companies to secure stocks within a well-established banking entity that is fully-aligned with national economic development, and on a continuous growth trajectory.

LONDON (Reuters): World stocks climbed another peak on Monday, while US bond yields were near three-month lows as worries of rising inflation abated and investors anticipated the US Federal Reserve sticking to its dovish course this week.
The MSCI world equity index and Europe’s STOXX 600 index reached record highs, lifted by the prospect of a broadening economic recovery from COVID-19 and anticipation of dovish monetary policy from central banks.
Recovery bets also boosted oil to May 2019 highs.
S&P 500 futures meanwhile nudged 0.1% higher, with investors apparently viewing Thursday’s above-forecast U.S. inflation data and surging factory prices in China as temporary or manageable.
Goldman Sachs economists said concerns that rising inflation will derail the market recovery or lead to sharply higher bond yields were probably misplaced.
“The rally at the moment feels cautiously optimistic. The reality is that I feel it will continue to climb slowly as we continue to see decent data supporting the argument,” John Woolfitt, Director at Atlantic Capital at London, said.
Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasuries stood at 1.4602%, with investors seemingly relaxed about their inflation concerns, which spooked rates in late March.
“It is becoming painful for bond bears and I bet the 10-year yield will fall to 1.25% or even 1%,” said Akira Takei, fund manager at Asset Management One, noting that the U.S. economic recovery is likely to slow in coming months.
Speculators’ net long positions in U.S. bond futures hit the highest level since October 2017, U.S. financial watchdog data showed.
Many investors expect the Fed to repeat its dovish view at its two-day meeting from Tuesday. While some board members have said the central bank should start discussing tapering its bond buying, most investors think a majority still prefer to wait.
Markets in Asia were calmer with China, Hong Kong and Australia closed for a holiday. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.7%, while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2%.
Broader markets largely shrugged off the weekend’s G7 meeting, which scolded China over human rights in its Xinjiang region, called for Hong Kong to keep a high degree of autonomy and demanded a full and thorough investigation of the origins of the coronavirus in China.

CSE Matara Branch Manager Nirodha Abeygunawardena 




The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recently initiated a series of virtual forums for Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) to highlight the advantages of listing on the Empower Board. The initial event, organised by the Matara branch of CSE, drew an encouraging
interest from the business community in Matara.  
SMEs are a key contributor to the Sri Lanka Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The objective of the series is to encourage SMEs to understand the availability of an alternative method to raise capital and to illustrate the opportunities provided by listing on the Empower Board. 
Atarah Capital Partners Ltd. Managing Director Rohan Senewiratne, Chrissworld Ltd. Managing Director Suraj Surwaweera, CSE Matara Branch Manager Nirodha Abeygunawardena, and CSE Listing Department Assistant Manager Kassapa Weerasekara, joined the discussion. The participants also engaged in a broad Question and Answer discussion during the program.
Elaborating on reasons why a business should be listed, Atarah Capital Partners Ltd. Managing Director Rohan Senewiratne added that it was a timely approach for SMEs to list on the Empower Board, as an alternative to traditional methods of capital raising. He eliminated myths and fallacies on listing and explained how the capital market allowed companies to build a stronger investor base and add value to the company.
Chrissworld Ltd. Managing Director Suraj Surwaweera shared the company’s experience in the listing process: “We met Atarah Capital Partners in 2019 with the objective of exploring our options in acquiring capital and growing our business. After evaluating other options, we recognised the stock market as an ideal source of capital for our company and a better alternative to other capital sources such as banks and private placements. It has served us as a less complex and a convenient process. It should be noted that the corporation and guidance that we received from CSE and Atarah Capital Partners throughout the process is commendable.”
He further added, “Listing on CSE provides a direction to maintain your business with more discipline and regulation, which enhances recognition and confidence among stakeholders. The viable source of capital that the stock market provides ensure that businesses do not miss opportunities to grow due to lack of capital. Therefore, the stock market is a great opportunity to raise capital for all Small and Medium Entrepreneurs.”

Sri Lanka’s leading private sector bank HNB PLC disbursed over Rs. 1 billion to entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector through its recently launched micro leasing facility, offering micro, medium and small enterprises (MSMEs) a myriad of benefits and opportunities. 
Working in line with Central Bank (CBSL) directives to support and strengthen Sri Lanka›s agriculture sector, HNB’s micro leases will be utilised to enhance the capabilities of over 400 agricultural entrepreneurs across the island. 
A collaborative effort by the bank’s leasing and microfinance arms, the facility offers customers a full suite of services, including access to great deals and benefits from HNB’s extensive merchant partner network. 
HNB Deputy General Manager - Retail and SME Banking Sanjay Wijemanne said: “The agriculture sector was one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of revenue generation.

The KPMG Academy will enlighten decision makers on ‘Recent Changes in Foreign Exchange Regulations & Tax Impact’ at the Friday Mid-Afternoon Chat on 18 June from 3 p.m. onwards. 
Upon the introduction of the Foreign Exchange Act No. 12 of 2017, foreign exchange rules were significantly relaxed. However, with the recent foreign exchange crisis faced by Sri Lanka, several changes were introduced during the past few months to stabilise the situation. 
Gazette No 2213/34 and 2213/35 dated 3 February introduced certain changes in relation to the applicable foreign exchange regulations on capital transactions to be carried out by residents and non-residents. 
With the introduction of the Foreign Exchange Act in 2017, regulations were issued providing the authorised class or classes of capital transactions in foreign exchange and the procedure applicable on the same. There are several gazettes issued in the recent months to modify certain areas on authorised class or classes of capital transactions including the capital transaction undertaken outside Sri Lanka by a resident person and the capital transaction undertaken in Sri Lanka by a resident outside Sri Lanka, which leads to enhanced clarity on the process to be adopted in carryout the capital transactions.
Additionally, the rules pertaining to the remittance of export proceeds has been changed four times till now during this year. With the new changes to the tax law there seems to be a lacuna in the law in relation to export of service which could lead to export of service being taxed at standard rate although such exporters do contribute to the national economy by attracting foreign exchange. 
The tax clearance certification process for remittance of payments to non-residents is also subject to certain revisions. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue has issued a revised notice to the authorised dealers and persons engaged in outward remittance by elaborating the requirement of tax clearance certificate during the pandemic period.  These are few of the areas lined up for discussion in this interactive session and would also include the temporary restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The session will be conducted by Principal – Tax & Regulatory Suresh Perera, Director – Tax & Regulatory Rifka Ziyard and Senior Manager/Director – Tax & Regulatory Sachithra Chandrasena of KPMG.

Keynote Speaker RBC Global Asset Management Global Equities - Senior Portfolio Manager Benjamin Yeoh, CFA


 





Commercial Bank Chief Risk Officer Kapila Hettihamu


 





MAS Holdings Head of Sustainability Siddharth Amalean


 





Acuity Knowledge Partners Senior Director, Global Head of Investment Research Chanakya Dissanayake




Organised by the CFA Society Sri Lanka, the eighth annual CFA Capital Market Awards, which will be held on 22 June at 6 p.m., promises to be a standout event, with this year’s awards being held virtually – under the theme of ‘Investing with Purpose’ – and
boasting a panel discussion featuring prominent industry leaders. 
‘Investing with Purpose’ highlights the emergence of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as a crucial component of the investment process with investors increasingly incorporating ESG data to garner a more complete understanding of the entities they invest in.
On the back of growing demand from investors, the CFA Society Sri Lanka is leading the way in helping local capital markets industry practitioners understand and integrate ESG in the investment research process. Globally, too, the CFA Institute has been driving the consideration of ESG factors in the research process.
This year’s CFA Capital Market Awards is set to feature RBC Global Asset Management Senior Portfolio Manager of Global Equities Benjamin Yeoh, CFA, as the keynote speaker, who will focus on why ESG matters, particularly in the context of the asset management industry, and the value it provides to investors as well as society at large. 
In his keynote address, Yeoh – who also sits in a non-executive advisory capacity for Responsible Investment and ESG at a leading UK investment trust – will delve into how to identify ESG components and thereby create long-term value. In addition, he will shed light on the CFA Institute’s Certificate in ESG Investing (of which Yeoh is a co-author) and how practitioners can gain a further understanding through the program.
Speaking ahead of the event, Yeoh commented: “I’m delighted to speak to the CFA Society Sri Lanka. The asset management industry has an important purpose in society, not only to help individuals and organisations meet investing and savings needs, but also to contribute to long-term value creation for society. Part of how we do this is by assessing ESG factors that contribute to long-term value, and I look forward to discussing this.”
The keynote address will be followed by a panel discussion featuring Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Chief Risk Officer Kapila Hettihamu, MAS Holdings Head of Sustainability Siddharth Amalean, and moderated by Acuity Knowledge Partners Senior Director and Global Head of Investment Research Chanakya Dissanayake. The panel discussion will focus on the global banks’ progress in adopting ESG best practices vis-à-vis lending operations, as well as how Sri Lanka’s Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) are progressing in terms of domestic financing operations. The panel will discuss unique challenges faced by LCBs in Sri Lanka when adopting global ESG best practices for lending operations, in light of the nation’s small market size and domestic industry composition.
In addition, the panellists will take a deep dive into the initiatives of MAS Holdings, challenges faced in funding investments to improve sustainability, and Sri Lanka’s opportunity to create a niche for itself as a manufacturing destination with superior sustainability standards. 
Hettihamu added: “I look forward to discussing the ongoing adoption of ESG fundamentals in the financial sector, frameworks that Sri Lankan banks are aligned with, underlying regulatory support and the challenges faced in this journey, along with the benefits both to institutions and society at large, to rekindle interest in this important topic.”
Dissanayake, who is moderating this year’s event, noted: “It’s great to be a part of the Capital Market Awards this year. With ESG becoming a key priority for asset managers globally, our panel discussion will focus on the implications for emerging markets such as Sri Lanka with insights from senior leadership of MAS Holdings and Commercial Bank PLC, in how they have integrated ESG into their business models.”
The event is sponsored by the Colombo Stock Exchange (Platinum Sponsor), Acuity Stock Brokers (Silver Sponsor), Capital Alliance (Silver Sponsor), Daily FT and Daily Mirror (Print Media Sponsors).

The regulatory Risk-Based Capital (RBC) ratios of non-life insurers in Sri Lanka will normalise in the medium term with the resumption of dividend pay-outs to shareholders and a likely moderation in earnings, Fitch Ratings said yesterday.
It said Risk Based Capital (RBC) ratios of non-life insurers improved considerably in 2020 due to the low motor and medical insurance claims following pandemic-led lockdowns as well as insurers’ high retention of profits. 
“We estimate the regulatory available capital of Fitch-rated non-life insurers to have increased by 30% in 2020 compared to an increase of 6% in 2019. As a result, the average RBC ratio of rated non-life insurers rose to 278% in 2020 from 221% in 2019 (2018: 211%),” Fitch said. 
It said claims from motor and medical insurance, which collectively accounted for well over 60% of the industry’s premiums and net claims, markedly reduced. Claims ratios of Fitch-rated non-life insurers improved to 49% in 2020 (2019: 66%), supporting underwriting profitability. In addition, a directive in 2020 by the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka for all insurers to suspend dividend distributions contributed to the insurers’ higher profit retention. 
Fitch observes that most insurers have restarted dividend distribution in 2021 upon obtaining regulatory approval, although some insurers continue to cautiously retain a portion of profit to enhance capital buffers to weather any potential earnings volatility from COVID-19-related disruptions. 
Fitch expects earnings to decline in 2021 with claims picking up from unusually low levels in 2020. Motor claims frequency is likely to gradually increase while a potential weakening of the rupee against major currencies may also raise claim costs. 
Fitch believes that a steady growth in non-life insurers’ exposure to medical insurance policies, which typically have higher claims ratios, may also contribute to profit normalisation in the medium term.
“We think the impact on claims ratios from the renewed travel restrictions from May 2021 will be limited unless these restrictions are extended or expanded to control the spread of the coronavirus,” Fitch said. 
“In addition, we believe that investment incomes of most non-life insurers underwriting short-tail liabilities will soften in the near term due to their high exposure to short-term, fixed-income assets that will likely be repriced at a lower yield at maturity due to the low interest rate environment,” Fitch said. 
Growth in new non-life business volumes will also be limited by a reduction in new vehicle registrations as a result of the government curbs on motor-vehicle imports to control currency depreciation. Fitch expects the ban on motor-vehicle imports to continue at least over the near term. 
Fitch also believes the high price competition in the domestic non-life industry will constrain insurers’ ability to pass on higher input costs through price increases to policyholders. However, the insurers’ efforts to digitise distribution and the gradual increase in exposure of some insurers to non-motor lines, such as medical, fire, property and micro insurance classes, should partially offset pressure on non-life business growth.

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has introduced a Corporate Fuel Credit Card and a Prepaid Fuel Card that can exclusively be used for fuel purchases and will eliminate the cumbersome fuel allowance reimbursement process currently followed by most companies.
Designed to benefit large companies as well as small and medium enterprises that reimburse employee fuel bills every month, these cards aim to replace company fuel books and travel voucher books and significantly save time spent on verifying bills, collating and reconciling usage information, and fretting over lost receipts, the Bank said. 
A Prepaid Fuel Card is essentially issued to employees of a company, at the request of a company and is a reloadable card that works like a debit card and can only be used at fuel stations. At the beginning of each month, a company can credit an employee’s monthly fuel allowance in advance to his or her ComBank Prepaid Fuel Card account which can then be used to purchase fuel. Monthly usage is provided to the company by the Bank and the company can top up the card with the required amount to enable the employee to utilise his or her next month’s allowance.
A Corporate Fuel Credit Card is enabled with an automated settlement option where the fuel usage of an employee is automatically debited from the company’s current account when the Card is used by the employee to pump fuel. 
In 2019, Commercial Bank launched prepaid cards that can be topped up with funds online and used for different or specific purposes while allowing their users to better manage their spending habits and enjoy minimal exposure to risk. These cards included a multi-purpose Spend Card that can be used by individuals to provide money for spending to family members, and a Prepaid Web Card for online transactions.
Commercial Bank Credit and Debit Cards offer year-round promotions covering a wide variety of services.

The Colombo stock market yesterday closed on a negative note, extending its struggle despite some key new policy and strategy announcements in the past two days via the ongoing virtually held Sri Lanka Investment Forum. 
After Monday’s dismal 0.3% gain, the two indices yesterday declined by 0.7% raising concerns among investors that the market was losing momentum. Turnover was below average at Rs. 2 billion involving 99 million shares.
First Capital said the bourse stirred up a pessimistic outlook by settling in the red, halting the market from rallying for the fourth straight session while failing to retain the seven-week high index. 
“ASPI took a nose-dived drop posting an intraday low of 7,536 within the first hour of trading and thereafter, recovered over the next 30 minutes and later drifted to a sideways movement throughout the session closing at 7,542 losing 50 points,” First Capital added. 
It said turnover was dominated by the Real Estate sector followed by the Capital Goods sector, accounting for a joint contribution of 54%. 
Asia Securities said following consecutive sessions of price gains, the indices declined during the session as investors realised gains from recent price increases. As the latest addition to the CSE, Prime Lands Residencies commenced trading today and witnessed sharp gains on its debut. The stock contributed 31% to turnover while overall activity remained at healthy levels. 
Asia said Real Estate, Capital Goods, Diversified Financials and Food, Beverage and Tobacco sectors led activity, collectively accounting for 72% of turnover. 
Foreigners recorded a net outflow of Rs. 22.8 million while their participation remained flat at 3% of turnover (previous day 3.1%). Estimated net foreign buying topped in HHL at Rs. 27.1 million and net foreign selling topped in SFIN at Rs. 16 million. 
NDB Securities said the ASPI closed in red as a result of price losses in counters such as LOLC Holdings, Commercial Bank and Browns Investments.
It said high net worth and institutional investor participation remained subdued for the day. Mixed interest was observed in Lanka Walltiles, Royal Ceramics and LOLC Holdings, whilst retail interest was noted in Prime Lands Residencies, Browns Investments and Industrial Asphalts. 
The Real Estate sector was the top contributor to the market turnover (due to Prime Lands Residencies), whilst the sector index lost 0.87%. The share price of Prime Land Residencies increased by Rs. 1.50 (14.42%) to close at Rs. 11.90.
Capital Goods sector was the second highest contributor to the market turnover (due to Royal Ceramics and Lanka Walltiles), whilst the sector index decreased by 0.63%. The share price of Royal Ceramics lost Rs. 0.30 (0.78%) to close at Rs. 38.30. The share price of Lanka Walltiles moved down by Rs. 3.40 (5.11%) to close at Rs. 63.10.

Achieved whilst continuing to drive key sectors forward








Chairman Lakshman Abeysekara


 





CEO Thilak Piyadigama




Maintaining the growth trajectory displayed in 2020 with a phenomenal 279% annual profit rise in comparison to 2019, SDB bank went on to record an equally strong performance in the first quarter of 2021, particularly through steady growth across its diverse loan portfolio. 
The bank continued to meet the challenges of the current economic climate successfully through relentless digital innovation and service delivery transformation, allowing them to register an almost threefold increase in profit for the three months ended 31 March 2021. Equalling Rs. 302 million, this represents a 190% increase in profit from the corresponding quarter last year. For the quarter under review, earnings per share on profit rose to Rs. 3.3 from Rs. 1.9 per share in Q1 2020. 
In the first quarter this year, the bank grew the volume of loans (net) amounting to Rs. 5.5 billion, up 5.2% from the end of 2020. This was reflected in the bank’s fee income as well, closely linked to its loans, up by a considerable 139%. The bank’s asset or loan quality also improved, with a gross non-performing advances ratio of 4.47% for the quarter, a small but significant reduction from 4.54% in 2020.
Parallelly, the bank maintained healthy Tier 1 and total capital adequacy ratios of 9.44% and 12.71% respectively by the end of March 2021, above the regulatory requirements. The bank stated Rs. 9.3 billion in core capital by end-March, having raised Rs. 1.53 billion in their rights issue in November 2020, with another Rs. 4 billion raised in fresh deposits in the period under review, supporting its liquidity further. SDB bank’s liquidity assets ratio stood above the statutory requirement, at 20.7%. 
Most notably, the bank registered net interest income of Rs. 1.63 billion in Q1 2021, a significant 11% rise from the same period in the previous year. Equally, the bank only had to provide Rs. 156.1 million in possible bad loans during this period, representing a drastic drop from Rs. 413.8 million in the same period in 2020. 
SDB bank’s sustained high-performance in Q1 2021 and its loan portfolio growth plus loan quality for the period can be attributed to the bank’s initiatives, involving SME development, a nationally critical sector amounting to 52% of national GDP. Together with reputed organisations such as The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA – Sri Lanka), MILCO, and DIMO, SDB bank has offered both one-on-one expert mentorship and technical knowledge plus specialised loans as well as leasing promotions to develop SMEs island wide. 
Similarly, the bank’s continuous growth trajectory draws from its efforts at women’s empowerment and the extensive support leant to female entrepreneurs. This is reflected both in female workforce participation at SDB bank, possibly the highest in Sri Lanka, as well as its stance of active support to female-led SMEs. Equally, the bank’s standing as a digital pacesetter in local banking has aided its upward growth trend, with digital transformation efforts both in streamlining internal processes as well as in service delivery innovation for its customers.
The bank’s continuous digital inclusion efforts island wide have also allowed for increased digital and financial literacy across both urban and rural parts of the country, offering digital banking solutions to the masses in Sri Lanka. This has allowed for greater participation in the digital economy and improved access to financial services including loans, thereby directly influencing national economic growth.
SDB bank’s stellar performance in Q1 2021 comes on the back of its continuous efforts in offering value to all stakeholders equally, with an emphasis on valuing each individual while transcending mere transactional relationships. Their approach of supporting nationally critical sectors while offering greater value to all customers through digital transformation is geared to propel the growth levels of the bank even further in the remaining quarters of the year.

The Group of Seven (G7) countries’ backing of a global minimum tax of at least 15% highlights widespread interest among major developed market governments in raising taxes for multinational companies, says Fitch Ratings. 
Globalisation, a trend toward digitalisation, US President Joseph Biden’s aversion to digital service taxes on US technology firms and efforts to shore up public finances as the world recovers from the coronavirus pandemic underscore the agreement. Tax rates are not typically a key rating driver for Fitch-rated issuers and near-term cash flow implications are unlikely due to the length of time to enact legislation. 
There is no guarantee a global minimum tax will become legislation in the US or any other OECD country, given the large number of countries where passage would be required and weak bipartisan support for higher taxes in the US. However, the announcement by the largest nations is the first step to a multilateral agreement and a core pillar of Biden’s ‘Made In America’ tax plan, which initially proposed a global minimum tax rate of 21%. 
If passed, the global minimum tax would apply to certain US companies generating significant foreign earnings regardless of whether they have a physical presence in international markets where they conduct business. Many multinationals pay lower taxes than domestic peers due to the blending of income streams from high and low tax countries and other tax advantages. 
Quantifying the potential effect of a global minimum tax on corporate cash flow is not straight forward. However, the aggregate effective tax rate for technology companies was below the proposed global minimum tax of at least 15% at 12% in 2019, according to our analysis of about 875 Fitch-rated US corporates across multiple sectors.
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the US and the EU agreed in principal to implement new international tax rules and remove digital service taxes, per the 5 June G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Communique. 
The group committed to an equitable solution on the allocation of taxing rights, with market countries awarded taxing rights on at least 20% of profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises. G7 Finance Ministers committed to a global minimum tax of at least 15% and agreed on the importance of progressing on these efforts and reaching an agreement at the meeting of G20 Finance Ministers next month.
A global minimum tax would allow countries to increase revenue from large multinationals without the use of digital service taxes. It might also be welcomed by technology companies, given the prospect of replacing a patchwork of disparate taxing rules across countries with a universal set of rules providing greater clarity for business planning. 
Digital tax legislation has already been enacted by 26 countries, including France and the UK, with many others having drafted or announced intentions to implement a digital tax, according to KPMG’s May 2021 developments summary on the taxation of the digitised economy. The US announced but temporarily suspended tariffs on goods from six trading partners subjecting US technology companies to digital service taxes on 2 June, prior to the G7 announcement. If a global minimum tax becomes legislation and individual countries chose to retain a digital service tax, it may be possible that a credit is provided against any future global minimum taxes that might be instituted. Digital service tax rates vary across countries but are generally based on revenues, which may produce a significant difference between any global minimum tax proposal on the profits of large multinational companies in a specific jurisdiction.

Wins ‘Best Retail Bank’ and ‘Best Digital Bank’








Chairman Sujeewa Rajapakse


 





CEO and GM Ranjith Kodituwakku




The Asian Banker Excellence in Retail Financial Services International Awards 2021, one of the world’s most prestigious awards programs has awarded People’s Bank the ‘Best Retail Bank in Sri Lanka’ and ‘Best Digital Bank’ awards in recognition of the giant
strides taken by People’s Bank championing banking excellence in Sri Lanka.
The Excellence in Retail Financial Services Awards program is run on a completely neutral basis and unfunded, over a three-to-four-month period. It involves a team of highly experienced international researchers assessing over 160 financial institutions internationally.
Commenting on this monumental achievement, People’s Bank Chairman Sujeewa Rajapaksa said, “While 2020 was a year like no other due to the COVID-19 pandemic, People’ Bank not only was able to wade through them largely unscathed, but also played a key role in executing the Government’s financial relief programs to support COVID-19 affected individuals and businesses by providing moratoria and concessionary loans. Awards such as these further encourage us to continue to do our utmost for the nation as the country’s most widely embraced bank by the people.”
People’s Bank Chief Executive Officer/General Manager Ranjith Kodituwakku stated, “I couldn’t be prouder of this achievement. Being named ‘Best Retail Bank’ and ‘Best Digital Bank’ by the Asian Banker Excellence in Retail Financial Services International Awards is an ode to the dedication and commitment of all our staff which made it possible for the bank to overcome unprecedented challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic.
People’s Bank which possesses the country’s largest banking customer base of over 14 million also possesses the country’s largest branch network. Not resting on its laurels, the Bank began an ambitious digital transformation journey in 2015, from which time the bank has launched a host of diverse digital banking solutions to deliver enhanced convenience, speed, and efficiency to customers. 
Extending these services to the rural areas of the country as well, the bank has gained unparalleled success in turning Sri Lanka into a digital society. Bearing testament to the bank’s ability to take technology to the masses, People’s Bank’s Mobile Banking App remains the most downloaded banking app in the country. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, People’s Bank Mobile Service covered over 1,000 rural townships to enable access to banking and finances to customers even in the most remote areas. The service was further enhanced with Palmtop Banking to allow customers to withdraw and deposit money without the use of an ATM card. 
Further, in order to soften the COVID-19 impact on the overall economy, the Bank swiftly implemented a range of relief packages including moratoria mandated by the government and provided relief to over 480,000 individual customers which is the highest number by a bank in Sri Lanka. 
People’s Bank also introduced multiple loan schemes to support the economic revival of the country. These schemes were offered to a large cross-section of groups included doctors, dentists, engineers, accountants, IT professionals/software engineers, healthcare professionals, school teachers, university staff members, students and artists. To further enhance the customer experience, the bank introduced a Retail Loan Originating System (RLOS) to over 100 branches thus enabling customers to obtain personal loans in 24 hours.
People’s Bank which also pioneered the pawning business in Sri Lanka came up with a range of concessions to help pawning customers during this difficult period. This included reducing interest rates and introducing a facility that allowed partial pawning payments to be made via Self Banking Units anytime of the day. 
These initiatives are a testament to the bank’s commitment to delivering superior experiences to their customers, by leveraging on its digital banking supremacy.

Following the success of the first batch of technical series 2019-2020, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in collaboration with Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is organising the second batch of the technical series titled ‘Preparing a Sustainability Report’ on 15, 17, 22 June, from 10:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. 
The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an independent international standard-setting organisation that helps businesses and governments worldwide understand and communicate their impact on critical sustainability issues such as climate change, human rights, governance and social wellbeing.
GRI pioneered sustainability reporting in the late 1990s and has since become the globally accepted standard for enabling business, governments and other organisations to understand and communicate their impacts on critical sustainability issues. Today the framework is being used by governments, financial regulators, capital markets, businesses in more than 100 countries around the world. GRI has also been working very closely with the UN to move businesses to report clearly on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
While Sri Lanka does not currently have a regulation that mandates sustainability reporting, the practice is encouraged by the voluntary adoption under the Code of Best practice on Corporate Governance issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CASL) together with The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC). GRI South Asia in collaboration with CSE actively engaged with listed companies through a series of workshops, sessions and, virtual roundtables. As a result, we have seen five-time rise in sustainability reporting and six-fold rise in GRI reports among the listed companies (from 2013 to 2019). 
Furthermore, it has been established that reporting on impacts using GRI, helps organisations better anticipate risk, and develop strategy for long term sustainability of the business. 
CSE in collaboration with GRI, launched the ESG Guidance document titled ‘Communicating Sustainability: Six Recommendations for Listed Companies Version 02’. The technical series will refer to this publication and several other GRI resources and tools to support participating companies to prepare a GRI Standard based report. In addition to this we will also invite practitioners and experts from various organisation to share their perspectives, tips, experience and expectations from reporters.
In this high value, professional workshop, we will discover why it makes business sense to adopt sustainable business practices, how to monitor, manage and communicate on your performance. The workshop will be facilitated by GRI South Asia. In addition to GRI and CSE, external experts are also invited to share their perspectives and experience from DNV, Ernst & Young, KPMG and invited speakers from Listed companies in Sri Lanka. It is an ideal opportunity for listed companies to start their reporting journey. 
The technical series is exclusive for listed companies and large companies in Sri Lanka (manager and above) from diverse departments who would contribute to preparing the sustainability report of the organisation (e.g.: CSR or sustainable development department of the company, HR, communication, finance, operation, corporate planning, risk, health and safety). No prior knowledge on CSR/Sustainability is required for attending the series. This is a three-part workshop series.
There is no registration fee for attending the technical series i.e. all the three workshops. However, seats are limited to the first 40 companies to register. You are requested to nominate maximum up to two representatives from your organisation. The participants should commit to initiating sustainability reporting process within their organisation and should participate proactively in all the three workshops of the series. Participants of the technical series will receive a certificate on successful completion of the technical series.
For registration details please send a mail to chanuka@cse.lk on or before 10 June. First come, first served basis is applicable.

Primary auctions produce mixed results
Reduction in money market liquidity continues


By Wealth Trust Securities

Activity in the secondary bond market remained moderated during the week ending 4 June as most market participants continued to be on the sidelines. Limited activity was witnessed on the maturities of 2022s (i.e., 01.10.22, 15.11.22 and 15.12.22), 2023s (i.e., 15.01.23, 15.03.23, 15.07.23, 01.09.23 and 15.11.23), 01.05.25, 2026s (i.e., 15.01.26 and 01.02.26), and 15.08.27 at levels of 5.62% to 5.70%, 5.65% to 5.70%, 5.80%, 5.78%, 6.00%, 6.12% to 6.14%, 6.22%, 6.28% to 6.33%, 7.00% to 7.01%, 7.30% to 7.34%, 7.30% and 7.53%, respectively.

Pan Asia Bank said new funding lines are to drive growth amongst the Bank’s micro, small and medium enterprise customers
 


Successfully finalises $ 25 m financing from European-based FFIs hot on the heels of $ 100 m previously secured; lines up a further $ 35 m


Cementing its reputation as a valued partner for global Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs), Pan Asia Bank was successful in finalising approximately $ 25 million (equivalent to Rs. 5 billion) senior debt lines from reputed European-based FFIs recently. 
Further, $ 35 million funding lines, equal to approximately Rs. 6.8 billion will be extended by few other leading FFIs in the coming months to drive growth amongst the Bank’s Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) clientele. This achievement is all the more commendable as it comes amidst a global pandemic when the competition for funding is intense globally.
Commenting on the accomplishment, Pan Asia Bank Deputy General Manager – Treasury Richie Dias said: “We are privileged to be one of the few Sri Lankan banks to be chosen by the globally respected FFIs to extend medium term funding lines closer to $ 25 million and this reflects the financial strength, stability, good governance and the Bank’s prudent futuristic strategies. These partnerships were facilitated by TSW Capital Services, a leading financial advisory institution based in India.” 
He said Pan Asia Bank has performed exceptionally well in the year 2020 by surpassing the Rs. 2 billion milestone in Profit After Tax. In 2021, the Bank has already recorded the best-ever first quarter results amidst challenging times with Profit After Tax soaring by 81% to post Rs. 750 million. 
“Before this new funding arrangement, Pan Asia Bank had already raised $ 100 million worth of funding lines from reputed FFIs for long- and medium-term tenures. Securing the new funding lines at such a challenging time is a testimonial to Pan Asia Bank’s growing respect in regional and global banking circles and the trust placed in us by FFIs worldwide,” Dias added.
Forging ahead on its green journey, PABC became the first Sri Lankan bank to partner with the Switzerland-based Symbiotics for its first green bond issuance in 2020. These initiatives led PABC to be awarded as the ‘Best Green Bank’ accolade by the prestigious Global Banking and Finance Review Awards 2020, for demonstrating expertise and excellence within the global financial community. The Bank was awarded the ‘Fastest Growing Commercial Bank Sri Lanka 2021’ and ‘Best Treasury and Cash Management Bank’ Sri Lanka 2021 at the International Business Magazine Awards.
Positioned as the Truly Sri Lankan Bank, Pan Asia Bank supports MSMEs at the grassroots partnering them to prosperity through green financing. Pan Asia Bank believes that extending green funding will create the perfect opportunity to generate long term sustainable economic benefits to uplift the living standards of people by creating cost-efficient energy solutions for businesses and employment, while also preserving the environment by promoting renewable energy.
Pan Asia Bank, with its island-wide network of 85 branches, identifies deserving projects island wide. Under the guidance of the Development Banking Division of Pan Asia Bank, a few of recent such engagements are papaya cultivation projects at Beragama village within the Ambalantota Divisional Secretariat, using novel methodologies with Drip Irrigation solutions since it lies in the dry zone. The Bank also arranged for cultivators to sign Forward Sales Agreements with the main buyer exporting hard green papaya to Middle-Eastern countries. 
Further, the Bank has also assigned a dedicated Micro Finance Officer, attached to its Monaragala Branch, to establish relationships between the farmers and other stakeholders. 
In its latest green lending initiative, Pan Asia Bank has provided irrigation facility to sugarcane farmers in Monaragala in partnership with Lanka Sugar Company Pelwatte – to set up a modern irrigation system along with energy efficient practices in great extent through the proposed irrigation system to improve productivity and yield.

Retains 33rd position in Brand Finance 100 Most Valuable Brands in Sri Lanka with Brand Rating of AA







Ceylinco Life Head Office

 




Ceylinco Life has once again been ranked the most valuable life insurance brand in Sri Lanka in 2021 in the 18th edition of the Brand Finance rankings of the country’s most valuable brands.
The world’s leading brand valuation consultancy assigned Ceylinco Life a Brand Value of Rs. 3,508 million for 2021 and an overall Brand Value Rank of 33, a position that has been retained since last year, amongst the 100 most valuable brands in the country which include the largest banks, telcos and retail giants in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka’s life insurance market leader for the past 17 years, Ceylinco Life also received an ‘AA’ Brand Rating from Brand Finance this year.
Commenting on the brand’s leadership in its sector, Ceylinco Life General Manager Marketing Samitha Hemachandra said: “We believe that the brand is very much more than a visual depiction of a company’s identity. It must evoke, in the minds of all stakeholders, the core values and ethos that the company lives by. This is achieved by ensuring that everything we do lives up to the promise of the brand, building trust and confidence that is then instantly associated with it. The Ceylinco Life brand is now entrenched as a representation of how Ceylinco Life helps de-risk the future of millions of people through the protection the company offers.”
According to Brand Finance, the Brand Value is computed on the basis of separate values assigned for Brand Strength, Business Performance and External Changes. It is described as a specific asset valuation which calculates the value of the transferable element of the brand, generally comprising the value of the trademarks and associated intellectual property.
Brand Finance calculates the values of the brands in its league tables using the Royalty Relief approach – a brand valuation method compliant with the industry standards set in ISO 10668. It involves estimating the likely future revenues that are attributable to a brand by calculating a royalty rate that would be charged for its use, to arrive at a ‘brand value’ understood as a net economic benefit that a brand owner would achieve by licensing the brand in the open market.
London headquartered Brand Finance is the world’s leading independent, value-based brand strategy consultancy, with offices in over 20 countries, including Sri Lanka. Brand Finance bridges the gap between marketing and finance by quantifying the financial value of brands. Brand Finance helped craft the internationally recognised standard on Brand Valuation – ISO 10668, and the standard on Brand Evaluation – ISO 20671.
Ceylinco Life ended 2020 with its total assets surpassing Rs. 150 billion, total consolidated income of Rs. 36.98 billion, gross written premium income of Rs. 22.07 billion, a Life Fund of Rs. 106.74 billion, an investment portfolio of Rs. 133.7 billion, and net profit of Rs. 6.93 billion.
Voted the ‘Peoples Life Insurance Service Provider of the Year’ for a record 15th consecutive year in 2021, Ceylinco Life has been Sri Lanka’s leading life insurer for more than half of the 33 years it has been in existence. In 2020, the Company was certified as a ‘Great Workplace’ in Sri Lanka by Great Place to Work, was named the ‘Best Life Insurer in Sri Lanka’ for the seventh consecutive year by World Finance, and accorded an ‘Honourable Mention’ as one of the ‘Most Admired Companies in Sri Lanka’ by the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL) in collaboration with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), UK. 
Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies and is acknowledged as a benchmark in the local insurance sector for innovation, product research and development, customer service, professional development, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility.

NDB Bank holds a virtual signing ceremony with Axion Solutions and OneConnect
 
 

National Development Bank PLC will be the first company in Sri Lanka to commence development of a Video Know-your-customer (vKYC) as a part of the significant strides the Bank has made in Sri Lanka’s fast evolving digital landscape.
The Bank appointed international enterprise software solutions partner specialising in digital transformation, Axion Solutions, to implement world-class vKYC solutions built by OneConnect Financial Technology Co., Ltd., the leading technology-as-a-service platform provider and an associate of Ping An Group. 
With OneConnect’s vKYC, NDB Bank will be the first in Sri Lanka to roll out AI-based vKYC enabling customers to access banking services such as opening bank accounts, and applying for loans and credit cards remotely and safely so that Sri Lankans can live their lives and run their businesses as usual amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. 
NDB Bank Director/Group CEO Dimantha Seneviratne stated that while digitisation has improved substantially during the recent past in Sri Lanka’s banking industry, NDB has continued to remain at the forefront, constantly introducing novel methods to the Bank’s clients. “With this engagement we are taking steps to align with the National Roadmap for Digitalisation of Payment Services by enabling e-KYC and video KYC based customer onboarding. As the Best Digital Bank of 2021, we are frequently at the forefront of technological changes and are involved in exploring, investing in and developing the digital arena in banking and have dedicated ourselves to become Sri Lanka’s Digital Bank of Choice.”
This is the first time a Sri Lankan bank is able to leverage the best-in-class features to engage customers remotely, securely and efficiently. OneConnect’s vKYC platform goes beyond traditional video conferencing platform and is designed to meet the stringent requirements of the banking and insurance sector. 
The salient features of OneConnect’s vKYC solution: 

Standardises interview workflow for different lines of business such as lending, banking and insurance to minimise human biasness. 
Saves post-interview verification time using Electronic Know-Your-Customer (eKYC) tools such as facial recognition to verify in real-time a customer’s identity against an ID card. 
Complies with banking regulatory guidelines with built-in audit workflows. All video recordings of the interviews are geo-tagged, time-stamped, and stored securely.
Enhances customer experience with appointment scheduling function to skip the queue and shorten waiting time. 
Ensures a seamless experience for customers as vKYC platform uses web mobile interface and customers do not have to download separate mobile app unnecessarily.

Axion Solutions Co-founder and CEO Sharada Kirinde said: “Technology is borderless, and we’re delighted to have successfully bridged the needs of local businesses in Sri Lanka local with world-class solution providers like OneConnect. NDB Bank has chosen OneConnect for its extensive domain expertise and proven technologies that have helped financial institutions across Southeast Asia to succeed in their digital transformation. Today, we are heartened to witness the satisfaction of a client and a partner. We look forward to more collaboration with NDB Bank and OneConnect where we introduce more innovative solutions for the greater good of the people.”
OneConnect Financial Technology CEO (Southeast Asia) Tan Bin Ru said, “Today’s event is very meaningful for OneConnect on multiple fronts. It marks our second collaboration in Sri Lanka and our capabilities in understanding the stringent FI requirements and building innovative vKYC solutions within a short span of time. I’m equally heartened to see our vKYC solution being picked by a leading bank in Sri Lanka to deploy vKYC for the first time in the country. It is truly a mark of confidence of which the financial institutions have for our technologies and capabilities. We are confident that our vKYC will give a strong competitive edge as a quick-to-market solution that allows NDB Banks to tap on this emerging need for remote banking, scale and deliver superb onboarding and credit application experience for Sri Lankans.”

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has once again been declared the ‘Best Bank in Sri Lanka’ at the 2021 FinanceAsia Country Awards, taking its place among global and regional giants adjudged the best domestic banks in their respective countries.
This is the 10th occasion that Commercial Bank has been bestowed this prestigious accolade by FinanceAsia, which is acknowledged as the presenter of one of the best-known and most credible sets of awards in Asia’s financial services industry.
Ranked alongside Commercial Bank this year are banks of the calibre of ICBC (China), DBS (Singapore), Shinhan Bank (South Korea), Bank of China (Hong Kong), CTBC (Taiwan), HDFC Bank (India), MCB Bank (Pakistan), The City Bank (Bangladesh), Public Bank (Malaysia), Bank Central Asia (Indonesia), KBank (Thailand), Techcombank (Vietnam) and BDO Unibank (Philippines).
“We are delighted to win this important award for the 10th time, especially because it is based on an in-depth evaluation of our performance in one of the most difficult years in memory,” Commercial Bank Managing Director S. Renganathan said. “We are also enthused by the fact that the assessment for this year’s award was expanded to cover sustainability indicators as well as our response to the global pandemic.”
The FinanceAsia Country Awards are based on the respective banks’ performance, encompassing key events of the year, financial results including profits, NPL ratios, provisioning, return on equity, capital adequacy ratios, total assets, loans, deposits, branch network, vision and long-term strategy, market position versus the nearest competitor, principal sources of profit, and feedback of stock market analysts.
Over the past year however, FinanceAsia says two other new trends started to make themselves felt in these awards: environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors became an essential topic of conversation, and COVID-19 accelerated the entry of retail investors into many of the region’s equity markets, facilitated by advancing digitalisation.
Commenting on the awards, the magazine said: “For the second year running, FinanceAsia’s Country Awards have taken place against the backdrop of a raging pandemic. Asia’s banking industry has performed remarkably well, supporting clients in tandem with government schemes and taking a conservative stance on provisioning. Some of this year’s winners have had a record year and there has been a roster of sizeable and significant equity, debt and M&A deals.”
FinanceAsia added: “During the awards pitching process, it was impressive and inspiring to hear what banks are doing to improve their own carbon footprint and help companies transition to cleaner forms of energy, better governance and societal wellbeing.”
Factors that contributed to Commercial Bank being adjudged the Best Bank in Sri Lanka are markers from the Bank’s 2020 performance, such as Market Capitalisation, Gross Income, Profit before Tax, Profit after Tax, Total Assets, Total Deposits, Gross Loans, Market Share of Deposits, Market Share of Loans and CASA Ratio.
Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC is the largest private sector commercial bank, and the third largest bank overall in Sri Lanka in terms of total assets, which stood at Rs. 1.736 trillion. ($ 9.285 billion) as at the end of 2020. It is the only private sector bank that has been designated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as a higher-tier Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB). The Bank accounted for approximately 10.7%, 11.2% and 11.8% of sector Loans and Advances, Deposits and Assets respectively in 2020.
The Bank’s asset quality is one of the best in the industry, while its Current Accounts and Savings Accounts (CASA) made up 42.72% of total deposits in 2020, the highest among the peer banks.
Key activities in 2020 included the launch of 18 new products and services, of which six were ground breaking firsts of their kind in Sri Lanka.
Commercial Bank was one of the leading banks in the country in providing pandemic relief to its customers. The Bank implemented its own relief schemes for different customer segments in addition to complying with Central Bank mandated concessions and reduced interest rates across all categories of loans by approximately 4% to 5% p.a. during the first half of 2020.
First published in 1996, FinanceAsia is the world’s foremost information source on the Asian financial markets. Published 11 times a year in Hong Kong, the magazine provides readers with the latest financial trends, interviews, features and investigative reports. The company is owned by Haymarket Media Ltd., the largest privately-owned publishing group in the UK.

DFCC Bank in its pursuit of becoming one of the most customer centric and digitally enabled banks, has launched ‘Digital Dansala’ powered by the DFCC Virtual Wallet to support local communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The ‘Digital Dansala’ program comes to fruition at a time when the spirit of giving and sharing is growing in strengths amongst Sri Lankans, as we look for ways to support our brothers and sisters who are bearing the brunt of this adverse situation. 
The ‘Digital Dansala’ by DFCC Bank is a first of its kind initiative by a bank in the island, whereby DFCC customers who use the Virtual Wallet will be able to make a cash donation of any value, towards the distribution of dry rations to the local communities across DFCC’s branch network who have been affected by the current situation in the country. 
DFCC Bank will match these donations collected through the ‘Digital Dansala’ that were generously supported by customers, which is in line with the Bank’s sustainability strategy towards building resilient communities. 
The distribution of the dry rations to those affected citizens will be centrally coordinated by the Sustainability Department of the bank in liaison with the 139 branches network around the country.
Powering this initiative is the DFCC Virtual Wallet, which was also a first of its kind mobile virtual wallet product in the Sri Lankan banking industry when it launched in 2015. The Virtual Wallet facilitates a plethora of convenient features such as over 40 billers, institutional payments, transfers via CEFT, ability to pay other bank credit cards, checking the balance of customer’s Current/Savings accounts, Interest rates, Fixed Deposit maturity dates, add beneficiaries to favorites and share CEFT payment advice via email or WhatsApp. 
Furthermore, customers can access a range of functions relating to the credit cards such as adding a DFCC credit card, checking balances, three-month statements, transaction details, cashback reward details, minimum payment due, recent, and unbilled transactions and available balance.  Moreover, in line with the current situation, DFCC Bank has built on more than 25 new features to this channel over the past few months, adding value to existing and new customers. 
In order to support this initiative DFCC customers can now access the ‘Donations’ option, in their Virtual Wallet app to make the donation. Initially, the users need to login using their username and password, following which they click on the ‘Bills’ icon, and then the ‘Donations’ option. Then, the users can select the ‘Digital Dansala’ option and subsequently carry out their donation transaction. 
Any non DFCC Bank customers can open an account via Online Account opening option available on the website from the safety of their home and then activate the DFCC Virtual Wallet to donate funds using the debit card or calling the 24/7 hotline 2350000.
Commenting on this initiative, DFC CEO Lakshman Silva said, “We as a nation are collectively going through one of the toughest periods of our times as I recall. While our dedicated frontline workers are engaged in protecting the people from the health adversity, essential services such as financial institutions need to work towards offsetting the financial adversity people are facing. In this regard, DFCC Bank believes it is important to go beyond the confines of the norms, and aptly integrate digital technology to assist during these challenging times. With the DFCC Virtual Wallet’s ‘Digital Dansala,’ the human need to give and share is made accessible to our customers, whereby they are given an opportunity to play a role toward donating whatever they wish to  assist those affected – the nation on its way towards recovery.”

Only banking brand to surpass the Rs. 50 b mark
Brand value at Rs. 53 b with a 12% growth YOY








BOC Chairman Kanchana Ratwatte


 





BOC GM D.P.K. Gunasekara




The Bank of Ceylon (BOC) has recorded a significant achievement in its 81-year journey in the Sri Lankan banking and finance industry by reaching the brand value of Rs. 53 billion and continuing to lead as the No. 1 Banking Brand in Sri Lanka for the 13th consecutive year. 
BOC is a hallmark for trust and the stability in the Sri Lankan banking and finance industry. Being a state sector institution, BOC has clearly become a role model as a responsible Corporate Citizen in Sri Lanka. It has not only proven its financial strength but also demonstrated its commitment to serve the needs of the nation especially during crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“It is the bank’s utmost priority to sustain its growth together with all communities and the bank pays due attention to the overall socio-economic progress of the country. The bank acts as a key financier for Sri Lankan businesses, ranging from start-ups to well-established corporates, driving economic growth. BOC’s financial strength and operational capacity enables us to set the direction for the banking and financial services industry in the country. And we will ensure that we maintain the integrity of the country’s banking sector through stringent measures, while taking the lead in economic revival, through SME and local entrepreneurship development. We wish to share this achievement with all our valued stakeholders and look forward to expanding our value creation for our nation,” BOC Chairman Kanchana Ratwatte said.  
“Aligning itself with the Government’s initiatives to counter the socio-economic downturn in Sri Lanka, BOC recorded the highest disbursement under the ‘Saubagya’ Working Capital Loan scheme of 18,589 facilities, worth Rs. 39.1 billion, while moratorium facilities were valued at over Rs. 589.4 billion. While posting robust results, we also achieved the highest reported industry profit for the year 2020 of Rs. 23.6 billion (PBT). Our Inward Remittances also recorded $ 2.8 billion for the same year. We intend to lead the way through innovation and keep a keen insight into the aspirations of people as always. With this strategy we were able to face the economic turmoil with a renewed sense of purpose and strategies to aid thousands of individuals and businesses across the country to survive these challenging times. Our efforts to explore new avenues, with innovative HR and IT solutions to serve customers were fruitful,” Ratwatte added.Through multiple channels and its multi-faceted nature, the bank has served its customers through a diverse range of products and services. From its very first branch established in Colombo Fort, BOC has expanded its reach to a network of 646 branches and 1,366 ATM/CDM/CRM units locally, and four overseas branches in Malé and Hulhumalé in the Maldives, Chennai, India, and the Seychelles. BOC also operates a subsidiary in London.
The core strength of Brand ‘BOC’ is the ability to uplift any person or business, and the trust it has earned by proving it time and time again. The bank’s financial strength surpasses Rs. 3 trillion in assets, over Rs. 2 trillion loans and advances and over Rs. 2.5 trillion in deposits. 
BOC General Manager D.P.K. Gunasekera said: “Whilst thanking all our valued customers and my fellow staff members, I like to remind you that, the pandemic has become a test for all brands - a time that has revealed inherent strengths and the core values that drive brand value. In this context the pandemic revealed the dependability of Bank of Ceylon as a partner to individuals and businesses. The ability to maintain this unwavering trust has come with the stability the bank has shown in sustaining growth and expansion in its financial strength, operational capacity, digital and technological adaptability, and its strategic approach and responsiveness to situations.” 
“BOC has always been vigilant that the distribution of its value creation covers the entire country with special attention being given to socio-economically disadvantaged areas. In terms of resource allocation, Bank of Ceylon has taken a keen interest in financial inclusiveness and expanding digital penetration to rural areas in the country to uplift the socio-economic standard. BOC is a brand that indirectly represents both the strength of the state and state institutions. Managing rigorous marketing communications that utilise all physical and digital components of communications available during these limited marketing conditions, BOC invested responsibly in keeping its customers updated continuously with important messages on enabling their financial needs,” Gunasekera added.
In addition, BOC expanded its customer touch points beyond the 2,000-mark over the last year, that includes its physical branch network along with its ATM/CDM and CRM network to reach every part of the country. Further, the staff of the bank worked tirelessly to provide the best service possible even at high points of the pandemic, whilst ensuring maximum precautions to safeguard customers and themselves. This approach enabled the majority of customers to connect with the brand and seamlessly carry out their banking needs in a safe and secure manner. 
Becoming the ‘Most Valuable Banking Brand’ essentially involves fully embracing the responsibility of operating with a high social and environmental conscience BOC has clearly demonstrated this over its more than 81 years of existence and humbly assures all its stakeholders of its commitment to these principles in the years to come.

Top economist and senior banker, Dr. Kenneth De Zilwa assumed duties as the fifth Chairman of LankaClear after being appointed by the Central Bank Governor Prof. W.D. Lakshman for a term of three years effective from 1 June 2021. He succeeded another veteran banker, Anil Amarasuriya who completed an illustrious six-years as the Chairman.
Established in 2002, LankaClear is the operator of the country’s national payment network – LankaPay and is regarded as one of the most successful public-private partnerships in the region. Functioning under the guidance and supervision of the Central Bank, the Company has been playing a key role towards the financial sector growth and stability by facilitating domestic interbank payments and settlements by driving payment technology innovations and promoting cashless payments in the country thereby harnessing financial inclusivity.

No one debates the fact that Bitcoin is backed by the most revolutionary impending advancement of technology
 

Very few, if any at all of us, have not heard of Bitcoin and the accompanying cryptocurrencies at this point. Over the last few months and for most of this year, the conversation and buzz surrounding the topic of what is now declared the newest global asset class has been growing steadily louder. It’s fair to say the volume was cranked to the top over the last month with Elon Musk, Goldman Sachs, the IRS and the likes joining the conversation. 

What is Bitcoin and blockchain technology?
Bitcoin is a digital currency which is speculated to have been discovered in January of 2009 as a white paper which was circulated in online forums by a hitherto mysterious founder – Satoshi Nakamoto. With a founding story fitting of the notoriety it has gained since then, Bitcoin then proceeded to be a technology project which set in motion the events leading to development of blockchain technology. 
To gloss over much of the detail, blockchain technology is a protocol which enables publicly visible transactional chains in a network of peer-to-peer nodes. The technology is simply referred to as a digitised ledger, but uniquely one that doesn’t allow tampering and reversals given its decentralised nature. 
Simply put, blockchain technology is a record of secure transactions maintained by a wide network of computers. Naturally, the technology has a use case as a currency and payment protocol in addition to being widely applicable in healthcare to maintain medical records, in education to store exam results, in logistics to track asset mobilisation and in government to maintain public records of national budgets; among an infinite list of other use cases. 
Bitcoin, on the other hand is the first manifestation of this technology and was in its early form a digital currency with anonymity and secure transactability. The most current conversation around Bitcoin largely considers it to be a store of value, much like gold. In fact, much of the conversation is centred on the idea that Bitcoin will soon replace gold as a storage medium for value. 

The value of Bitcoin
The concept of value is a far more complicated matter than one may think on initial terms. Value in our everyday lives quite loosely translates to price; in that, the value of a good or service is interchangeable with its price. This is a good place to start the conversation. The idea that price, as determined by the aggregate demand and supply for a good or service is the value of the said good or service is based on the process of price discovery. 
While price discovery in the marketplace is a reliable method to determine value of an asset, there are instances when an asset falls outside of this criterion. Firstly, investors, especially value investors are inquisitive of the actual value for an asset in order to understand what its future value will be. In this particular event, current price discovery is a less than reliable measure of actual value. The value of an asset in a period of 5 or 10 years into the future is far removed from its current value. In this situation, investors resort to assessing the fundamental value of the asset in question. 
This is where the controversy starts for Bitcoin. Unlike more tangible assets such as land, assessing the fundamental value of Bitcoin is a difficult task. On the one hand, Bitcoin is on a mission to replace gold, an age-old asset with a market value near $ 9 trillion. On the other hand, Bitcoin is seldom accepted by institutions such as banks and governments, a critical aspect that affords gold much of its value. 
Adding to the difficulty in assessing fundamental value, Bitcoin prices are highly volatile. In the past month of May, Bitcoin lost nearly 60% of its total value in the market and regained most of it in a period of a few days. This level of volatility is unheard of in any other mainstream asset class. 

The dip
In trading terms, the dip is a loss of value experienced by an asset as a result of the asset being oversold or exceeding demand in supply. The selling pressure of Bitcoin in the market over the last few weeks caused Bitcoin to lose over half of its value, cleanly erasing the value of many investors’ portfolio and also pulling the cryptocurrency market now estimated to be nearly $ 2.2 trillion under with it. This volatility and the crash appeared to confirm the idea of Bitcoin opponents that the entire asset is trading in a bubble. Of course, the story doesn’t end there. 
In a period of less than a week, Bitcoin recovered most of its value back, proving that the volatility applies both ways and that the process of price discovery in the market is not completely unable to correct the asset price.
Of course, this yo-yo momentum raises many questions that need immediate answers against the backdrop of Bitcoin being declared as an accepted asset class by Goldman Sachs Bank. 
Now more than ever, the questions of what is fair value for Bitcoin and what fundamental principles are involved in determining that value need answers that investor communities, institutions and the general public can agree on.

Inflationary hedging
Part of the reason why Bitcoin is attractive to investors is the inflationary protection it provides. In uncertain economies like Sri Lanka where the depreciation of the Rupee is controlled by restrictions imposed on imports and through tight foreign currency regulations, Bitcoin is a sound investment avenue. 
Inflationary loss of value is a concern for any investor, on the basis that the true value of their investments deteriorates under the weight of an under-performing currency. Estimates of inflationary impact are debated over anywhere between 10% to 25% annually. Bitcoin as an asset class even with the intensity of its volatility has been successful in returning an astounding 4,822,525% return over a decade at its highest trading price recorded in February this year. If historical figures are anything to go by, it’s difficult to imagine an asset class that can compare with Bitcoin. 

The fair value conversation
At long last, with the facts established, the final question emerges: what is fair value for Bitcoin and how should it be assessed? 
To be clear, there is no widely accepted answer to this question. 
Sentiments and opinions on the matter vary wildly; with Warren Buffet calling Bitcoin “rat poison squared,” and Max Keiser quoted stating “Bitcoin is the currency of resistance.” The global conversation is very much open ended and for now, the conclusion can only be speculated on.
But here is what we know. 
No one debates the fact that Bitcoin is backed by the most revolutionary impending advancement of technology. Blockchain technology is largely predicted to potentially have the ability to replace fiat currencies and the internet itself in a truly decentralised way. 
However, Bitcoin is a non-productive asset class with no real intrinsic value at present. In these terms, Bitcoin is valued on the basis of its tradability and the concept that someone else will purchase the asset for a greater value. This in itself is problematic. However, with only 14% of the US population adopting cryptocurrency, it isn’t a bad bet to assume that value will continue to rise with mass adoption. Also, take into consideration the idea that gold too has no real intrinsic value nor productivity except for the value given to it by its tradability. 
On the other hand however, is the question of regulation. China recently made an announcement that it will look to ban cryptocurrency within the country, and the IRS announced intentions to tax and regulate capital gains from cryptocurrency. Regulation is a dangerous spanner in the works for a currency which primarily requires liquidity and acceptance to fulfil its function. 
However, the numbers are still on Bitcoin’s side, with the returns on investments made by early entrants far exceeding any other investment instrument and for the large part delivering effectively on its promise of hedging against inflation. 
With much of the matter discussed, conclusions drawn may differ, but it may appear that Bitcoin is a choice investment class for investors with the risk appetite and holding power to outlast the intense volatility. With certainty, Bitcoin is a consideration at the very least, when allocating assets towards a personal or organisational portfolio of investments.

Hassle-free, automatic monthly settlement of bills of Dialog, CEB, Mobitel and Water Board 
Digital registration for bill settlement service via ComBank website


Automated utility bill payment with no intervention by the customer has brought about a new dimension in convenience for ComBank credit card holders by offering them an option to automatically settle their monthly bills to the country’s most-widely used utilities. 
The latest addition to this convenient, hassle-free bill payment facility is the settlement of Mobitel and Water Board bills.
With travel restrictions and safety concerns due to the pandemic, ComBank credit card holders need not go outside to settle their monthly utility bills. The Bank has announced that its credit card holders can now enrol to Dialog, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Mobitel and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) to settle bills automatically every month via a designated Credit Card.
Further, registration for Automatic Bill Settlement has been simplified, with credit card users being given the option enter their credit card details via the Bank’s website, accept terms and conditions and register, eliminating the need to visit the bank.
“This is the perfect solution for the times we are in, because once a customer registers for the service and links his or her utility accounts to the system, each month’s bill will be paid on time, with no further action required from the customer,” Commercial Bank Deputy General Manager – Marketing Hasrath Munasinghe said. “It is a highly secure and precise form of automated digital payment and we will continue to add more utilities, insurance and mobile bill payment in the future.”
Commercial Bank customers can register their Visa, Mastercard, or UnionPay credit cards for the ‘Auto Bill Pay’ facility. It enables them to easily manage all their utility payments through a single Commercial Bank Credit Card at any given time, and helps them to adopt digital payment habits. After successful registration for the service, each utility or any other entity will present the customer’s monthly bill amount to the bank and bank will authorise the payment on behalf of credit card holder and send the receipt of payment to the customer via e-mail or SMS.
Besides ensuring that bills are settled on time without any involvement from the customer, the Auto Bill Pay facility prevents accumulation of arrears due to unpaid bills, saves customers from delinquency fees and prevents disconnection of utility services due to delayed payments. 
Furthermore, customers can earn Max Loyalty Rewards points that can be redeemed later on at many reputed merchant outlets island-wide.
Apart from this unique facility, ComBank credit card holders get many other benefits, including Year-round promotions offering attractive discounts covering a wide variety of products and services. 
Commercial Bank was the first bank to offer loyalty rewards for both credit and debit Card holders under its Max Loyalty Rewards Points scheme. 
The Bank was also a pioneer in extending promotional discount offers which were traditionally only offered for credit cards to its debit cards. 
Commercial Bank cards are the fastest growing cards in Sri Lanka and enjoy market leadership in credit and debit card cumulative point-of-sale usage. The Bank offers a variety of credit cards in the Silver, Gold and Platinum tiers of Visa, Mastercard and UnionPay, as well as Visa Signature, World Mastercard, Visa Infinite, UnionPay Asia Prestige Platinum and UnionPay Asia Prestige Diamond Cards in the premium segment. The cards are equipped with ‘Tap ‘n Go’ NFC technology and are backed by a strong NFC Point-of-Sale (POS) network.
Sri Lanka’s first wholly carbon neutral bank, the first Sri Lankan bank to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World and the only Sri Lankan bank to be so listed for 10 years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 268 branches and 932 automated machines in Sri Lanka. 
The Bank’s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets; Myanmar, where it has a Microfinance company in Nay Pyi Taw; and the Maldives, where the Bank has a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake.

Amana Takaful Insurance yesterday announced its performance in the General Insurance sector for the first quarter of 2021 to have recorded a 27% YoY growth in Gross Written Premium (GWP), the industry dipstick for insurance sales performance.

The company also reported strong growth in all insurance classes during the first quarter. Its largest non-motor insurance growth segment was Marine Insurance, growing at a staggering 69% compared to 2020. Amana Insurance’s Fire & Engineering Insurance was the second largest growth area in Q1 2021 growing by 38%, while Medical Insurance grew by 35%. The growth in Motor Insurance was also recorded at 19%, one of the highest growth percentages among industry peers.

It is believed that Amana Takaful Insurance’s novel, innovative and customer-centric approach to insurance in Sri Lanka, coupled with its refreshed brand identity that was launched in January 2021, has provided these significant results despite the current macro-economic situation and health challenges within the country.
