17 January 2021,Clearing the hiring hurdles,"In an increasingly competitive world, people have become a cutting-edge factor. Is it simply any people or the right people? Hiring the right person to the right job is important to achieve the right results. I compare hiring to matchmaking. As much as two people get connected through matchmaking, recruiting the right people needs committed attention.There are triple matches needed to be fulfilled to ensure that the right hiring takes place. When people having battered by a planetary pandemic are in search of sustained employment, right selection becomes increasingly critical. Let us see what they are with emphasis on the Sri Lankan context.Right hiringAs researchers observe, a poor hiring decision can cost as much as five times the employee’s salary. The US Department of Labour estimates that a bad hiring decision equals 30 percent of the employee’s first year’s earning potential. In Sri Lanka too, I have personally come across several situations, where companies had to pay badly in the wake of the wrong person being on-board.It is pertinent to mention what David Oglivy, the advertising tycoon, had to say with respect to hiring: “If each of us hires people who are smaller than we are, we shall become a company of dwarfs, but if each of us hires people who are bigger than we are, we will become a company of giants.” To hire people with potential, the hiring process must be professionally designed and executed.Matchmaking in focusAs we know, matchmaking is commonly referred to as the process of matching two people together, usually for the purpose of marriage. The word is also used in the context of sports and business.In the case of business, terms such as “Business to Business (B2B)” matchmaking, Investor Matchmaking, Business Speed Dating and Brokerage Event are used. In essence, real meetings between business people are in focus. Take a trade fair organisation for an example. It uses matchmaking for value creation in providing a meeting point.Hiring is one of the critical people functions of any organisation. In the traditional jargon, it is known as recruitment and selection. Recruitment deals with getting enough applicants as a potential pool. Selection deals with picking the best from the pool. That is where the matchmaking becomes significant.Triple matchesI would argue that there are triple matches you need to ensure in selecting the right candidate to a job. For me, they are T – T match, P – P match and I – I match. Let us discuss what they are.T – T MatchThis is the first match a recruiter would look into. It stands for matching tasks with talent. This essentially refers to the technical dimension. Any key task requires specific talent. Take a sales job for an example. Tasks associated with meeting customers require the talent of caring communication. Talent is now more often used as a bundled word for knowledge, attitude, and skills. Prof. Dave Ulrich in his seminal work, referred to it as a combination of competence, commitment, and contribution. Whichever way you describe, there is a dire need for it.There is an acute gap between required talent and raw talent. The market is abundant with raw talent, especially with school leavers. Are they geared to a demanding job in a target-driven environment? Sadly, the answer is no. We teach complex subject matter but not how to gain confidence. Job-orientation in the academic courses has been recognised as important only of late. That is the way to overcome talent drought.In the global scenario, we have often heard about “winning the war for talent”. It is a term coined by Steven Hankin of McKinsey way back in 1997. A book by Ed Michaels, Helen Handfield-Jones, and Beth Axelrod popularised it in their book highlighting an increasingly competitive landscape for recruiting and retaining talented employees. They stress the need to have a set of superior Human Resources processes, but a mindset that emphasises the importance of talent to the success of organisations.P – P MatchWhat I mean here is the match between person and the position. It goes beyond the talent level. Primary focus here is psychological. Overall fit with regards to the personality of the individual and the key expectation of the position he or she is supposed to hold.Let us be clear about personality. The term originates from the Latin word, persona, which means a mask. In ancient Latin theatres, a mask was used to represent a character. In other words, it is what you show to the world, by way of your words and deeds.There are a variety of ways of looking at personality. It is the particular combination of emotional, attitudinal, and behavioural response patterns of an individual. Researchers tend to define it as enduring, distinctive thoughts, emotions, and behaviour that characterise the way an individual adapts to the world. The key highlight here is the adaptation. From the womb to the tomb, it is a journey of adaptation, with constant interaction with the surroundings.The point I want to make here is simple. Different personalities suit different positions. An outgoing, talkative and a friendly person would be more suited for a sales position, whereas a quiet, thinking, and analytical person would be better in handling a laboratory position.A key challenge for HR practitioners is to determine what type of a personality is associated with a candidate and also what type of a personality is ideally required by a specific position. Well-developed tools associated with psychometric testing can be very handy in this context.I – I MatchThe final match is between the individual and the institution. Essentially it checks the fit between the prospective candidate and the “surroundings”. It can be the culture, climate, or the overall style of management. Thus, we can see the socio-cultural dimension in focus. As I have seen many times high performers in one setup would end up being lousy performers in another setup. This is sad but significant, in ensuring the long-term wellbeing of people.First key element here is the culture. Organisational or corporate culture is the pattern of values, norms, beliefs, attitudes, and assumptions that may not have been articulated but shape the ways in which people behave and things get done. In a more detailed manner, Edgar Schein defines culture as follows:“A pattern of basic assumptions – invented, discovered, or developed by a given group as it learns to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration- that have worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think and feel in relation to those problems.”Stemming from culture comes the more visible element,climate. It refers to those aspects of the environment that are consciously perceived by organisational members. Hence, climate is something people see, hear, and feel. That is why we see a difference when we enter a hospital, police station or a restaurant. In summary, climate is what we see and feel when we enter an organisation, whereas culture is something much deeper as bedrock.What is important here is the need of prospective candidates to appreciate the institutional culture. What one can do in a multinational corporation might not be possible in a family-owned business. Same gulf exists between private and public sectors. I have seen people who opted to work in non-governmental charity organisations have a higher sense of humanity with committed service in mind. It might be the same with a brilliant management trainee joining a rapidly expanding global network. The obvious sign is the need to ensure individual – institutional match.Figure 1 contains the summary of the triple matches.Ensuring triple matchesA properly designed assessment centre can be one solid way to ensure all three matches. It typically employs a variety of techniques and multiple observers in a closed setting to evaluate candidates. Key challenge is to design the centre to cover all three matches.T –T match is the easiest to assess, provided you identify what talent is exactly required by the task. A process where candidates are given a set of questions to answer, situations to analyse or activities to perform would give a clear idea about where the candidate would stand.P - P match can be done by a more in-depth analysis using personality-type diagnosing instruments such as Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). One challenge is to clearly identify what type of personality is required for the position. A sad local scene is that companies heavily investing on psychometric testing, without getting the best use of the results obtained.I – I match can be found by a good set of interview questions that would assess the attitude of candidates. Particularly, referring to “what-if” scenarios show-casing organisations’ real issues would be a smart move. Case study analysis can also be handy to find the right fit.Way forwardSri Lankan organisations can enhance their hiring professionalism by way of ensuring the triple matches. It will pave the way not only for higher organisational performance but also for better employee satisfaction. This is more crucial in the context of Covid-19 where there is a degree of “under-employment” involving people looking for better prospects."
14 June 2020,Only the fast and nimble will survive - Pathfinder ,"Now that Sri Lanka has achieved notable success in containing the danger posed by the pandemic to the health of the nation, the time has come for a concerted and decisive focus on reviving the economy.A Pathfinder Foundation Study Group produced a report which set out a new economic vision for post-Covid-19 Sri Lanka. An important recommendation in the report was the pursuit of trade agreements.The Doha Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations is at an impasse. It has probably been dealt a fatal blow with the disengagement of the current US administration from the WTO. Many countries have responded by pursuing bilateral, regional and plurilateral trade agreements to boost growth and employment prospects. Sri Lanka has fallen behind and is confronted with the possibility of falling even further behind.The Sri Lankan authorities have done well to stabilise the external position of the country despite the extreme shock delivered by the pandemic to Sri Lanka’s key sources of foreign exchange: remittances; apparel exports; tourism receipts; earnings from shipping, FDI inflows; foreign institutional investment in government securities and the stock market; as well as the prospects of raising money from international capital markets.However, the temporary import bans and the decline in oil prices have served to mitigate the worst effects of these adverse trends.The effectiveness of these measures is reflected in the forex market, where the Rupee has been largely stable after its initial sharp depreciation to Rs. 199: USD. It has now stabilised around Rs. 186: USD.However, the economy is in a sub-optimal equilibrium as far as growth and employment prospects are concerned. There have been some green shoots of recovery in exports of apparel, seafood, tea and some rubber products. However, this is far from sufficient to support the country’s ambitions on growth and employment.For this to happen, Sri Lanka has to work towards a transformation of its export and FDI performance. This has proved elusive so far.The measures needed to achieve this are well known. They must now be implemented effectively and trade agreements need to be an integral part of this effort. "
14 February 2021,SEC and CSE meet stockbrokers,Officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) met the CEOs of the stockbroker firms to discuss the status of the stock market on Thursday.The stockbrokers expressed their views with regard to the information that has been called for by the circular issued by the CSE.The stockbrokers expressed the view that there had been some misconception that this information was to be gathered to curtail the credit that has been extended by the stockbroker firms.
8 December 2019,Shares to be listed and traded in foreign currencies,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is ready with the framework for foreign listed entities to trade on the multi currency board which will enable overseas companies to gain value for their shares, said a senior official of the CSE on the sidelines of a media get-together last Thursday.He said the CSE is ready and it is a matter of getting through the Memoranda of Understanding with the foreign listed companies, to commence listing of overseas entities for trading of shares.The CSE commenced work on the proposed multi currency board in 2016 to provide an opportunity for foreign listed companies to list on the Board where trading in strong currencies will be made available.According to the CSE official, many foreign entities from the Maldives and Bangladesh have expressed an interest in listing on the Board. A foreign company that seeks a listing, has to be first listed on the Stock Exchange of that country.The multi currency board offers foreign companies an opportunity to access a diversified pool of investors through Sri Lanka where shares of foreign companies can be listed and traded within Sri Lanka, in a foreign currency. CSE Chairman Ray Abeywardhane said since the completion of the presidential election on November 16 there has been an upsurge in the market with greater positive sentiments among investors who had been holding back on investing, till stability and direction was restored in the country.“We have seen the indices moving up in recent weeks following the tough time that the SCE went through and we hope the growth momentum will continue in the coming months enticing more companies to list on the stock exchange and increase their shares volumes,” Abeywardhane said, adding that there needs to be lot more push as there is much expectation from investors on equity investments.The daily turnover at the CSE has increased from an average of around Rs. 600 million to over 725 million and volume in terms of number of trades has too, increased according to CSE data.“There is an air of expectation that the market will improve with greater volumes of trading,” Abeywardhane said. However, despite the positive sentiments among local investors net selling by foreign investors amounting to over Rs. 1.5 billion has been seen in the recent days. The CSE expects to have more investment instruments in the stock exchange. The Rs. 2.29 trillion Employees Provident Fund was restricted from investing in the CSE since 2016.The CSE is hopeful that listings in the ‘Empower Board’ (set up by the CSE to provide a platform for small and medium sector enterprises to raise capital), will have SME entities listing in the coming year."
14 March 2021,Kala Pola 2021 goes online!,"Kala Pola - Sri Lanka’s annual art fair showcasing and promoting visual art – went online for the first time in its 28-year history on srilankanartgallery.com/kalapola on February 21. The event showcases over 4,000 works by over 200 artists ranging from senior artists to amateur/student artists.Kala Pola has provided opportunities for painters and sculptors to showcase and market their creations to increasing audiences each year since its launch in 1993. Presented by The George Keyt Foundation in association with the John Keells Group, Kala Pola has grown to become an event not to be missed in Colombo’s annual cultural calendar. Due to restrictions on large scale gatherings following the Covid pandemic, the organisers sought to mitigate the health and safety concerns of the event which in recent years has drawn upwards of 30,000 people for the one-day event. Hence it was decided to host Kala Pola virtually this year as a month-long event from February 21 to March 21.Kala Pola 2021 is hosted within www.srilankanartgallery.com, a platform previously developed by John Keells Foundation (the CSR entity of the John Keells Group) to supplement the traditionally one-day Kala Pola event, by creating a space for Sri Lankan artists to display their work on a digital platform throughout the year. Kala Pola 2021 also welcomed Nations Trust (NTB) as its Banking Partner and hosted NTB’s Private Banking customers to a preview of the online event on 20th February, one-day prior to opening for the public.The online format echoes the physical format with the website putting the artist and buyer in contact to discuss, understand and negotiate individual transactions.The online event has also opened up a global platform for the event, enabling Sri Lankan artists residing overseas to enter their work while allowing buyers overseas to contact the artists and make direct purchases.John Keells Foundation has also organized four fringe events to be featured during the online event to better engage collectors, artists, kids and art lovers as a whole.The features are `A Collector’s Guide - Start and build your own Art collection’, two panel discussions on ‘Digital Transformation in the Art Industry’ and `Do Artists have a Place?’ featuring art experts and senior artists respectively and a workshop for kids on leaf painting and clay making with the Cora Abraham Art school, all of which will be streamed live on the Kala Pola Facebook page.The key objective of Kala Pola for the organizers – the George Keyt Foundation and the John Keells Group – is to develop sustainable livelihoods for Sri Lankan artists, build learning and networking opportunities available to artists and to enhance knowledge and appreciation for original art within the public. Over the past 27 years Kala Pola has enabled artists to build a steady clientele beyond the immediate sales during the event and has created sustainable market opportunities over time.While the event also facilitates learning and interaction among artists it has also become a reputed means of popularizing the appreciation and patronizing of visual art by the general public over the years.At a time when many local artists have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, The George Keyt Foundation together with the John Keells Group remain committed to supporting and promoting Sri Lankan artists and hope that the online edition will further these objectives by showcasing the work of local artists to an international audience during the month long event.Arts and Culture is one of the six focus areas of John Keells Foundation- the CSR entity of John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH), a company listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange operating over 70 companies in 7 diverse industry sectors."
21 June 2020,   Public money to revive the private sector,"With the Covid-19 scare gradually diminishing at least for the present in Sri Lanka, everyone is focusing on private sector business revival to rebuild the economy and public entities getting back in full swing to facilitate growth.Governments across the world have extended various forms of financial help to private entities to stay afloat to start with and then to lay the foundation for fast recovery.Sri Lanka is no exception. Most facilities extended to all levels of private business entities are funded by public money – some direct and some indirect but yet, public funds.The government has to borrow more to support this process on top of funds needed for capital and recurrent expenditure. Therefore, business organisations have an obligation to use the money wisely. If you have been criticising the government for waste, losses and inefficiency, here is the opportunity, as the private sector to demonstrate the difference.Of course, a common complaint is that what has been done is not adequate. Therefore, more government intervention is needed. We see this not only with Covid 19 but also when the Easter attacks took place. Will there be, therefore, a greater scrutiny of private businesses by the government to safeguard public funds?Some countries have pumped trillions of dollars into their economies directly and have also cut interest rates and applied other forms of monetary stimulus. As governments step up to serve, or save the private sector, the means they choose will differ. How much, how fast, and in what ways will governments eventually reduce their economic role will be some of the most important questions during the next few years.For us, the Easter attack made the economy suffer and within months and another calamity of the highest impact has now put unprecedented pressure on the government. Isn’t too much to ask a government that was already badly hit –  to compensate for the Covid-19 related losses. The Government is asked even to pay the salaries of employees in some sectors. Extend concessionary loans to pay salaries and defer bank commitments and various other forms of grants and facilities.Public funds for public interestWith many businesses likely to operate with public money to some extent, the public will expect — indeed, demand — that their money be used for the benefit of society at large. But with citizens potentially facing higher taxes or fewer services or both to pay for the stimulus, this pressure will likely not ease in the near future. This raises complicated questions. What does it mean for businesses to do right by their employees and customers?During the peak and high risk Covid-19 environment several weeks ago, the expectation was that we will see the rise of a contact-free economy in Sri Lanka. In three areas in particular — digital commerce, telemedicine, and automation — the Covid-19 pandemic has proved to be a decisive turning point for most of us as professionals and customers.However, we already see a majority of business activities reverting to the old practices. Customer habit change has been short lived and new business practices have subsided to a large extent. Is this due to the fact that most businesses have found it difficult to compete with new norms?A few weeks ago, it was becoming possible to imagine a world of business — from the factory to the shop floor — in which human contact was minimised. But not eliminated. Getting back to normal will include popping into stores again, and many patients will still want to chat with their doctors in person. Yet, the trends are unmistakable. Businesses may need to reallocate investment — for example, hospitals might offer telemedicine and clinic visit options — and rethink their strategic plans to take them into account.A more resilient private sectorCompanies will need to reconsider how they can gain and sustain more resilience. Companies will have to rethink, not tweak, their business models. One big area that’s likely to change dramatically is the supply chain.Supply chains built on just-in-time inventory and distributed component sourcing may well have to be reconsidered, given the way many have been disrupted. Many companies will need to rebalance their priorities, making additional resiliency measures as important to their strategic thinking as cost and efficiency.Because necessity is often the mother of invention, the pandemic could bring some positive outcomes. Individuals, communities, businesses, and governments are all learning new ways to connect.And businesses are finding faster, cheaper ways to operate. In-person conferences have gone virtual but that future is yet to be seen. Remote working has soared but will it stay that way?These changes could make for better management and more flexible workforces. Business organisations need to decide what they want to hold on to and what to let go off based on merits and demerits of the forced practices – cost and competitive advantage need to be weighed for decision making.Whatever it is, the private sector whose setbacks are partially sponsored by public funds have an additional obligation to the public. Ironically, its public money for private sector revival – so the private sector should keep public interest and its well-being as a priority. Self reliance of the private sector must be on top of the list of the government and the private sector be better able to face any future calamities and look for public sponsorship as the last resort.Nurturing a next normal that will be better than what it replaced will be a long-term test for all institutions, global and local, public and private. For all of us, instead of looking to the past, it will be critical to reconstruct for the future."
29 March 2020,Corona and business   ,"The rapid outbreak of the coronavirus presents multiple issues which the world is grappling with. Almost all social and economic activities have come to a standstill. There is also a significant commercial impact being felt globally with the worst yet to come. As viruses know no borders, its impact will continue to spread.  Pandemic and its negative impact on business is a humongous challenge for employers having to balance many critical aspects of business ensuring continuity of operations for survival and sustainability. It’s a nightmare from a supply chain perspective which has already paralysed the whole world.PrioritiesSafety first - Identify possible work-related exposure and health risks to your employees. Review human resources policies to make sure that policies and practices are consistent with public health recommendations and are consistent with regulations and policies. Business next - Re-visit your strategy and action plan with the team and come up with a flexible and evolving plan of action to deal with volatility until the issue fades away and the environment becomes reasonably predictable at least in the short term. Identify essential business functions, essential jobs or roles, and critical elements within your supply chains such as raw materials, suppliers, subcontractor services/products, and logistics needed to maintain business operations. Plan for how your business will operate if there is increasing absenteeism or if supply chains are interrupted. Communicate - Share your plan with employees and explain what human resources policies, workplace and leave flexibilities, working from home as an alternative possibility and pay and welfare benefits available to them. Share best practices with other businesses in your industry and business segment to learn from others. The unexpected  Set up authorities, triggers and procedures for activating and terminating the company’s infectious disease outbreak response plan, altering business operations such as possibly changing or closing operations in affected areas and transferring business knowledge to key employees. Set up a process to communicate information to employees and business partners on your infectious disease outbreak response plans and the latest COVID-19 information. Anticipate employee fear, anxiety, rumours and misinformation and plan communications accordingly. The bigger employers have a further part to play. Global epidemic preparedness and response is underfunded. While the rich world can afford Covid-19 interventions, the global spread of the virus in less than three months has demonstrated how international health is as strong as the weakest and poorest health system. There are no drugs or vaccines against Covid-19, and research to deliver them needs funding too. Sizeable financial contributions are needed not only from high-income governments from philanthropy and from global, financial institutions such as the World Bank, but also from business. Far-sighted companies should see this as a shrewd investment. The tens of billions of dollars the world needs to respond to Covid-19 are nothing compared to the trillions wiped from stock exchanges last week. Customers and employees increasingly expect businesses to play a big part in supporting global public goods and to look beyond the interests of shareholders. There’s no need to invoke concepts of social purpose or stakeholder capitalism here. This crisis is a threat to shareholders, no less than it is to wider society. You need to position your business to be resilient in the face of this and the next global threat.  "
9 February 2020,John Keells reports 2% revenue growth in 3Q,"The Transportation, Consumer Foods, Retail and Financial Services groups recorded growth in profits.The Group’s year-on-year performance for the quarter was impacted by the downturn in the Group’s Sri Lankan leisure business which continued to be impacted after the Easter Sunday terror attacks, exchange losses recorded at the Holding Company on its foreign currency denominated cash holdings compared to the significant exchange gains recorded in the previous year and lower income as a result of the deployment of cash in new investments.Consumer Foods witnessed growth.JKH declared a second interim dividend of Rs.1.50 per share, to be paid on February 19.John Keells Holdings PLC reported a 2 per cent growth in Group revenue during the third quarter of the year of Rs.37.46 billion. Transportation, Consumer Foods, Retail and Financial Services industry groups recorded a growth in profits although overall Group performance was impacted by the Sri Lankan Leisure business and exchange losses at the Holding Company.The underlying performance of the Group is depicted after adjusting for the new Accounting standard SLFRS 16 which came to effect this year, for easier comparison. Accordingly, EBITDA in 2018/19 is comparatively adjusted for the impact of SLFRS 16, on a like-with-like basis against the EBITDA in 2019/20 (adjusted EBITDA).The Group’s Bunkering business, Lanka Marine Services (LMS), recorded a strong growth in profits. The Transportation industry group EBITDA of Rs.1.29 billion in Q3 of 2019/20 was a 8 per cent increase over the adjusted EBITDA of Rs.1.19 billion for the third quarter of 2018/19.The Consumer Foods industry group EBITDA of Rs.722 million for Q3 of FY2019/20 was a 21 per cent increase over the adjusted EBITDA of Rs.598 million for the third quarter of 2018/19. Both the Beverage and the Frozen Confectionery businesses recorded an improvement in performance driven by volume growth and a better sales mix.The retail industry group recorded a revenue growth of 18 per cent which was driven by a strong performance in the Supermarkets business, driven by a notable contribution from new outlets and strong growth in customer footfall. Retail recorded an EBITDA of Rs.1.59 billion compared with the adjusted EBITDA of Rs.766 million in the same period last year. Seven new outlets were opened during the quarter, increasing the total store count to 107 as at December 31, 2019.EBITDA for the third quarter of 2019/20 was Rs.656 million, compared to the Rs.1.34 billion (adjusted) recorded in Q3 2018/19.The newly reconstructed 159-room Cinnamon Bentota Beach commenced operations in January 2020.The Financial Services industry group EBITDA of Rs.1.16 billion for Q3 of FY2019/20 was a 11 per cent increase over the adjusted EBITDA of Rs.1.05 billion for the third quarter of 2018/19. Nations Trust Bank PLC recorded a strong improvement in profitability. The performance of Union Assurance PLC improved driven by a growth in gross written premiums.Other, Including Information Technology and Plantation Services sectors recorded an EBITDA of Rs.151 million in the third quarter of 2019/20 over the adjusted EBITDA of Rs. 2.44 billion for the third quarter of 2018/19. The decrease in profitability is mainly attributable to the exchange losses recorded in the third quarter of 2019/20. Profitability was also impacted by the on-going deployment of equity into the Cinnamon Life project which resulted in a year-on-year decrease in income."
11 July 2021,"Service excellence, vital in business","It is a known and widely accepted factor in business circles that great service delivery is one of the most important assets for every organisation regardless of the size. Hence, the difference between an excellent, mediocre, or poor service to the customer is one of the deciding factors in the success or failure of a business. The subject is so important; business leaders confer undivided attention and focus on service quality in their respective ventures. It is understood that every person in the workforce must continuously add value for the customer’s experience after a product is sold to them.  With the easily available market information, customers are more demanding on service factors in today’s business environment. They need the whole package from the beginning to the end.   The competitive advantage created through the service attributes makes a key differentiator in the current fiercely competitive market. Organisations are therefore forced to offer service levels above the standard norms. It was revealed that over 70% of customers would share their satisfying experience with an average of six outsiders. Similarly, the vast majority of customers consider word-of-mouth as the best and the most credible reference they can obtain about a product, service, or business. In reality, the impact of word-of-mouth marketing can supersede any number of advertisements or other marketing campaigns due to the personal engagement and experience of the customer with the service of an organisation.   The practice of most small and medium businesses is to provide the maximum attention to the customer before the purchase. Companies spend substantial amounts of money to train sales staff members and teach them how nice and polite one should be to convert a prospect to a customer. Customer serviceHowever, most often companies conveniently turn a blind eye to training staff on customer service, perhaps due to a lack of understanding about the adverse effects of poor service. Regrettably, the most common experience in Sri Lanka with most of the small organisations is that the service after the purchase is less than mediocre. However, most large-scale organisations offer better service quality where they educate the overall staff on customer service.  However, ultimately, the rise in service competition and rivalry indicates that all organisations should take a service perspective when formulating competitive strategies and value propositions. Particularly, businesses such as hotels, restaurants, banks, supermarkets, and facility services should consider more on the value proposition related to service superiority in their strategies. Service to customers consists of tangible and intangible aspects. For example, physical features of a restaurant such as interior arrangements, furniture, live music and menus are tangible elements whereas the courteous behaviour of the staff, friendliness and speed of delivery are intangible aspects. Similarly, the cleanliness of a hotel room can be measured physically and objectively but the effectiveness of the service is subjective and difficult to measure.    There are many levels of service quality; excellent, good, average, and poor. Any organisation falls into one of these categories. In today’s market, companies are struggling to minimise customer complaints and to avoid calls to the help desk by delivering the best possible customer service. There is no magical formula for providing excellent service. In my long career in business, I have realised that it ultimately is the attitude of the deliverer. No matter how much a company spends to train the staff even with the best available trainers, one disgruntled employee with a bad attitude can drive a customer away forever. Attempting to create rules and regulations or describe ways to manage customers is effective only as long as the attitude of the staff member is sensible towards the customer.   What is excellence? Service is the extent that makes the customer feel satisfied compared to the level of expectation. Excellent service is to go beyond the level of expectation that surpasses the average satisfaction. This happens when the customer feels that they have received an unexpectedly good service reception. This extra can be simple acts such as a smile, a positive remark, an act of kindness, or even extra attention. However, the staff has to be educated that a simple mistake or an unwarranted act can spoil a perfectly delivered service effort.For example, even when an employee gives maximum attention to a customer, if he or she answers an outside telephone call, the customer can get irritated and blow away all that had already been done.   Customers evaluate the service quality by comparing the service offered by the provider and their perception of what they think it would be. This is the basic psychology of customers. A good organisation understands this principle and strategises its service quality on this. Therefore, the consumer needs of a  business have to be evaluated by the decision-makers and delivered to customers through the staff that understands the importance of such needs.   LoyaltyExperienced and successful business leaders know that customer loyalty has a direct influence on the financial result of their organisations. Apart from customer retention, they understand that loyalty can increase the profits of the organisation. The service quality generates a direct impact on revenue as customers become flexible and lenient, and favourable even in a bad situation.On the contrary, bad service rendered to customers makes them move away from the organisation for good. This is the reason for the famous quote ‘If you don’t look after your customers, your competitors will’ is accepted as serious in businessThere are reasons why organisations cannot afford to ignore good service quality any longer. A poor or mediocre service offered can result in the loss of a loyal customer. It can obstruct word-of-mouth marketing that is one of the best methods of promoting a business or brand. Attracting new customers is a long and tedious procedure that costs money and bad service can prevent this important process.The damage to the image of an organisation due to poor service can last forever and the impression communicated to others by an irritated customer can be immensely destructive. In such a situation, an organisation can suffer losses, financial and non-financial. The factors discussed above on service excellence clearly indicate the losses or gains an organisation can suffer or achieve in the long run. However, the pertinent question is whether the expenditure incurred on training staff is less than the benefits by offering a better service delivery through trained staff. The answer from this writer’s personal experience and much research conducted around the world is a firm affirmative. The gains and benefits for the business compared to the cost of training can be enormously high in financial and non-financial aspects. AttitudeAs discussed earlier in this article, the most important aspect of service excellence is employee attitude. Irrespective of the strategies, expenditure, training, and other inputs, it is ultimately the staff of the organisation that practically delivers it to the customer.Hence, motivating employees appropriately and constantly monitoring the delivery levels are the key elements of the service quality of an organisation.  It is also important to involve and engage employees in deciding strategies for customer service.  In conclusion, achieving excellence in service and earning customer appreciation is not difficult by any means. However, genuine commitment and focus from top to bottom of the organisation with the right decisions are required to achieve the best in service from the customer’s perspective.

16 August 2020,"Focus on efficiency, vital to combat Covid-19 business challenge","While the risk of Covid-19 remains high, with great progress made as a country, you scratch your head and ponder on how to regain the lost momentum and get back on track fully. Full market recovery will take more time than you think. So driving internal efficiency is a must to remain in business for medium to long term growth.Many companies laid off people and reduced salaries and perks as a quick measure to reduce costs to stay afloat.It’s high time to look at the efficiency of people you have decided to keep and the business value of each activity you perform.All organisations do some work that is unnecessary. This work wastes resources that you could use more effectively to add more value.High value added work is often rewarding and is profitable to the organisation.What are the activities you have been doing that do not produce the right results in the new normal world with many external factors dramatically changing?Work practices, tools, policies and even processes that you developed to serve a specific purpose at a given point in time may become less relevant and effective as your operating environment changes. Given enough change, they can actually stop adding value at all, while continuing to drain resources as people continue to “go through the motions” because “we have always done it.”By eliminating low value activities, you have time to improve the way you do things. Otherwise, day-to-day pressures will prevent you from using your time to think and plan for progress. This happens almost everywhere.Organisations have habits tooOrganisations get into habits just like people. People then defend the habits as though they made sense. The habits probably did make sense once but things have moved on. They result in vast amounts of wasted effort.“I know it doesn’t make sense but we have always done it this way.” If you ask people to suggest to their manager their ideas for doing things better, they nearly always resist.The organisation has another habit, which is to discourage staff from expressing their ideas by not being prepared to listen to them.You can deal with this by deliberately listening to staff and acknowledging their ideas and creativity. You can avoid too much upward delegation by encouraging the staff to carry out their own ideas.Most people like to feel that their work is useful.You may find that some of the work you do is unnecessary. If you get information or work from someone else that you do not require, you could tell them so, gently.It’s probably understandable that when we think of “being better” and “doing more,” our thoughts go first to needing and getting more resources, more capacity — a bigger budget, more staff.But from our experience, there’s almost always the opportunity, first, to better optimise existing resources by routinely ridding your company’s ‘garage’ of what mattered yesterday, so you can re-focus those resources onto what matters today.Think of it as doing more with what you’ve already got — to the great benefit of your company’s bottom line.Re-scanIf people don’t know what happens to their work, then it is hard to make precise judgements about what to do.If you know that the work you do will determine if a product gets to a customer today, tomorrow or not at all, then this is motivating; you see the fruits of your work.When you know the context of your work, you can decide what to do and what to drop. You could encourage people to trace their work across the organisation.The assumptions that people make, strongly influence the work they do. Most managers in the organisation may have a common assumption. For example, they may have the assumption that you cannot influence a tedious and bureaucratic system that is imposed on the organisation from outside.The work reduction caused by a small change might be very large. If you simply accept the assumption without rigorously testing it, then the unnecessary work will continue indefinitely. People make assumptions too. Someone might assume that he or she has to go on doing the work in a particular way. “We have always done it like this. My manager wouldn’t agree to any shortcuts so there is no point in asking him.”Assumptions are a cultural issue. Individual managers could encourage their staff to question assumptions by asking for and listening to their radical ideas. “If this was your section or department or organisation, what would you have us do differently?” You could make improvements in the way you and your team work routinely. This is part of the job of all managers.LeanWhen people find the culture of their organisation too critical, they work defensively to avoid people criticising them or catching them out. They may even make work they do appear to be useful. If organisations are too ‘lean’ there is no time to review the effectiveness of systems and improve or eliminate them.Paradoxically, the leanness of resources causes wasted effort. Effective organisations need some slack to allow time to improve. Managers, who are under stress and time pressure, find it very difficult to listen to ideas on how the organisation could do things better.They may find it hard to hear anything from their staff. This will block the flow of creative ideas from their staff. Then improvements to the way you do things get lost.The old patterns remain and you do unnecessary work. The ideal organisation would feel safe enough for people to talk openly about their mistakes without fear of reprisals. Managers and others would work together to learn from the mistake so that it was less likely to happen again in the future.Those who made no mistakes might, depending on their jobs, not be taking enough risks.So do away with bad business habits and bad habits of people which might give you more savings and business value than simply laying off people. Using your head (strategy) more than your body (action) at this time is paramount."

2 February 2020,Tea industry could ignite economic resurgence,"The tea industry must be looked at from a different perspective, as two distinct industries, tea growing/manufacturing and tea marketing, to make use of the opportunities rampant in the world consumer preferences and to meet such demands by producing quality controlled products at profitable and competitive levels.While the Plantation Ministry has the infrastructure to enforce good agricultural practices (GAP) and Good manufacturing practices (GMP) to ensure the quality of every kilo of tea produced, the EDB under the external trade ministry could be empowered to boost the global market share for tea.There are several natural products now in vogue as superfoods for their inherent health supportive properties. Virgin coconut oil, Coconut cream and Moringa are products exported from Sri Lanka to meet an increasing demand in the superfood category.Similarly, tea could be transformed into this category for its anti-carcinogenic property of ‘polyphenols’. Kombucha containing probiotics is another tea product on the superfood scale. With labeling identifying these properties backed by R&D, tea has the potential to be upgraded as a health supportive consumer product as opposed to the common thirst quencher.Disrupt instead of destructTea has not had the benefit of new technology due to industry leaders refusing to change. Disruption of archaic concepts and change from the Iron Age to Nano tech age is badly needed in the tea industry, if it is to make use of the opportunities available.Albert Einstein is widely credited with saying, “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.” Every sector in the tea industry needs disruption for shift in paradigms. This is commonly termed as thinking out of the box. Refusal to change will result in slow but sure destruction.For instance, tea smallholders can be empowered with new technology with education on economy of scale to run their small businesses as private cooperative units as the original model for sustainable family business has now changed with land fragmentation and increased cost of labour and other inputs.Private tea factories have proliferated with political patronage leading to malpractices. For an example, Kenya produces nearly 400 million kgs, in 160 factories, while Sri Lanka operates over 700 factories for the annual output of over 300 million kgs.Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) can be empowered and provided autonomy to diversify into other related fields, such as forestry, animal husbandry, special export crops, eco tourism etc. to spread the risk of investments and be profitable without subsidies.Exporters can be encouraged to expand the global reach with liberalisation of import export within controlled economic zones, lest there be ambiguity on the genuineness of the purpose.The financial structure involving loans for agriculture, manufacturing and exports must be reviewed for interest rates compatible with global standards. Most exporters are reeling under debt to banks and non receipt of export proceeds having to pay penalty interest to financial institutions. The P&M fund to the tune of 6 billion rupees contributed to by the tea exporters should be utilized to support exporters and none other. If needed, this fund could be used as a rotating fund to support brand building by exporters. For a workable strategy, all stakeholders must be consulted with their sector strategies for an expanded economic model in tea without banking on handouts and subsidies.The president has the desire to make Sri Lanka great having understood the potential our powerful island has to become an economic power base in the Indian Ocean.RationaleWhen a man from earth died and appeared at the “pearly gates”, Saint Peter the keeper of the gates accosted the man to find out what he was doing on earth to deserve a seat in heaven. The man most humbly answered, “St. Peter, back on earth I have been a tea trader all my life.” The gate promptly opened and St. Peter was heard to say, “Come in my son, take a harp, you have had enough of hell.”Though in a lighter vein, most in the tea trade engaged in the business of marketing tea feel the heat of hellfire, in a volatile business environment often interfered and manipulated by politicians to expand the vote base. This has been the case since the plantations were nationalised by Mrs. Sirimavo Bandarannaike in 1976. The once profitable and tax paying industry gradually declined to become one of the biggest liabilities to the tax paying public.An industry steeped in tradition and that has survived for over 150 years can be resurrected not with handouts, but only with sound business propositions based on the basic principle of market economy of supply and demand charged with innovation on the back of research and development.A vast majority of us in different segments of the industry feel the pain of no gain having dedicated our productive life to the cause of Ceylon tea, we are too passionate about.The magic of teaTea is a miracle crop and to harness the potential of tea is the business acumen. Imagine the British and Scottish planters coming by steamship back in the 18th century to clear jungles, uproot disease ridden coffee and plant tea as a commercial crop and being able to make good their investments.Sir Thomas J. Lipton made his fortunes in Ceylon and built the world’s largest tea brand Lipton. Even today when we travel in the tea country, we are amazed as to how the British rulers built the infrastructure, the winding roads cut into the mountain slopes, the railroads tunnelled through the mountains, built gigantic factories and the deployment of labour brought in from South India, all of which made Ceylon tea the most famous global beverage. It was the private enterprise which succeeded with patronisation and not with intervention by the State.Re-engineering teaWouldn’t it be prudent then to re-engineer this once glorious industry and turn it around to be self reliant on time tested principles and global demand for healthy beverages and superfoods. It is only then we could strategise the correct economic policy for our nation as professed by the government in building an export driven national economy.In 2002, when branding was recognised as the way forward in that year’s budget on a proposal put forward by the newly formed Tea Exporters Association (TEA), the export industry was elated and there was hope for expansion of tea exports with liberal trade policies. The momentum that gathered after the incentives offered backed by ‘Stable Policies’ for branding saw the tea export values climbing up gradually surpassing the $ 1 billion mark and reaching $ 1.6 billion by 2014.The tea industry was hopeful of going after a bigger target of USD 5 billion in tea exports by 2020 in support of the government’s ambitious drive to grow the total export revenue to 20 billion USD by 2020.US $ 5 billion was targeted with the possibility of taking a bigger share of the global consumer market, then estimated around $ 35 billion per annum. The formation of a strictly controlled import/export hub for value addition and branding to compete on par with major tea brands such as Lipton, Titley, and Twinings and product diversification into tea extracts and derivatives backed by research and development were taken into consideration.Although the government gazette of 1981 permitted the import of tea needed for blending and value addition, it lacked provisions for full liberalisation of the tea export industry. Hence the concept of a secluded hub was to ensure non-filtration of imported tea into the local supply chain to maintain the undiluted purity of Ceylon Tea.Currently the value of global consumerism on black and green tea exceeds 60 billion USD per annum and growing at a healthy percentage year on year.Status-quoComposition of the industry - From an overall position the tea industry comprises large plantations or RPCs, tea smallholders, private tea factory owners, tea brokers and the tea exporters. The tea smallholders or individual tea farmers play a big role in the supply chain producing 60% of the tea crop.Stagnation - But what do we witness today? A stagnant industry struggling to survive. The serious decline in the overall value of the entire tea industry be it growing, manufacturing or exporting is a matter for investigation as a first step towards re-igniting this once glorious national pride.Decline in quality - It is the general perception that Ceylon tea is the best in the world, but unfortunately all teas produced in Sri Lanka do not fall within the finest quality stamped with a LION logo by the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB). At the best 40% of the teas manufactured in the country qualify for the LION logo certification whilst the rest are comparable with teas from other origins.Constricted supply chain - The production of tea is declining due to a multitude of reasons with very little hope of Sri Lanka’s tea crop to exceed 380 million kgs when the world tea production is increasing annually at an average of 6.5%. Our share of the global tea export trade has declined from 18% in 2010 to 12% in 2018 and will continue to decline, year on year making the supply chain constricted due to stagnant tea output.Tea smallholder - The smallholder farmers who manufacture 60% of the tea crop rely heavily on government subsidies for fertiliser, planting materials and demand a guaranteed price for fresh leaf. The economic model of the smallholder tea farmers is non viable due to land fragmentation and the high cost manual operations with hired labour as opposed to self tending. Unless the operational model is rehashed with new technology being infused and increase the economy of scale under a cooperative model for shared labour, it will continue to suffer economic stress and rely heavily on the ex-checker.The current subsidies paid out to the smallholder farmers could be invested in developing a productive economic model for prosperity and arrest further fragmentation.The tea smallholder concept was a clever strategy adopted after the JVP instigated youth uprising in the 1970s, to gainfully engage the households in several poor regions by luring them into tea cultivation in home plots with government subsidies. Whilst it solved the problem of unemployment by transforming many thousands to self-employment in the early 80s the expansion in the family unit has resulted in fragmentation of land in the present time and the operational costs exceeding income.RPCs - Large plantations classified under Regional Plantation Companies (RPC’s) regularly complain of difficulties in meeting the demands of politicised unions for increase in wages unrelated to productivity. Due to wages not being linked to productivity, cost of production (COP) in Sri Lanka is identified as the highest in the tea world.The RPCs are also governed by restrictions imposed by the state (the golden shareholder) on activities outside of tea. If the plantations are allowed to diversify their business model to multi crops, forestry, animal husbandry and eco-tourism whilst adhering to modern growing and manufacturing practices for cost effective production, the plantation economy would surge from the present levels.Private tea factories - The proliferation in private tea factories in violation of laid down regulations has caused severe damage to the quality of tea. The problems created by unscrupulous factories in adulteration using sugar and other substances has resulted in Ceylon tea being strictly monitored for MRLs by several importing countries.Tea economyDeveloped countries are already using tea as an industrial base material for a multitude of high end products in many different consumer segments.Tea is the number one beverage in the world which is natural, affordable and free from any allergies, safe to drink at any age or any stage, even during pregnancy.Global tea economy - Tea is the earliest beverage in the world discovered in China many centuries ago. Today it is consumed in every nook and corner of the world for its therapeutic value as an all day rehydrating drink. Apart from tea being consumed as a hot beverage, tea is used as an ingredient in the following segments.1 Iced teas & tea based soft drinks2 Pharmaceuticals such as polyphenols3 Fragrance and non beverage applications as skincare products.4 Solid foods such as tea cookies and tea pestos, tea salads.5 Green tea powder as a superfood in milkshakes and in cooking.If an assessment is to be carried out for all segments of this super commodity a value close to 100 billion USD could be attributed at current consumer levels. One of the most exciting factors is the rediscovery of tea for its hidden therapeutic values driving the youth across the globe towards tea which was earlier a drink of the elderly.If the government is serious about the tea economy, they should free the industry from state intervention and political interference and allow the industry to operate as a business. Tea is rich with tradition and these traditions could be transformed into trends for greater benefit of the industry at large. All that the industry needs are policies based on market economy, a tax regime supporting competitive exports and autonomy for the export industry.World tea production is ever increasing due to demand, especially in China and India to meet internal consumption and is targeted to reach 6 billion kgs.World tea export volume has exceeded 1.8 billion kgs out of tea producing countries and tea HUBs and continue to increase, whereas the global “retail” market for tea as a hot beverage is close to 60 billion USDTea, Apart from being used as a hot beverage, iced tea in ready to drink form is making vast strides in the beverage sector. Tea is also a base for several non beverage products used in pharma, wellness and even as a safe alternative to kick the habit of smoking.Sri Lanka has the most advanced tea packaging factories amongst the tea producing countries but has raw material limitation of 350 million kgs or 6.3% of the world productionThe question now is, should we be big fish in a small pond or small fish in a big pond? Bigger the pond room to grow.At a time when the new President has voiced his desire through his well documented manifesto to make Sri Lanka a prosperous nation, It may be worth looking at the following fundamentals in social economic justice for Nation building.Tea strategyThe dynamics of the industry - There are two very specific and inter connected sectors in the tea industry, tea growing/manufacturing and tea exports. These two segments have to be separately identified and brought under specific ministries for a result driven export economy. Unlike in the past where the plantations were directly linked to the export-houses in Colombo, nationalisation of the estates caused to segregate plantations and exports. Though the exporters are not asking for handouts, several sectors in the tea industry are under severe stress due to veering off the commercial path and relying heavily on political patronage the industry has got used to over the years. Weaning these sectors off such unrealistic economic models is the biggest challenge for the government in power.Taking a bold step to convert the entire industry to a self reliant model based on the economic principle of supply and demand should be the target with timelines set for achieving. We must not forget that tea was an industry not relying on the state but contributed to the exchequer before the nationalization of the plantation industry.Hence it will not be a Herculean task to make tea a profitable industry once again to contribute to and not beg for assistance from the state.Segregation of the industry on the different strengths of plantations for manufacturing and exports for value addition with branding as consumer ready products would truly expose the strengths and weaknesses to strategize productive measures for the entire tea industry.The liberalisation of the tea export industry has been a moot point for several decades and due to political connotations and objections from groups with vested interest never saw the light of day. The tea HUB or the special economic zone was proposed to carve out a larger portion of the global tea market, through value addition of teas from all origins. Though it was accepted in principle and even approved by lawmakers the implementation never took place. It was even considered by the Ministry of Finance to start the process under a controlled scheme based on the statutes gazetted in 1981.One other proposal by TEA was for a change in the way tea is procured. An electronic auction system similar to a commodity exchange. This would cut down the procuring time by a big margin and make the process more transparent, efficient and free of malpractices. A once thriving industry which paid all statutory taxes to the government became a debtor to the nation after the estates and agency houses were nationalised in 1975. Subsequent reversal with government control has not paid the desired results and continues as a burden.The socialist economic policies of successive governments to placate the voters have resulted in uneconomic repercussions and it is not easy to turn around from a state of welfare to that of a hardworking nation without the political will to do so.1 You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity2 What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving?3 The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.4 You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it5 When half the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation.The writer is SLT Chairman and a Past President of the National Chamber of Exporters and a Past Chairman the Tea Exporters Association****Sri Lanka tea economy* Exports - 300 to 340 million kgs per annum generating 1.6 billion USD or thereabouts.* Value addition, consumer ready (real term) around 40% of total exports.* Exports under local brands are not more than 20% of total exports.* Genuine Ceylon Tea as recognised by the Lion logo certification - not more than 40% of the total annual production or 130 million kgs* Almost 60% of the annual production is non-competitive at global level due to the high cost of labour and closed door economic policy for tea.* Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) vastly disregarded making the renowned quality of Ceylon tea questionable.* BMFannings can be profitably used as a raw material in the extraction of tea properties for several tea based derivatives.

21 March 2021,"Pruning consumption, borrowings from CB, commercial banks, the way forward -Former senior Central Banker","Money creation could have been avoided had the Government pruned consumption expenditure, stopped borrowings from the Central Bank and commercial banks and promoted revenue earnings from exports and foreign direct investments, said a  former senior  Central Banker.Money creation could have been avoided had the Government increased its revenue base, pruned expenditure, specifically its consumption expenditure and borrowing from the people instead of borrowing from the Central Bank and commercial banks,” former Central Bank Deputy Governor Dr. W.A. Wijewardena said. He said to repay foreign debt immediately, Sri Lanka has no choice other than borrow more from the international markets and in the long run by increasing its foreign exchange earnings via the export of goods and services, attracting remittances and Foreign Direct Investments over and above the country's foreign exchange payments. “Resorting to the IMF for support is not a substitute for money creation because it is given to the Central Bank to wade through the shortage of foreign exchange in the market,” Dr. Wijewardena said, adding that money printing  is neither the last nor the first resort but something being done by modern governments which issue paper money based on fractional reserves held by their central banks.  “What we mean by fractional reserves is that unlike in thegood old days where money was supported by 100% backing of either gold or foreign exchange reserves, modern Central Banks keep only a minimum amount of such reserves when they issue new money called Reserve Money or Base Money; but what should concern the public is not this reserve money created by a Central Bank but the total money in the hands of the public made up of the currency issued by the Central Bank and demand, time and savings accounts held by people in commercial banks.It is this stock of money that chases after goods and services and causes inflation if it is oversupplied. “In Sri Lanka, this stock as at end of 2019 amounted to Rs. 7,624 billion but  increased to Rs. 9,532 billion in January 2021. The increase is Rs. 1,908 billion or 25% during the past 11 months. “This was needed to provide the funding to the Covid-19 affected economy but with the current low interest rates, this can cause high inflation in the future,” the former Senior Central Banker said, adding that the gravity of the problem has been that this has been caused by the borrowings of the Government from the Central Bank and commercial banks by Rs. 2,416 billion, much more than the increase in the money supply. The difference has simply gone out of Sri Lanka exerting pressure on the rupee to depreciate in the international markets.On the impact of the downgrading of the sovereign ratings by rating bodies on non-debt creating inflows and FDI promotion, Dr. Wijewardena said the country downgrade does not affect the promotion of non-debt investments; they are determined principally whether the country would maintain a proper macroeconomic balance, easy environment for investors to invest their money, observance of rule of law and maintenance of law and order through independent law enforcers like the Police, court system and the Attorney General.These cannot be established immediately but a firm commitment to them expressed presently and followed vigorously with a time bound action plan will surely help Sri Lanka to attract such investments."

29 August 2021,People skills in sales management,"Former American President Theodore Roosevelt Jr. once said, “The most important single ingredient in the formula for success is the knack of getting along with people”. This is an extremely pragmatic and realistic statement in business and life. The Cambridge English Dictionary defines people skill as the ability to communicate with people in a friendly way and therefore deal with them effectively, especially in business. Meanwhile, Wikipedia describes it as an umbrella term for skills under three specific sets of abilities: personal effectiveness, interaction skills, and intercession (the action of intervening on behalf of others). Although people skills are useful and important in other business activities, it is compulsory and perhaps the most important trait a sales manager should possess. If the sales manager does not communicate, empathise, and represent his or her staff genuinely and honestly, the repercussion or reciprocation can be detrimental to the job as a leader. If you wish to be a sales manager, make sure that you have experience in personal selling, skills, drive, and a good track record. The management skills of the superiors picked up by observing them are one sure way to gather knowledge in the management of a sales team. Therefore, mere success in only selling skills or sales close rate as a practitioner is inadequate to be a successful sales manager. The ability to lead, motivate and elevate others to achieve more under you is the key factor in your success. Whilst sales managers essentially need hands-on experience in sales, there are other equally important skills and mission-critical functions in order to excel. The first and foremost among them is people skills. ‘Power’Simply appointing you as the sales manager by an organisation gives you ‘legitimate power’ to lead the team. With the designation, most often a sales manager automatically is entitled to apply ‘reward power’ that allows him to reward the subordinates and ‘coercive power’ where he can punish them if or when necessary.  However, the more important two aspects are the ‘expert power’ where you can offer credible advice based on your own experience and knowledge, and the ‘referent power’ where the sales manager acts as a mentor to the team to attract positive attitude of the subordinates towards him as a leader. Nevertheless, the most salient factor in sales leadership is to strike a balance between all these leadership powers by practicing effective people skills. As stated by Roosevelt Jr., the ultimatum and the most important ingredient in sales success is the people skill the sales manager applies to his or her team. In people management, the first and foremost is the mutual trust built between the leader and his followers. As I have said numerous times previously, in reality, successful salesmen are always an independent, smart, and vigorous fraternity who act on their own whether they are right or wrong. Correct pathTherefore, the sales manager has to monitor them subtly with whatever controls available to him to keep them on the correct path. When the team members start trusting the leadership, they feel secure and free to exchange information openly. Hence, building mutual trust with your subordinates genuinely is one of the most important tasks in people management.   When you convince the sales team that you can be trusted and you will protect them in a difficult situation, they will individually take over the ownership of their actions. The sales staff members will only approach you only when they have a genuine requirement. This can make you more efficient in management where you will save more time for other functions within your purview. Effective personal communication is also an exceptionally vital element in people skills related to sales team management. The sales manager’s ability to understand and empathize with his team makes him interact with them effectively and build up a rapport. Effective communication of a leader not only builds up trust and sincerity but also helps to avoid conflicts and reach consensus easily with the team members. The ability to communicate is essential in any field of endeavour. However, when managing a sales team, the sales manager must learn to communicate in a special language to understand the staff individually and as a team well enough to empathize with them. Dialogues with the staff must be effective and efficient in business situations and cordial and empathetic in personal conversations.HecticMoney talks in many situations. However, money talk will not buy you a motivated sales team. It is deeper than numbers. Selling is hectic. Salesmen work under pressure, from both the customer and the company, and often work under difficult conditions. Therefore, a good sales manager keeps his team constantly happy by igniting inner desires, letting them have fun, lavishly praising them in victory, and encouraging them in failures.  Sales managers frequently use various tactics to motivate the team under them to be in the race. Particularly, in today’s fiercely competitive market conditions, it is exceedingly important to keep them on alert in the market. Hence, a deeper meaning to the job function must be given by guiding them to understand the salesman’s role in the organization and how important it is to the organization as a whole.The true motivation for a salesman comes from the notion that they are the most valuable asset in the company. The sales manager must constantly drive this idea to them.  Recognition of initiatives is a good motivator for salespeople. Giving the salespeople their freedom to make decisions, put forward new ideas, or introduce new systems can make them more encouraged. A good sales manager always persuades his team members to think like entrepreneurs who are looking forward to growth. The sales manager should not only give them ample space to try their new ideas but also reward them for such ideas.   MoraleA party is not essential to celebrate a win, whether big or small. Nevertheless, celebrating small wins boosts the morale of a sales team. In my career as a sales manager, I have conducted a brief meeting every morning with my sales staff at every organisation I was attached to. Through experience, I can guarantee that applause from the team to celebrate a closed sale is tremendously encouraging to the winner and gives him or her the extra mile to do better. There are many other strategies available to a sales manager to motivate his team. Therefore, building up a positive atmosphere through motivation is an important people-skill. The positivity of the leader is a compulsory people skill required to direct a sales team to success. Attitudes are contagious and the manager has to spread positive thinking throughout his team. The attitude of the sales manager is one of the most effective tools to boost up the team morale. The manager’s attitudes and actions can make a huge impact on the team. Therefore sales managers should always be enthusiastic, inspiring, and encouraging towards his or her team.  Finally, the leaders must be completely honest and genuine in their approach to the team. The sales manager’s feedback to the team members must be real and sincere.That builds a huge trust and bonding between the leader and the follower.As long as they look up to the leader for guidance, the team can be kept together for more results. An important people-skill is to show the team that the sales manager is with them in every difficulty and obstacle.   "
17 May 2020,Former CB Governor Cabraal spells out strategies to rebuild economy,"Former Central Bank Governor and Senior Economic Advisor to the Prime Minister Ajith Nivard Cabraal said four new strategies have been presented to rebuild the economy within a year, which has faced a setback due to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic in the country.The major tasks under these plans include: to obtain one to two years grace period to repay the loans (including interest) obtained from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), rebuild the production economy, save capital savings and strengthen the enterprises.Cabraal said the concession on loan repayment would prevent the outflow of US$ two billion so that the country can be strengthened without delay.The Senior Economic Advisor said steps should also be taken to prevent the outflow of money to foreign countries and allocate Rs.200 billion to the industrial sector and another Rs.200 billion for the people suffering from acute poverty which would eventually help uplift these sectors.He said, to strengthen the capital market, steps have already been taken to reopen the Stock Exchange. As yet another feature of our new strategies, steps will be taken to increase the production of all goods which can be made locally thereby strengthening the production economy and the local market. This would also help to circulate money among the people and expand market opportunities.Cabraal further said the tourism industry should be resumed based on the regulations and methodologies set out by the health authorities. These new endeavours, would help the country to recover from the present economic crisis and rebuild the economy within the next 6 to 12 months, he added."
14 May 2021,The role of ethics in modern marketing practices,"The Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court Potter Stewart once said, “Ethics is knowing the difference between what you have the right to do and what is right to do.” Ethics are a collection of sincere moral principles an organisation practices when engaged in business. Marketing ethics are being practiced by organisations by intentionally applying standards of fairness and honesty.  In a market economy, as that exists in Sri Lanka, businesses are expected to act in the best interest of their sustainability and growth. Therefore, to create a competitive advantage, marketing strategies are being used. The purpose is to make the customers aware that the company is doing better than its competitors in satisfying the needs of the clientele. Successful commercial organisations focus on adhering to ethical values rather than simply providing products or services for two key reasons. Primarily, it is tested and proven that when organisations behave ethically in the market, customers develop a positive impression toward the organisation, its products, or services. On the other hand, ignoring ethical standards can lead to mistrust, dissatisfaction, unfavorable publicity, and so forth. Hence, most commercial organisations treat marketing ethics as an extremely sensitive area in their respective businesses. Second, ethical misbehaviour leads to social pressure with greater demands on social responsibility. Professional associations and other consumer interest groups can exert influence on customers that can be damaging to the goodwill of a business. Hence, apart from the moral obligations, organisations are compelled to conform to the guidelines and related laws of regulatory authorities on consumer protection.  Successful organisations look at ethical marketing practices not only as a policy but also as a philosophy.  This includes everything from advertising campaigns to the final delivery of goods or services, to be honest, and trustworthy. The intention is to build a strong relationship with the clientele with a set of shared values. Organisations with an ethical marketing approach usually base their decisions on business strategies with an emphasis on moral values and obligations.  PhilosophyUnfair and deceptive practices, not only in marketing but also in other functions of the business, can influence customers to abandon the products and the company. Deception can take a form of misrepresentation, omission, and bad practice can take place in any element of the marketing mix. With the availability of a vast amount of information that can be accessed easily, the modern customers are knowledgeable and the probability of finding out an unethical practice by an organisation is high.  It is also common around the world that customers are often skeptical of marketing claims or selling messages. Often they look at those messages with some mistrust. Thus, if the message is deceptive or misleading, customers go elsewhere for their needs.  The use of offensive material in events, television programs, promotional material, or publications can create strong negative reactions in the market.  For example, if a television advertisement appears challenging cultural values, customs, or traditions, such advertisement can be perceived as offensive, and the possibility of rejection can be elevated in the well-informed Sri Lankan market. When people feel that the appeals are offensive and threatening to the values they believe in, they can move out of products and move in with competitors. For example, television channels break for advertisements during programs every fifteen minutes to announce the time. This is completely offensive to many viewers. Particularly, when this happens in the middle of an appealing program, a negative reaction about the advertiser and the product is inevitable. Nevertheless, marketers continue to stick to this unethical practice.  Being transparent whenever a product is released to the market is an exceedingly important function in ethical marketing practices. With the introduction of e-commerce, thousands of online marketers appeared in the marketplace. It is a big question whether these online stores offer adequate information about the products they sell online. Many customers have fallen victims to this mushroom online racket where they have received the wrong product after making payments through online payment gateways. HonestyGoods are marketed to satisfy customers in their literal sense. Therefore, committing to sustainability and protecting the rights of  customers is part of ethical marketing. Being honest in providing correct information without exaggeration is identified as a good marketing practice. Often customers come across products in the market with inadequate information on ingredients, composition, or components. Products are seen in the market with false comparisons with inaccurate and misleading claims about competitor’s products. In this writer’s opinion, with over forty years of experience in selling, it is a cinch that whether such statements are true or false, it can leave a bad imprint in the customer›s mind. Therefore, marketers should be extremely careful when they compare their products with those of their competitors. Comparison is a dangerous game and must be done only if it is unavoidable.  There are many products, particularly related to skincare and beauty products, without any scientific evidence to back up on quality and chemical composition. Products marketed for skin whitening are an example of a popular and fast-selling product with unverified claims. Now and then, news reports appear in the media where users have undergone adverse results after using such products. This is not only unethical but also a blatant violation of human privileges.   Organisations create strategies to obtain emotional reactions from customers as one of the most effective ways to create interest in a product. However, exploiting emotions such as fear, anger, and sadness in an unethical manner is bad practice. Generating response is important only when it is done without manipulating customers.  Bad habitsAn important marketing segment for certain products is children. In Sri Lanka, there are no regulatory authorities to monitor unethical marketing or advertising practices.  Whilst, some products target their marketing campaigns with a direct emphasis on children, some others address parents for certain product lines. For example, infant milk powder campaigns concentrate on parents whilst candy or fast food campaigns are directed at children as the target segment. Children are more susceptible to psychological influence and strong creative messages. Therefore, they are often exposed to questionable tactics if practiced with unethical strategies. Using children in unethical advertising is taking place in Sri Lanka. For example, a television advertisement showing a child licking fingers after taking food (finger licking is considered a bad habit in Sri Lankan society) can lead other children to follow the bad habit. This is identified as challenging the good cultural practices instilled for generations in Sri Lanka.  No living soul in the world likes to be misled, cheated, or deceived. If an unscrupulous marketer tries this practice, sooner or later, customers get to know that they had been taken for a ride. In this context, the marketer’s message can be varied from slightly exaggerated statements to blatant lies and everything in between. This is unethical marketing and it never succeeds in the long run.   Therefore, business entities must be aware of what they communicate to customers. If their strategies and practices are not sincere and unethical, customers may walk out. Customers can create more damage to the business, product, or brand if they talk to others about the negative acts. In this internet era, a Facebook post or a distasteful comment about the company or the product can go viral and generate a devastating chain reaction. Unethical marketing messages can destroy the reputation of a business instantly. Therefore, the key component is to be transparent and practice good ethics that have moral values. "
29 November 2020, Local turmeric to reach market in January,"The government is expecting the next yield of turmeric to reach the market early next year.Speaking to the Sunday Observer Trade Minister Bandula Gunawardena said the Government will announce the market price later. He said the Government is putting more emphasis on the farmers than the market itself.The Government banned the import of several products including turmeric in a bid to promote local production. In some parts of the island farmers were provided with seeds and fertilisers to grow the spice.Turmeric smugglingHowever, this also prompted people to smuggle turmeric from India. On Wednesday (25), the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) recovered a hidden stock of dried turmeric weighing 1,067 kg and apprehended a suspect, during a special search operation conducted in Puttalam.In a press release the SLN stated during this special operation carried out at the second mile post on the Puttalam-Mannar Road, the Northwestern Naval Command was able to find this stock of dried turmeric hidden at a salt manufacturing outlet in the area.The consignment of turmeric weighing 1,067kg had been stuffed in 25 sacks. A suspect from the fourth mile post in Rahuman Nagar was also held by Navy in connection with this incident.The suspect, a 37-year-old person, was handed over to the Puttalam Police for further legal action along with the recovered stock of dried turmeric, the SLN said.In a separate operation, on November 20, the SLN and the Police apprehended two suspects in the beach area of Erukkulampiddi in Mannar, and seized 710kg of smuggled dried turmeric and over three kg of Kerala cannabis.Apprehended wallam“Accordingly, the North Central Naval Command and Mannar Police were able to make this apprehension after searching a traditional wallam boat which arrived at the Erukkulampiddi beach area. The boat was loaded with over 710kg (wet weight) of dried turmeric in 10 sacks and over 03kg of (wet weight) of Kerala cannabis in a package. Two suspects who were on the wallam boat were also held by the Navy,” the SLN said. The accused of this racketeering were identified as residents of Erukkulampiddi area, aged 35.Those apprehended along with the ceased turmeric and Kerala cannabis stocks and boat were handed over to the Mannar police for legal action.The SLN has arrested over 70 people and apprehended over 30 tonnes of turmeric since the import ban was imposed. Most of the smuggled turmeric came from the sea route through India causing officials to conclude that the turmeric originated from the neighboring nation.Navy Spokesman Capt. Indika De Silva said the SLN has deployed more personnel on the beaches in the North Western part of the country.“We recently further strengthened the security in the area due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and also because turmeric is been smuggled through this area,” Capt. Silva said.The Sri Lanka Customs has also apprehended smuggled turmeric since its inclusion in the temporary suspension list. However, its spokesperson and Additional Director General Sunil Jayarathne said they are seeing a decrease in the incidents.Jayarathne said the customs caught about 500 kilos of turmeric concealed among other goods in an smuggling attempt.The forfeited turmeric was released to the Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation for the production of medicine.The Government is to re -ship 62 containers of turmeric, weighing about 100 metric tonnes, that were brought to Sri Lanka from India between May and June.PenaltyThe penalty for turmeric smuggling differs according to the circumstances. The goods are forfeited. The suspects may be remanded.Consumers complained the turmeric that is available in local shops are adulterated and could pose health threats. Some have started to grow their own turmeric t in their gardens.A shop owner who wished to remain anonymous, said in most cases turmeric is mixed with rice flour and dyed. “It is hard to say if it is mixed or pure turmeric until you buy it and use it in your food. It has happened before too but now we see more of it in the market,” he said.However, turmeric farmers are hopeful that their yield will soon stabilise the market demand. Speaking to the Sunday Observer, an agriculture researcher of a Govijana Seva Centre said more and more farmers are taking their assistance to grow turmeric. The Government is providing seeds and fertilisers to support local production.The researcher said that turmeric was not grown locally because the imported turmeric was much cheaper than the locally produced variety, and the farmers didn’t consider it as bringing economic benefits.Following the ban, a kilo of dried turmeric fetch a price of Rs. 6000, while early this year the price was around Rs. 400."

15 March 2020,Stock market: Brokers hope for sanity,"The Stock Market crashing last week was totally unwarranted resulting in a major loss to the equity market throughout the week, said market analysts.Past president of the Colombo Stock Brokers Association and Director/CEO Candor Group of Companies, Ravi Abeysuriya said last week’s events were unnecessary as the Sri Lankan market is not the US market which comprises a large number of investors.“There was no necessity to panic which was a big blow to the market, losing around Rs. 200 billion,” he said hoping that sanity will prevail among investors.JB Securities CEO Murtaza Jafferjee said Sri Lanka is following a global trend although it was not as the international markets run up precedent to the crash. This is an unprecedented time. Sri Lanka‘s equities have been down for around five years. Perhaps the level of correction should not be at the same magnitude.The CSE crashed last week following global slum with India down by 10 percent and USA 10 percent. The benchmark All Share Price Index recorded the second biggest drop of 4.14 percent or 221.24 points to close at 5,121.91 points.The market fell to an eight-year low on Monday resulting in the market closing for a cooling down for 30 minutes after the S & P SL20 index fell by 5%.

29 November 2020,Basic guidelines for youth entrepreneurs,"Last week we discussed entrepreneurship success. As a continuation, it is appropriate to provide a few basic guidelines to those interested in setting up a new business.Setting up a business venture, even on a small scale, entails the managing of many important issues. Among them are legal, finance, marketing, human resources, market feasibility, competition, and many other factors.There are plenty of success stories of start-ups that one can obtain inspiration from, in Sri Lanka and the world arena.At the outset, it is fundamentally vital to understand the challenges that lie ahead and the huge commitment needed to brave it. I can articulate with certainty that new entrepreneurs often fail due to a lack of promise and commitment.They neglect the importance of the time, resources, and energy required to succeed. Many of them assume that starting a business is only forming an idea in the head and trying to run with that.There are many more aspects in starting and running a successful business and it is not an easy task under any circumstance. Therefore, you must be careful not to let your concept snowball into something complex.Examining and scrutinising market feasibility is one of the most important initial tasks one must perform before getting into an actual business activity.A business entity can move forward only if there is a market and a clientele is available.A feasibility study must not necessarily be a complex document with complicated mathematical calculations, but a simple set of notes defining what you want to do and how it can be done.InformationThe entrepreneur can obtain information about the chosen business by talking to people already in similar businesses or through secondary data available at various information sources and websites. Also, you can approach industry experts to derive firsthand knowledge. Nevertheless, a study about the products or services of the intended business is a must.A feasibility study can give you the current and future market conditions and insight into the functional requirements, competition, and more importantly what exactly the potential customers need.When the entrepreneur understands that there is a market available, he or she can analyse the negative aspects that are omnipresent in any business. When analysing the feasibility, you will come across possible hindrances that can lead to risks.Taking risks is a vital aspect of entrepreneurship. However, those risks must be taken after analysing them with possible negative repercussions in a failure.Therefore, the first step is to assess and protect what you already have as assets. The entrepreneur, before the start, should do a risk analysis and understand what will be lost if the new effort does not succeed.For example, if you are engaged in employment, you must know whether the income you receive can be earned by the business in a specified period, after deciding on a reasonable grace period. Hence, keeping the day-job at a start-up time is not a bad idea. (However, this has to be done if your planned business does not have conflicts of interest with the employment).Otherwise, the business will consume your assets and end up in a cumulative loss in a short time. Therefore, it is important to understand whether you can earn what you had been earning before the start of the business.It is known that the time invested in a business plan will pay off many times over in a business. Therefore, formulating a simple plan covering all aspects of financial and operational functions is compulsory for a new business, irrespective of the size of the investment.A business plan provides you many obvious benefits. Such a plan can work as a blueprint you can use to direct the energy to keep the business on track and as a timetable for achieving business goals.Through SWOT analysis, you can not only make projections but also plan all your practical business strategies. It will help you in the prioritisation of critical capital disbursement and future cash flow projections. However, you must not go overboard with a lengthy and complex plan at the initial stage. In reality, often the start-up plans are being deviated from the original when the business grows in size.NameAnother important task is to come up with a great name for your business. This is seemingly simple but in reality, it is not. There are various angles to consider when selecting a name. Selecting the right name, even when the start-up is small, bears a significant impact.A name should be selected after considering the long-term vision of the entrepreneur barring superstitious beliefs and emotional principles. Some of the important aspects to consider are the sound it generates, length of the name, relevance to the core business, possible diversification, or extension in the future. When the business is up and running, the name must not be changed arbitrarily. Hence, conscious and deep attention must be rendered to name the business.Setting up a business with partners has positive and negative repercussions in the long run be it siblings, relatives, acquaintances, or associates. Therefore, a clear cut deal about partnership arrangements must be agreed upon with the selected partners.While the capital and other financial and non-financial contributions, and risks can be shared, joint business decision making can be tricky in functionality in the long run.Therefore, it is recommended that vital features such as the business relationship, individual functions, shareholdings, profit sharing, commitments, and so forth should be agreed upon before the start-up. It is essentially important to have these agreements in writing and proper records at the start in order to avoid possible frictions later on.An entrepreneur starts a business with his original business idea even if such business is being practiced by others. Therefore, protecting the original idea, plans and strategies are essential. Therefore, when discussing with outsiders and, specifically when the recruitments are done, caution must be exercised to prevent information leaks, at least until the operation is fully functional.Important characteristicsThe market, marketing, and clientele are the three most important characteristics of the success or failure of a new business entity. Therefore, the role of marketing and the revenue generated through sales are of utmost importance. From the word go, the new entrepreneur must market the product ‘like crazy’. Usually, businesses allow a limited grace period at the ‘launching period’ to bring in revenue. In my opinion, this grace period should be ignored totally and try to make sales revenue from the first day, or even before the launch if possible.It is common knowledge that marketing takes over everything else in business success. As such, communicating with potential customers is one of the first tasks in a new business. Particularly, at the initial stages, when the company and the product are little known in the market, the maximum effort to make the prospects aware is very important.The digital medium is exceedingly cost-effective and the reach is immeasurable as well. Besides, there are many other benefits available in marketing with digital media, although the heavy clutter at times can be an issue. Hence, using digital platforms is hugely useful at the time of starting to curtail expenses.Knowing your immediate competition is as important as your own business because your new entity is preparing to enter into the market of other similar businesses.Therefore, thorough research about the competition will be immensely helpful to the marketing effort. Information on competition will direct you to formulate effective strategies to keep ahead of the competitors from the beginning of the operation.Finally, one of the most important ingredients in business success is the passion of the entrepreneur which will drive him to succeed. Having said that, it is important to state that passion and enthusiasm will drive you in the right direction although caution must be exercised in business decision making based on the knowledge you have acquired through the factors discussed above. "
31 May 2020, Positive leadership vital to overcome crisis,"There is no easy route through the crisis. Besides the obvious problem of selecting the correct path to take when the problem is complex, leaders also face the monumental task of reassuring the employees and persuading them to follow through on strategic decisions – even when measures such as social distancing – with its knock-on effect on employment – come at great personal cost.A correct start is vital and a wrong move could erode trust and unleash unrest that exacerbates the existing dangers. But it remains to be seen whether our business leaders will rise to the occasion with the appropriate response. What we have so far seen is mixed opinions and ever changing opinions of Sri-Lankan top notch business leaders. It’s true that for business leaders, the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated unprecedented change and by no means is it an easy issue problem to fix. More than ever, the health of businesses is urgently and visibly linked with the health of workforces, the health of our society, and the health of the consumers and our planet.Previously unimaginable shifts in our daily lives are compelling companies to adapt quickly and identify creative, unconventional ways to operate and survive. Uncertainty makes it more difficult for leaders to find their footing — and those who like to operate from a place of clarity are finding few ports in this global storm.The question most leaders are facing, then, is this: How do we move forward in such uniquely uncertain circumstances? Positive, effective leadership helps us navigate crises, rebuild communities, and forge ahead in moments of ambiguity. But with so many challenges colliding at the same time, many leaders may be struggling to chart a clear way forward. But it’s paramount that the leaders use all their past experience, wisdom and strategic capability pool they have in the business to analyze, comprehend and decide which way to go. Quickly rediscover your new purpose or re-emphasize your current purpose depending on the nature of the impact. The temptation for businesses in moments of crisis is often to get small, to hunker down and zero in on the bottom-line fundamentals and metrics. Now, instead of narrowing the focus, leaders in a crisis should consider pulling back and reminding themselves of their guiding principles.Emphasising purpose will also signal your intentions to the wider world, instilling confidence and goodwill among stakeholders who share your principles. In times of change, employees, customers, and investors alike will gravitate towards organisations whose purpose reflects their personal values and beliefs.  So get the right alignment or realign fast. Galvanize trust The next step is to ask what action you can take to protect and support those who rely on you and the organisation — especially those who may be particularly vulnerable or whose needs are becoming increasingly acute. That means taking stock of who your stakeholders are — from customers and investors to employees, communities, and society as a whole.It means identifying what they need — and recognising that these needs may differ in each case. And it means determining how you can serve them most effectively, from short-term decisions like how to continue operations at a time of physical distancing to other long-term considerations. It may also include potentially redesigning supply chains to support local employment while also strengthening the resiliency of operations. Your stakeholders are the people who drive and measure your success, and particularly when success feels elusive, recommitting to them can galvanize the trust, confidence, and morale required to forge ahead.You should prioritise your emotional and organisational resilience. Even with a strong purpose and a plan to serve your extended community, your progress may not be immediately apparent. You will need to marshal resolve in order to stay the course — and to handle the kind of attention that comes from doing so.To make that adjustment, identify and access the actions and behaviors that make you a more thoughtful and capable leader — whether that involves making time for activities that restore your energy, pursuing the space you need to gain perspective, or simply ensuring that you are getting the sleep you need. In short, find balance.Equally important is empowering the right individuals and teams for the ‘new normal’ which may not be the same – you might have to remix and re-match the capabilities and  next level leaders you have as the leadership demands may have changed. Different leaders can handle different situations better than others – so the same structure may not be the best fit.When faced with an overwhelming volume of critical decisions, leaders may feel the urge to limit authority and tighten control. But organisational resilience depends on more stakeholders and diverse perspectives sought from across the organization. Empowering leaders with the right temperament and character — those who stay curious and flexible and are willing to make the tough, even unpopular calls — is vital for thoughtful and swift decision making.Every step involves choices that are tough to make even in good times, let alone in uncertain ones such as the current, but the same instincts and actions that will see us through this current global crisis will also make us stronger as we face longer-term challenges.The ability to understand who we are and what we value, recognize our responsibilities and our opportunities, and chart a course based on our most fundamental goals while supporting our own emotional resilience and that of our organization — these are skills that will fortify us in the years and decades ahead.As we navigate an uncertain road today, our approach to this moment will inform the way we lead tomorrow."

3 January 2021,"Sales and marketing: Paradigm shift in thinking, the need of the hour","With rapid changes taking place in the business world, sales and marketing professionals need to accept the changes with alacrity.If you want to be in the “first place”, you need to change. You need to adapt to changes. Change was considered as “Pain” in days gone by.But, “Change” has to be considered as, “Growth” and “Prosperity”.Changes are inevitable in the sales and  marketing world. Managers need to keep an eye on the constant changes occuring in the micro and macro environments.Customer needs and wants are changing swiftly. The four Ps in marketing, Product, Place, Price and Promotion need to be handled more carefully and consciously in today’s situation and in the future.“Promotion”, particularly “One-to-one-Selling” has to be redefined. You need to prepare “tailor-made” plans to reach your external customers.Companies have to address the pressing issues and dilemma on changes incustomer buying behaviour and to satisfy their needs and wants.  Companies are also unable  to make products  freely and continuously available to customers, following the corona pandemic due to shipment delays and supply chain disruption. More vibrant, contactless services need to be identified and implemented in the service industry. These have to be carried out diligently, effectively and efficiently.Marketing plansCompanies also need to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies and to skillfully prepare their sales and marketing plans.With these changes taking place, the strategy period has to be redefined.Gone are the days where the companies had their “10-year plan”.You may consider having your long term sales and marketing plans restricted to three to five years.You need to choose the right person to do the right job at the right time in the right way using the right cost and budget to get the right (desired) result with the available resources. Never in the history of sales and marketing, had you to battle with crises and conflicts which had a major impact on your business.It is a herculean task to prepare and achieve  the sales forecast and set sales and marketing budgets beside making field visits more productive.Sales and marketing professionals  are compelled to work remotely which has resulted in their inability to attend office for meetings and discussions on designing, planning and implementing strategies and for budget meetings.Hence, you need to develop skills to be a strong and effective change, crisis and conflict manager to navigate the business to a viable and profitable business.You need to focus on the “growing growth” of the business through the years and not merely “ordinary growth”.  You should strive to achieve a “double digit growth” in the coming years as “single digit growth” is insufficient to meet the “Challenges and Opportunities” following the corona pandemic. To reach this growth target, you need to first develop a “growth mindset” among your employees.“Smart working”Some sales and marketing representatives may complain that they work hard but there is no result. They may say that they work for 10 to 12 hours a day.Teach them the importance of “smart working”. Tell them it does not matter how long a batsman stays at the crease but what matters is how many runs he scores.Similar to a batsman who needs to play positive and powerful shots and make the scoreboard tick, the basic role of a sales and marketing representative is to produce sales and generate business.It is an arduous task to convince them on new ideas and implementing new plans as you will get frequent complaints and hesitations from the sales and marketing forces.However, with proper training and inculcation of positive attitude to make them to think positively you will be able to sail against the winds (competition and market behaviour and market conditions) thus to arrive your destination on time.The Government needs to focus on labour laws as these have to be rewritten to benefit the employees of the organisations.It should further assist the entrepreneurs with loans and flexible repayment plans.Insurance policies need to be re- formulated to the companies and newly formulated policies to benefit its employees covering pandemic and sudden loss of job.Employers need to be empathetic towards their employees when making salary cuts and when collecting payments from their customers.A paradigm shift in thinking of sales and marketing professionals is the need of the hour to survive and succeed in the marketplace.Invest in peopleTherefore, invest in people  to improve their thinking and provide them with training and development programs.You have to not only provide knowledge but also skills and inculcate good attitudes and make those attitudes a habit. Identify people with high calibre during job interviews and recruit them. Though you may have to pay a premium price to hire them. You could consider these people as better investmentsfor your company. Since you may have employees with negative thinking,teach them not to pray for the heavy rain to slow down  but rather how to hold a better umbrella during the rain.Similarly, when the sales targets are set they should not complain that it is too high and request you to reduce the target.Rather they should depend on their knowledge and skills acquired from the training received from the company.It is a cardinal rule that you must ensure to identify “training gaps” and provide training to equip themselves to meet challenges confidently.Inspire them only “perform” and not to list out the “Problems” to you. In essence make them “exceed” the company expectations and not make “excuses”.Open your employees eyes to the facts of “Speediness, Quality, Originality, Creativity and Innovativeness” in their thinking and work. If you can innovate you could lead and you need to do it faster. Develop dynamic leaders to take care of your people, customers, business and organisation. It is of paramount  importance to “train the trainers”. Identifying leaders is an art. Conduct  brainstorming sessions during your monthly sales and marketing meetings or when the need arises to get ideas and to make them accept your ideas and plans. Make them to generate ideas and put those ideas into action. It is better to have pre-empt strategies for your staff now prior to embarking on your “new vistas” in sales and marketing this year. Should you be interested in delighting your internal and external customers, you need to think and act fast as “speed is the name of the game” and the “need of the hour” in the ever-changing business world.Sales and marketing professionals are well known for their resilience. You could bounce back. Rise from the ashes like the Phoenix. Your people could make the difference.Make wise decisions today, as in business, “speed is the name of the game”.The writer is a sales, marketing, training  and business consultant with 30 years of experience."

10 January 2021,Show gratitude to your employer this year,"While some big companies reduced employee benefits as a means to reduce cost in the new normal world. Some companies thought otherwise and looked after their employees respecting the notion and principle that employees in fact are its best asset. This is the year for you to pay back to your employer. We all need to know that we’re important in other people’s lives. We all want to be noticed, valued, respected and rewarded -that we all know and ponder about day in day out.Our whole focus is on ‘what’s in it for me’. Well you deserve what you deserve!  At the same time as employees we have our obligations to the employer as well. The give and take policy applies in its true spirit to the ‘employer – employee relationship’ too. Gratitude is at the core of all healthy partnerships. It’s important for you to also understand the difficulties and objectives of your employer, and then do the work you are being paid to do with honesty. Fulfill all of your job responsibilities with a “sincerity of heart” – I repeat with a ‘sincere heart’. You have workplace rights – rightly so, but at the same time you do have to do your job meeting expectations and respect your leaders vision — as in showing them consideration for their effort to keep the team intact and motivated for results that benefit all.Love and empathyHow about showing a little love and empathy to your employer? You may ask - What? The same people who gave me no or a very small salary increase this year and laid off my buddies? We are all too quick to go for the negative aspects of working in these tough times. But how about one single reason to be grateful for - you have a job and a guaranteed income. The majority of employees would never say they earn enough or are paid well – that’s nature. But mind you many are not so lucky to have a job like you.It’s important to check both sides of the coin before you express your feelings and pass judgments. It’s your contribution that will make the business grow. You have to first give and take back your share.Show gratitude to the employer? How can one do this? Oh… in numerous ways, it varies from place to place but there can be common themes that run across the majority of employers – no matter what industry and business you are in.Volunteer for an important value creating project done by your colleagues in another department. Maybe it’s not an interesting or resume-enhancing one, but it will help your bosses to sustain your benefit package or even enhance it.Work overtime or sacrifice a few hours during weekends if necessary without any expectations of acknowledgement or future compensation. Ask yourself – have you not rejected such small extra contributions for the betterment of the organisation? How many times have you engaged in such activities wholeheartedly? You should train yourself to see the end result of your extra voluntary efforts.FeelingsGive reasons to your bosses to recognise and reward you. Don’t blame them if they have read you right and placed you where they think you should be. After all, your bosses have similar feelings like you and they need inspiration and motivation.How have you shown your employer/boss you’re grateful lately? Your employer takes ultimate responsibility to pay you regardless of whether the company has made profits or not.Your employer gives you the security of a regular income and annual benefit package you can plan and depend on. Your employer takes the hit when there is an economic collapse or slowdown, the dollar rises or falls, fluctuating interest rates or some other business sensitive market situation arises.Your employer deals with bitter and prohibitive regulations and legislation that negatively impacts the business, pays high taxes and duties and makes various other contributions to the economy that helps your country men to have a decent quality of life.You get to go on holiday with your family and leave the business behind – isn’t this guaranteed. Most of all you can leave the organization for better prospects or for any personal reasons.  How good is that?Have we ever tried to understand and comprehend the value of our employer and extended the gratitude in whatever form or shape to say thank you and also feel good about the attitude of gratitude which all good human beings should nurture and respect.Never too lateCultivating gratitude is one of the simpler routes to a greater sense of emotional well-being, higher overall life satisfaction, and a greater sense of happiness in life. People with a greater level of gratitude have stronger relationships in that they appreciate their loved ones more and their loved ones, feeling that appreciation, do more to earn it.Those who are happy, sleep better and enjoy healthy relationships - grateful people tend to be healthier people.Fortunately, gratitude can be cultivated, and this can be accomplished in several ways.During the next few weeks, try some of ways of and exercise good examples of gratitude you get exposed to, and you will notice a significant increase in your feelings of gratitude -— you will likely find yourself noticing more positive things in your life, dwelling less on negative or stressful events and feelings of rejection and having a greater sense of appreciation for the people and things in your life.To start with when you notice yourself grumbling about a negative event or stressor in your work life, try to think of four or five related things for which you are grateful. Learn from others who are better than you – never benchmark with colleagues who do not demonstrate the ideal behavior and attitude.Know that your bosses know to compare the right way. So you cannot hide behind – you are exposed, which has its own merits and demerits. StressMany people cause themselves unnecessary stress by making comparisons. More specifically, they cause themselves stress by making the wrong comparisons.They compare themselves only to those who have more, do more, or are in some way closer to their ideals, and allow themselves to feel inferior instead of inspired.In cultivating gratitude, you have one of two options if you find yourself making such comparisons: You can either choose to compare yourself to people who have less than you (which reminds you how truly rich and lucky you are), or you can feel gratitude for having people in your life who can inspire you.Either road can lead away from stress and envy, and closer to feelings of gratitude. Employers are often seen as the bad guys when in fact they are everyday heroes and optimists. If you are in a job right now, accept that until the time is right, a job is a very great privilege and go say ‘Thank you’ to your bosses today.Developing gratitude is one of the most important and essential  things that you can do to attract and manifest the things that you desire into your life – in this case through your employer. "
26 March 2017,Venivelgeta: new technologies for an old herb,"Venivelgeta, which is highly sought after, for health-care and cosmetic purposes, is finding new uses in battling diabetes and cancer. Today, new technologies are being utilised to cultivate it on a large scale and to extract its essential therapeutic compound.The venivelgeta vine (Coscinium fenestratum), known as atturam or kadari in Tamil, and internationally as tree turmeric or false Columba, grows wild in South and South-East Asia.It figures on the list of highly endangered species, because of the time each plant takes to mature, which makes it vulnerable to over-exploitation. Certainly there is a growing, already high demand for the thick stem and root, to produce medicines, wellness products and cosmetics. Now, the demand is likely to be turbo-charged by the needs of new therapies, emerging from current scientific investigationsVenivelgeta is widely used in Asian indigenous medical systems, including Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Sinhala vedakam. A study by the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) and the Wayamba University found that approximately 31 tonnes of venivelgeta are used therapeutically by practitioners of indigenous medicine in Sri Lanka each year. Companies producing skin care and cosmetic products use even more.“The component of venivel of therapeutic value,” says Dr MenukaArawwawala, Principal Research Scientist, Herbal Technology Section, “is called berberine.”Berberine, a complex organic chemical compound containing nitrogen, gets its name from the barberry (Berberis vulgaris), in which it is present. The herbsrasandu (Berberisaristata) and rasakinda (Tinosporacordifolia) also contain the substance.“It has an anti-bacterial action,” says Dr Arawwawala, who has worked on extracting the substance from the trunk of the plant, and on developing standards for berberine content in market samples, “and is used in traditional medicine for reducing fever and for digestive disorders.”Multi-purpose drugWidely used for thousands of years as an antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory drug, as well as a gastrointestinal remedy; by South and South-East Asians, by Chinese and by American Indians; the cosmetic applications of berberine include use in fairness creams, body lotions, soaps and bath additives.Recent research has also pointed to its efficacy in treating diabetes. In 2008, the Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Pennington Biomedical Research Centre, Louisiana, in the USA jointly carried out a pilot study.They found in berberine, a safe, low cost and potent treatment for excessive blood sugar. Two years later, scientists at the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine found that berberine mimics the action of insulin in lowering high blood sugar, but did not increase insulin levels.Berberine also has potential as a therapy for cancer. Scientists at the University of Coimbra in Portugal: found evidence that berberine interfered with the metabolic regulation of tumour cells, making it a safe anti-cancer agent.Scientists at Patanjali University in India found that, used with curcumin, the principal chemical in turmeric (Curcuma longa or, in Sinhala and Tamil, kaha and manjal respectively), berberineworked against cancer. Researchers at the University of Macau in China tested the effects of the combination on breast cancer, concluding that it offered a pathway to prevention and treatment of the disease.Limited availabilityOne of the inhibiting factors slowing down research is the lack of availability of berberine. Venivel takes 15 years to mature and flower, meaning that both availability of the raw material and of seed stocks is limited. Seed stock also lose viability over time.This limits the viability of venivel as a cultivated crop. It also impedes the ability of producers to meet the expected exploding demand, due to the research which has taken place.Herbal products manufacturer Link Natural Products (Pvt) Ltd uses venivel in its traditional medicines, such as Samahan and Pas Panguwa, and in its skin-care and cosmetic formulations. The company collected its stocks of the liana from the forests, in the time-honoured way, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Link began looking at methods grow venivelgeta creepers, to speed up production, and obtained the services of PriyanvadaWarakagoda, a post-graduate student at the University of Ruhuna. Researching for the company, at the university’s facility at Kamburupitiya, she concurrently wrote her PhD thesis on developing an agro-technological package for herb production.Venivel is usually propagated from seed, but this is an inefficient cultivation method, since only about 10 or 12 plants grow successfully from 100 seeds, the hard seed coat discouraging germination – which only takes place after six months.Warakagoda and her team first experimented with improving the success rate of germination from seeds, which they collected from lianas in the Sinharaja, Kannelia and Wilpita rainforests. They achieved considerable success by exposing the seeds to sunlight for six hours, soaking them for a day in the gibberellic acidhormone, planting them in a sand-coir mixture, and keeping them in uncontaminated, dark and hot conditions.Five stagesDespite a very high success rate, constraints remained on mass planting – the seed stock is limited by the rarity of the vine and the time taken for flowering.Vegetative propagation, using cuttings, proved of low success. Warakagoda turned to tissue culture techniques, or micro-propagation – a quite complicated operation, taking several months to deliver plant stock.The process involves five stages: firstly obtaining the ‘mother stock’ from seed, free of contamination, in the plant house and maintaining it free of pests; secondly pruning the mother stock, to obtain new shoots as planting material –called ‘ex-plants’ – which are surface-sterilised and placed in an artificial culture medium in test tubes in a culture room. After a few months, the stock is replanted in a new artificial culture medium, in a larger vessel, in order to induce shoot proliferation. The stock is kept within the culture room, under controlled conditions, including 14-hour lighting cycles alternating with shorter periods of darkness. The fourth stage involves rooting the stock in a new artificial culture medium. The media used at the different stages vary according to hormone usage.In the final stage, acclimatisation phase, the microplants are taken out of the culture room and planted in a sand-coir mixture, in planting trays. They are, gradually, over a period of about a month, taken out of the previous artificial controlled environment and acclimatised to the real conditions existing outside.It proved possible to provide a large plant population using tissue culture. Nevertheless, the problem of the 15 years’ period for maturity remained. So, instead of extracting from the trunk, Warakagoda’s team developed a method of using the leaves – inducing the growth of callouses, from which Berberine could be extracted. The quality of callous-sourced artificial berberine matches that of the stem-produced ‘natural’ variety.The first harvest of callouses is within six months, compared to 15 years for gathering stems. Of course, the yield of berberine from a mature stem surpasses the equivalent production of the artificial variety. However, the turnover time of investment is much less, and cultivators could begin getting a return in less than a year.This opens the pathway for Sri Lanka to become a major producer and exporter of berberine, and to become a hub of scientific herb production. "
19 April 2020,The world is changing Now,"COVID -19: A ruthless killer to human power with no mercy, has challenged the social lives and relationships. It has distanced us physically from each other to feel the value of great relationships. People have been fenced and cornered to feel the power of love and affection. COVID -19 defines the distance amongst us depriving emotions, feel & touch. Major violators of rules set by COVID -19 are directly migrated to the place of no return with no excuses. It teaches us a great lesson in the near history of the world. Thank you for shaking us and showing us that we are dependent on something bigger than what we think. The hidden forces of universe commanding us to rest and stay at home. Earth is begging us to support its rebuilding process, which has been disturbed due to unprecedented human actions and greediness. COVID -19 is now creating the future of the world today. It demands us to imagine and rebuild a better world for the next generation. It is a great opportunity in disguise for survivors who battled against by following the rules set by itself. Hence, it is time to tame ourselves and to follow the rules defined by COVID -19. This is vital: first to survive from the killer coronavirus and second to make a better world for all of us.Peoples In- Animals OutIt is strange that flora and fauna simply get on with their normal habitats, whilst humans have been sighed off with no options. However, our minds are forced to imagine & observe the natural behavior of animals around us. Monkeys climb up to the treetops grinning at us. They eat leaves & vegetations and enjoy freedom of living. Birds fly and sing while trees bends creating waves of cool winds sourced from the sea. The sea is silent making occasional thunder waves to tell the Sea Hunters to stay away from its territory. Most intelligent animals (Mammal) termed as humans on earth are restricted and confined to walls created by themselves. Animals are out of walls while people are behind the walls in manmade zoo’s This is called reverse thinking by Dr. De Bono. Houses built using motor and bricks are packed with people with no hopes and expectations while natural habitats in villages have become the safest heaven for people.What is Due for FutureCOVID -19 demands us to answer few research questions if we are to rebuild the life of mankind. These premises or hypothesizes need to be tested empirically before arriving at conclusions. Some of them are conceptual while the others are experiential in their own nature of operand.Technology Overpowers the HumanityMost of us believes that a machine can never overpower humans as it is always a human that design and create any machinery. It is a well-accepted fact that human intelligence and consciousness cannot be implemented by a human programmer, it forms itself. Some argue that machine (Robot etc.) will overtake human beings but the real question remains if it is good or bad if technology overpowers the humanity. COVID -19 forces us to separate ourselves but technology supports us to keep connected. It is technology that keeps us connected even at a crisis and helps people to maintain better relationships through social media and internet of things. Online businesses and personal communications facilitate smooth functioning of day to day lives. Technology breaks all authority levels both vertically and horizontally. It creates a fully pledged networks amongst all of us and new value chains are created at the expense of real humanity. The pertinent question that we should ask ourselves is that what if the same situation continue with new generations by distancing people at social and physical levels.Truth is Minority Not the MajorityOnce Soren Kierkegaard said “truth always with the minority, and the minority is always stronger than majority”. Minority is the vital few with a strong and tested knowledge while the majority is illusory and with untested opinions. In any given situation, opinion of the minority is well refined, and it is tough to implement with the support of the majority because of its power. COVID-19 forced leaders to take decision without thinking of the majority but the minority of experts. Those who took or will take bold decisions with the opinion of minority have or will challenged the COVID-19 and the rest will be succumbed. COVID -19 is the truth and the minority and majority of people will suffer due to nonacceptance of the truth of minority. Think of the universal principle that minority has the truth while majority has the power. It is a test of leadership that minority leads while the majority is silent and supportive. In term of the current crisis of COVID -9, we are still to witness the response and the power of the world leadership.Reverse Thinking is More ProductiveReverse thinking is the inverse of normal thinking. Thinking in reverse can make you more creative and productive in life. We need to identify the problem and think to create ideas reversely. C0VID -19 challenged and forced all of us including students to stay at home. We thought it was a blessing to guide & train our students in our newly built online LMS and keep them engaged safely at home. It’s a reverse thinking scenario as keeping students away from us. The norm is to motivate students to visit us regularly. COVID-19 forced us to be at home as a result, many vendors start visiting us creating a supply chain, which saves time and minimize the environmental pollution too. We can build a new zoo like in Japan with animal playing outside while people in cages with a fence observing the natural behavior of animals. Our minds are always creating paradigms and shifting them is tough without having a crisis.Business Enterprises are OvermanagedCOVID 19 taught us and made clear that many business enterprises are overmanaged and overstaffed. It was evident that many organizations in the country run smoothly while the staff is resting at home. Organizations can be managed with a simple set of technology-based management tools and the resultant cost would be extremely lower than the normal cost but with the same level of operations. Hence, COVID-19 forced us to re think and to redesign the structure of the organization with clearly defined new roles to be played by employees and the management. It is high time for CEOs to redesign their business model and value chains so that more sustainable business environment could be created for the benefits of all stakeholders.Healthy Sustainable LifestyleThe idea of living a sustainable lifestyle is about living in such a way that supports a healthy body and mind, while also supporting the health of the planet for the benefits of the current and future generation to come. COVID -19 is currently teaching us a great lesion of having sustainable lifestyle without damaging the environment. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been playing a critical role in the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of novel coronavirus pneumonia. Though health experts in Sri Lanka refute claims of herbal cure for novel coronavirus, many people in the field of Ayurveda and household levels have tested traditional medicine to improve immune systems of the body. The planet is begging from all of us to give it a rest and to have a sustainable life by reducing pollution and overconsumption of its natural resources. Hence, it is time to tame ourselves and to follow the rules defined by COVID -19. This is vital: first to survive from the killer coronavirus and second to make a better word for the next gen Z and Alfa.Dr. DMA KulasooriayaDirector GeneralNational Institute of Business Management"
20 September 2020,Govt to step up turmeric production ,"Several attempts to smuggle turmeric were foiled by the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) over the past week as the government continued to hold onto its decision to ban the import of the spice to promote local production.SLN in a press release last week stated that the Sri Lanka Coast Guard seized about 1058kg of dried turmeric being smuggled into the country in the estuary of Deduru Oya, Chilaw.During a special patrol in the estuary of Deduru Oya, Sri Lanka Coast Guard found the consignment stuffed in 21 gunny sacks, after inspecting a suspicious dinghy at the location. The stock of dried turmeric and the dinghy will be handed over to the Customs Office of Sinnapadu for further investigation in keeping with health guidelines of the global pandemic. Operations are currently underway in search of the suspects.In a separate incident, Naval operations led to the seizure of an 818kg consignment of dried turmeric being smuggled into the country by sea and apprehension of two suspects on Wednesday (16). During a special operation, the North Central Naval Command nabbed two suspects who were attempting to smuggle around 510kg of dried turmeric by a dinghy north of Mannar. The consignment had been stuffed in 12 sacks as they were recovered by naval personnel.In another special operation conducted at Vankalai in Mannar, the Navy seized about 308kg of dried turmeric in five delivery sacks, left behind at the Vankalai beach. The suspects held in connection with the racket were identified as residents of Palleimunai, Mannar, aged 26 and 37. They were handed over to the Public Health Inspector of Talaimannar for quarantine. The seized consignments had been disinfected to comply with Covid-19 guidelines and they will be handed over to the Jaffna Customs Office for further investigations, the SLN stated.SLN apprehended three suspects with over 520kg of dried turmeric attempted to be smuggled into the island in another special operation conducted in the sea of Mundalampiddi, Mannar on Wednesday. SLN stated that over 520kg of dried turmeric stuffed in 12 gunny bags were held by the North Central Naval Command as the suspects were attempting to transfer the consignment by a traditional boat (Wallam) in above sea area.The suspects who are between 22 to 55 years of age were identified as residents of Palleimunai in Mannar. They were produced before the Adampan Medical Officer of Health for inspection. The seized stock of dried turmeric and the boat had been disinfected to comply with Covid -19 guidelines and they will be handed over to the Jaffna Customs Office for further investigations.Turmeric smuggling was rampant since the government banned its import in December last year.The attempt to aid small and medium businesses and growers caused turmeric prices to sky-rocket, and in some cases left adulterated turmeric to enter the local market. However, since then the situation has improved as growers were encouraged to increase the yield. The government said it will continue the import ban.Minister of Plantations Ramesh Pathirana told media that the country can produce at least 4,000 metric tones of turmeric. This is over half the requirement for local consumption. The Consumer Affairs Authority has stepped in to impose a maximum retail price of Rs. 750 per kg of turmeric.During an official visit to Maha Nanneriya in the Kurunegala District, on September 7, Highways Minister Johnston Fernando said President Gotabaya Rajapaksa instructed agriculture sector officers to take steps to produce turmeric for the local consumption and maintain a fixed price.He said that due to the growing demand for turmeric a kilo is sold at a price between Rs. 4,000 to Rs 5,000.“Some question as to why we do not import turmeric. If we permit imports the traders will import in excess, store them and release to the local market later, which will result in discouraging the local producers,” he said adding that the Government has taken steps to build a self-sufficient economy.“It is my belief that Sri Lanka could be made a vibrant economy in Asia,” he said. Minister of Trade Dr. Bandula Gunawardena said the government may ease restrictions for re-export. This decision was made following discussions with local businessmen."
2 May 2021,BPPL strengthens commitment to sustainability,"One of Sri Lanka’s pioneers in creating eco-friendly products, BPPL Holdings, affirmed its commitment to sustainability in business in view of ‘Earth Day’ this month.This year’s theme, ‘Restore our earth’, focuses on natural processes, green technologies and innovative thinking to restore the world’s ecosystems.The Group noted that globally, sustainable management and protection of Earth’s natural resources has become a priority to mitigate the burgeoning industrial practices that negatively impact the environment.Sustainability continues to play a key role in protecting ecological health and natural resources for future generations.One of BPPL Group’s core businesses, Eco Spindles, recycles over 360,000 plastic bottles a day into polyester yarn and monofilaments. The company’s mission is to reduce the carbon footprint made on Earth by integrating sustainability and technology into waste recycling. “We embrace sustainability at the heart of our business operations. To date, we’ve recycled over 380 million plastic bottles. We are very proud of our contribution towards a greener Sri Lanka. We must all understand that Earth’s resources are exceedingly finite and engage in business in a way that protects and conserves natural resources. In today’s day and age, businesses need to be held accountable to making sustainability a part of their corporate strategy,” said Managing Director of BPPL Holdings, Anush Amarasinghe.A commitment to sustainability requires companies to engage in ethical business practices. Sustainable sourcing plays a critical role in creating responsible supply chains and integrates social, ethical and environmental performance factors into the process of selecting suppliers. To this effect, BPPL noted that the Group’s subsidiary, Beira Brush, practiced ethical sourcing by procuring their timber from FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified plantations in Sri Lanka. “FSC certified timber is a strong pillar for sustainable industries.An FSC certification ensures the use of environmentally appropriate forest management practices in the production of timber. FSC helps take care of the ecosystem, wildlife and people who call these forests home,” said, Head of Compliance and Sustainability at BPPL Holdings, Widya Karunaratne.The Group also prioritises sustainable power generation in their factories. Fifty-three percent of the power required by the company is generated out of solar and biomass energy.The synthetic filament factory at Eco Spindles is a LEED certified green building, and generates solar energy during production.The filament factory has been designed and built using strategies aimed at improving performance across energy consumption and stewardship of resources and sensitivity to their impacts.“Burning fossil fuels and continuing to deplete already scarce resources is irresponsible of businesses and individuals. The market for clean energy is changing as there is a shift towards renewables and other advanced energy technologies. Located close to the equator, we are gifted with an abundance of sunshine, making solar energy generation a very practical solution. As an energy-intensive industry, the commitment made by BPPL towards sourcing renewable energy is notable,” said Karunaratne.Reiterating their commitment to sustainability, Managing Director of the Group, Dr. Amarasinghe reiterated that businesses need to not only focus on making profits, but also understand and mitigate the impact a business will have on the environment and societies.He said, “Our biggest contribution to sustainability in Sri Lanka is through the recycling of plastic bottles. However, we only recycle up to 20% of the plastic that has been used in the market. If we are to thrive as a cleaner economy, it is critical that we implement strict waste segregation rules including the collection of segregated garbage which certain municipalities are no longer practicing, and strengthen collection efforts.”Around 53 percent of the power needed by the company is generated through solar and biomass energy"

28 March 2021,CSE  and SEC invite family businesses to list,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) engaged the family business community in Sri Lanka through the inaugural Issuer Forum for 2021 on the theme ‘Founder to Family - Leveraging Going Public’, at the Shangri-La Hotel Colombo recently.The event was organised to highlight how a family business can take advantage of going public while ensuring the family retains control and continues to guide the vision of the business and to address the misconceptions regarding listing which deter businesses from exploring an Initial Public Offering. Globally, companies access public markets for varying reasons including, diversification of funding options to lower bank credit exposure, funding for growth, attracting strategic investors who believe in the company growth story, strengthening management and corporate governance structures and to ensure survivability post-founding generation.The Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission Viraj Dayaratne said, “One of our objectives is to increase liquidity of the market. There are many misconceptions in the market. One is that the listing process is cumbersome, that it takes time and also that it can be very expensive. But it is not cumbersome or expensive as many would perceive. It is one of the best options to raise capital. And that is why we want businesses to come to the capital market and make use of the opportunities. Government has created a healthy environment. The last budget proposal has given many tax incentives which are open until the end of the year. So it is the best time to come and list your company.”Over 70 representatives of prominent family businesses in Sri Lanka were present. The content discussed included sessions on how best to structure an IPO, the preparatory process for a Family business before an IPO and Wealth Management for Family Businesses, as well as Regulatory benefits and tax advantages post IPO, which will help in balancing the Family’s needs as well as those of future stakeholders. The program also featured an interactive panel segment where  SEC Commission Member Manil Jayasinghe, Director General SEC Chinthaka Mendis, CSE Chief Regulatory Officer Renuke Wijayawardhane and the Head of Origination and Issuer Relations at the CSE, Purasisi Jinadasa took part.  "
19 January 2020,Yarlpanam Chamber welcomes package to revive ailing SMEs,"The Northern Province looks forward with renewed hope for a better economic environment for its businesses, especially the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector.“We are hopeful that the government will continue its efforts to revive ailing SMEs and with the recently introduced debt relief package, the SME sector is confident that they could contribute more towards the national economy with the funding facilities available for the sector. As the entire business community regards the government’s move as a positive development towards economic growth in the Province, the community works with much vigour to make a significant impact on the economy,” President, Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Yarlpanam (CCIY), K. Vignesh said.The business community did not have an opportunity to upscale or technology infusion due to many reasons, lack of funding being the major cause. Therefore, we will benefit from the funding facilities and are looking forward to becoming a vibrant economic force in the country, he said.Lack of financial assistance has been the biggest drawback for emerging businesses and entrepreneurs are encouraged by the government’s approach towards the SME sector. They are eagerly waiting to revive businesses and this is a positive sign towards the upward movement of the economy, he said.“We see a great opportunity in the Jaffna International Trade Fair 2020 to be held next week as it will provide the much needed platform for entrepreneurs to build business links and contacts while showcasing their abilities and capacities,” he said.Jaffna International Trade Fair 2020, a one of its kind in the Northern Province, will be launched on January 24 and will go on till 26 at the Muttraweli grounds in Jaffna.An annual event since 2010, this year Jaffna International Trade Fair will feature trade stalls, live evening musical shows, an amusement park with children’s play area, Hawker type food court and a range of seminars and workshops this year.The very first Jaffna International Trade Fair was held in 2002, during the ceasefire of the three-decade war on terrorism in the Northern region, as a mechanism to develop and upgrade the trade functions in the Northern region.The first exhibition was held amidst many challenges such as checkpoints, lack of accommodation facilities and limited resources.After peace returned in 2009, the second exhibition was held in 2010 which has been an annual event up to this year.The International Trade Fair serves as a platform to bring together Southern and international entrepreneurs and traders to meet and engage with their Northern counterparts.Jaffna International Trade Fair 2020 is organized for the 11th consecutive year by Lanka Exhibition and Conference Services (LECS) in association with the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Yarlpanam (CCIY) with the support of the Jaffna Municipal Council, International Business Council, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Consulate General of India in Jaffna.The event is known to be a multi-trade affair featuring agriculture, hospitality, education, fashion and food industries with all most all the Northern hotels going on full occupancy and other services and transport and logistics also seeing a rapid growth during the period.Organisers noted that the exhibition is also a good opportunity to introduce many value added products from Jaffna to the international market, especially the UK, US, Canada, Australia and Switzerland through the Export Development Board.Jaffna Trade Fair also serves as a platform to introduce global trends to the Northern region of Sri Lanka and as an opportunity for northern communities to exhibit their products and services to the rest of the country."
14 March 2021,Peer fighting affects business performance,"Office politics, war to get highlighted, unethical ways to claim others’ performance, sabotage, carrying tales to undermine good performers, back stabbing of various types, are common features of most public and private organisations – in large organisations in particular.Bringing people together and creating a unified culture though spoken widely, is a tedious task. Coordination, collaboration and cohabitation for team performance is of paramount importance. We all know that performance is best achieved interactively rather than through individual efforts.Learning from each other and pulling all strengths together is the only way to be productive and efficient. One significant feature in high performing organisations is making peers to work together to raise the performance standard of the team.Constructive peer pressureUnderstand this topic in context – it’s the balancing act that demands your best leadership skills. Peer pressure will always be there and it’s not always necessary to defuse such pressures – the right level of pressure can in fact help improve team performance.From the time we were children, peer pressure has had a negative connotation almost as if the people that surround us wield some power over us. Also learning from a peer is perceived to be a thing that affects one’s esteem.The positives of peer pressure are mostly ignored though an honest look back will reveal many instances of peer pressure helping you to improve; be it studies, sports or any other common activity.We put a lot of pressure on ourselves to succeed, but sometimes the most effective pressures come from our peers. So accept and add a little positive peer pressure to your individual learning strategy for all the motivation you need to succeed. Team goal If you want to increase the chances of your success – involve someone else in your plight. That’s right: share your voyage with someone else that has similar goals. If you meet a friend everyday at lunch to sit and chat, he or she will notice when you don’t show up.You’ll be more likely to show up if someone else expects you to be there. We don’t like to let others down. If others are expecting you to be at the gym, the club, or another meeting place, you’ll show up because you’ll feel obligated. Peer pressure, the taboo of our youth, can now be the saving grace of our fitness plan. It’s a positive arrangement because not only will you adhere to more workouts, but you’ll be motivating others as well – a very practical way to understand the theories of motivation; isn’t it?Naturally, most people are driven to uphold or improve their perception by others and perception is relative – relativity is comparison. Use this as encouragement and motivation to succeed. Think of a sport’s team in your old school. Good sports programs seem to generate talent, but what’s really happening is that success starts breeding more success. The hard work and self-improvement catches on like wildfire, and the inner-competition to keep-up has everyone improving their level of play.Think of ways to make those around you part of your active development – you will be amazed with the opportunities. In business organisations, the peer pressure is a given. The choice you have to make is taking it positively for self-improvement vs missing the opportunity by ignoring it. It’s not about competing against your peers but about learning from peers for self-improvement – and about learning from each other which is the best way to develop yourself.  Have policies in place well communicated and implement them with no exception to create fair play and promote true teamwork where you allow the right level of internal competition for personal growth by pushing everyone to go for his or her best. "
8 March 2020,Favouritism kills business value,"We promote various HR philosophies and organisation values to be fair by all employees and try to practise them where possible.However, in almost all organisations, there are situations where one employee is given preference over another, usually by a higher level authority, not based on performance but other considerations. Such favouritism leads to complex organisational issues at huge opportunity cost.As humans we look at links to get close to people we like for various benefits. Factors such as the same village or town, school, religion and personal interests such as sports or music bring people together naturally.In certain circumstances favouritism can be in relation to sexism and racism too. Employees coming together on such grounds end up in sub cultures being formed with different attitudes and beliefs. I’m sure you have your own real life examples either as a victim, beneficiary or seen things happening around you as a neutral person.Sadly in most Sri Lankan organisations; be it private or public, favouritism exists at varying degrees. Favouritism in public organisations is largely based on political affiliations. Some managers whose behaviour is not aligned with the company policy and accepted practices or performance not being up to the mark favours direct reports to harness support for survival.A leader whose discipline is below expectation cannot create a culture of high discipline in an organisation or within that business unit for optimum productivity. Look at a simple example; a leader who is late to work cannot pull up a team member for being late to work. Is it hard to understand the resultant loss of value to the organisation?Commonly practised favouritism in Sri Lankan organisations include; bigger salary increases and perks, promotions, beneficial transfers, easier work and selective lenient policy compliance.These cost the organisations money, affect performance and create an undesired culture impeding long-term progress.There’s no question that favouritism is a bad management practice: It breeds resentment, mistrust, destroys employee morale and creates disincentives for good performance. When employees see that more benefits flow by being on the manager’s good side, rather than by good performance, it creates a notion that there’s no or very little point in working hard.And favouritism leads to poor productivity, as employees who don’t get the plum assignments spend more time gossiping and griping about how unfair the system is rather than doing their work.No way to regulateIs favouritism illegal? Not always. It depends on why employees are being favoured or disfavoured. No law prevents companies from having lousy managers or running a workplace like a schoolyard. If favouritism is rooted in discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, then it crosses the line from poor management to illegal behaviour. Favouritism is usually a sure sign that policies and procedures are not what they should be.Favouritism not based on performance can lead to serious negative business implications. It’s up to the leaders to identify, understand and put in place policies, processes and systems to curb this issue but more importantly, lead by example to create the right culture."
27 December 2020,AgStar recalibrates business platform on shared values,"Marking a watershed event in Sri Lanka’s agricultural sphere, AgStar PLC has recalibrated its business platform to build its future on the revolutionary concept of shared values, spearheading an agricultural revival. Building on shared values requires businesses to respond to an identified societal problem by designing specific solutions to compelling needs of its customers, instead of marketing bottom-line driven products.Sri Lanka’s age-old agriculture industry is plagued by debilitating low yields and as a result is creating poverty among farmers and AgStar has identified it as a ‘shared concern’ and building on shared values means we are now gearing ourselves up to serve as a farmer’s one-stop Agent of Prosperity, says Mr. Pasad Weerasekera, Managing Director of AgStar PLC.AgStar is a public-quoted company and our story of success is fueled by our passion to build on shared values, a global ideology that calls on enterprises to find emphatic solutions to compelling issues faced by its market in building a win-win for all – farmers, community, nature and the organization, he articulated.This calls for the organization to go beyond conventional marketing objectives and channel all its resources to deliver a more holistic offering. What our farmers need badly is a push to the cutting-edge. That involves know-how and on-field direction to multiply their yields while safeguarding the soil, their richest asset, he said.A bountiful harvest is every farmer’s dream! We provide the tools: seeds, fertilizer, crop-care and agri-tech along with the know-how that would more than double their current yields, Mr. Ashan Ratwatte, Director New Business Development, said.We have made it our business to rebuild the lives of farmers caught in the clutches of poverty. What we are doing is reaching out to farmers, home gardeners and planters, guiding them to prudent practices which create a perfect harmony between their farms and nature, inspiring growth on the cutting-edge, says Mr. Ratwatte.Building a business on shared values is a long-term process and we have through research and development enhanced our solutions portfolio with seeds, fertilizer, crop care and agri-tech combined to ensure delivery of record-breaking yields while safeguarding the soil for through sustainable development, he said.Meanwhile, AgStar is realigning its employee brand, transforming especially its field force into Agents of Prosperity whose mission is to become an integral part of the lives of their customers, serving as knowledge-transfer experts with the company’s sales staff representing different product divisions now working together in providing total solutions to farmers.The mission built on shared values will culminate with AgStar supporting farmers to find good markets for their produce including the lucrative export market.Harsh ground realities have driven farmers to despair. They need hope and help.AgStar has responded to the calling, commissioning its Agents of Prosperity – a team well-trained to work alongside farmers as their guide to a higher yield.The company’s agents of prosperity will be dispersed to farming communities to inspire true transformation, harnessing world-class agricultural products and progressive thinking.AgStar’s seed bank is growing in popularity with some 20 world-class offerings designed to exponentially increase crop yields, combining with fertilizer manufactured on advanced formulas and guided by high-tech crop-care offerings.AgStar is ranked 3rd in less than two decades in an industry dominated by centuries-old giants and is building a robust reputation as a trailblazer."

4 April 2021,Ultra right wing ‘protests’ don’t fool anybody,"All the environmental crusaders, and the coconut oil crusaders — where were they when there was an ultra right-wing government in power from 2015, contaminating coconut oil with palm oil, allowing the denudation of Wilpattu, and permitting a drug mafia to run riot in the country?These types of right-wing governments displaced coconut oil as the regularly used cooking oil in Sri Lankan household kitchens, and replaced the same over time with palm oil extracts in the market, under the pretext that coconut oil helped build up cholesterol.Its regulation ultra right-wing politics that replaced governments such as Inacio Lula da Silva’s in Brazil and replaced them with right-wing rulers such as Jair Bolsarano, who had no qualms about denuding the great Amazon rainforest.But that’s ultra right-wing politics. Replacing progressive governments with regimes that work for Multi National Corporations (MNCs), by trying to skew perceptions is their stock in trade. At present, there is the attempt to whip the people into a frenzy here in Sri Lanka over allegedly carcinogenic coconut oil. It’s almost hilarious that the campaigners in this regard ignore the fact that it was the previous UNP government that caused this situation by allowing coconut oil for the first time, to be mixed with palm oil as a market product. This government was in the process of reversing such unhealthy practices.PICTURESQUEIn the meantime, a certain consignment of coconut oil with a known carcinogenic was detected at Customs and confiscated. None of this was released to the market, but the same people that allowed the abomination of mixing palm oil with coconut oil have now turned coconut oil crusaders, ostensibly out of a concern for people’s health.It’s probably correct to surmise that the palm oil lobby aided by the right-wing mercenaries hyped-up this story about carcinogenic coconut oil in the market. They would see that as a way to reverse gains by the coconut oil industry — and it’s a pity that we ever came to a pass in which this country of picturesque swaying coconut palms had to import coconut oil! But that was all due to right-wing indoctrination — which makes the current concern for health on the part of ultra right-wing MNC lovers shedding copious tears over the people’s health, curious to say the least.Did they raise their voices over the go ahead given by the previous government to mix coconut oil with palm oil extracts? Where was this great concern for the collective health of the people when MNCs were advancing their agenda at the expense of the coconut oil industry? Indeed, it’s a good question as to where any of these crusaders for a healthy population were when coconut oil was insidiously being replaced with palm oil over a period of three decades or more?In the context of how the ultra right-wing skews perceptions, it should be asked who is behind the sudden outpourings of environmental concerns on the part of various eager school children etc who never emerged out of the woodwork whenever the right-wing Wickremesinghe type administrations were in power in the last several decades?Can the backers of an ultra right-wing government that openly voiced intentions of filling every paddy field in the country for the purpose of ‘building industry’, voice any concern about the environment with a straight face?SLAVISHIt’s probably correct to say that there are more right-wing populist environmentalists today than there are trees in their collective gardens. This right-wing populism became the brand of the JVP which is supposed to be the radical left-wing party.It didn’t take long for Wijeweera’s fire breathing revolutionary movement to be neutered in this fashion. Their tree hugging environmentalism is entirely at variance with their slavish embrace of the neo-liberal Ranil Wickremesinghe in the tenure of the Yahapalana government. Of course the JVP has been fascist for a long time, and therefore right-wing populism is smack in the middle of familiar territory for them. After all, it is the JVP that sponsors fascistic student agitation by politicising the university campuses, and that’s old hat.Their Bolsanaro type populism needs some right-wing pinups too, which is why they induct rich children into their movement from time to time. All these Harinis and Chrysmals who provide free entertainment from the JVP ranks, are Black Label environmentalists. Their fealty to environmental causes increases with every shot of the beverage they gulp down, when they have their fun parties within the party of the Left.All these born again environmentalists whose love for oxygen and forests manifests only when there is a progressive government in power, have no qualms about supporting the so-called international community’s moves against Sri Lanka sponsored by rich Western nations. There is an abundance of racism in these types of moves against a country that eradicated the scourge of terrorism. If someone says nations such as Nepal didn’t support Sri Lanka in its cause — which is taken to mean that cause cannot be racist — it has to be said that racism has its enablers. Why isn’t it racism when, say, for instance the UK passes legislation to make the country’s troops immune from international prosecutions, and at the same time wants to investigate Sri Lanka for war crimes? It’s racism of the sort you’d see at soccer stadiums in the football mad country which gave the world football and the term football-hooliganism.The JVP staged strikes when the government of the time had a fight to the finish on its hands with the terrorist LTTE in 2009. Today, when there is the thinly veiled racially tinged targeting of Sri Lanka on trumped up human rights charges at the UNHRC etc, the JVP has begun tree-hugging and chanting over coconut products, furthering the right-wing MNC campaign to replace every last drop of coconut oil with unhealthy palm oil which passes off in this country as a domestic cooking ingredient.Even Jair Bolsarano may blush seeing the right-wing populism of the JVP, a Sri Lankan party of the left which took sides with his country against Sri Lanka when the recent Human Rights Council Resolution was passed. But these people are politically kindred — Bolsarano who supports the logging of the Amazon and votes against Sri Lanka, and the JVP which displays photos of loggers of the Amazon rainforest pretending these are pictures of the Sinharaja, and then supports Brazil and other countries voting in the UNHRC against Sri Lanka. Birds of a feather, you could say ...CHORUSNo doubt there is news that there is a consignment of coconut oil with a carcinogenic that was recently almost smuggled through by unscrupulous importers. But the police swooped down on the illicit operation. It’s the context in which all this happened that’s important. These days, when irregularities happen, the system works, and that’s a sign of a functional government. When the UNP was in power, car engines started seizing, because a wrong grade of contaminated petrol was imported. Car exhausts began belching acrid smoke.There was nobody from the chic environmental lobby making a song and a dance about it at that time.It’s eerie the parallels with Brazil’s far-right Bolsarano. The chic and wealthy supported him too, and they sang the chorus when he began insulting genuine progressives such as Lula.Now, the immensely popular and charismatic Lula da Silva is on the comeback trail. He is out of jail; the ordinary man in Brazil will not forget that he was put behind bars on trumped up charges to prevent him from contesting right-wing bigots such as Jair Bolsarano.The point being made is that the rich and chic will always take the side of pseudo left-wing fascists such as the JVP, along with the ultra right-wing SJB to harass a progressive government, on largely trumped up issues. The coconut oil brouhaha is largely that type of ultra right-wing false flag operation, even though the core issue of a contaminated oil consignment was true, and was dealt with.All the Jack-in-the-box environmentalists who are suddenly born again tree-huggers are also largely the chic sidekicks on hire for right-wing populists and the fascist JVP. "

18 April 2021,Maintaining retail sales momentum in the post-festive phase,"Every year, early April is the biggest season for Sri Lankan retailers when the majority of the revenue is generated. The excitement of the buyers diminishes when the New Year’s festive days are over. As an unwritten law, retail businesses experience a substantial decline in consumer spending during the post-holiday period. The slump after the New Year is unavoidable. Most of the retailers tend to relax and accept the downward trend as a self-fulfilling prophecy. The chain reaction starting from all stakeholders including owners, staff, and suppliers willingly acknowledge the common phenomenon. Instead of unconditionally giving in to the situation, if the retailer focuses on the immediate post-festive period, they can maintain the momentum of the pre-festive sales. The end of the festive season does not mean that your business has to go back to the way it was before the New Year season. You have to find other reasons to make people want to visit your retail store once again. Similar to the pre-festive period, the business can go into social media campaigns, regardless of the size of the business. A Facebook advertising campaign for customers in the retailers’ geographical area can be effective. The retailers can find any number of unorthodox reasons to make them want to shop again. The business can offer something special and irresistible to customers during this period.  Customers are aware that retailers offer special holiday offers during the festive period. Hence, usually, they do not anticipate businesses to continue the discounts offered or any other promotion soon after the festival is over. Post-holiday clearance sale is an effective method to keep the momentum of foot traffic. As the retailers tend to keep additional stocks during the festival, typically they are left with excess goods in the store. ‘Clearance Sale’A clearance sale permits the retailer to earn extra revenue from the available stocks. The phrase ‘Clearance Sale’ itself is attractive to customers anywhere in the world where they visit a retail store even out of curiosity. Slashing prices will attract more customers during the lull and the retailer can generate revenue, perhaps as effectively as the pre-festive period. Offering discounts or coupons soon after the season is a good method if practiced with caution. However, this tactic must be used sparingly. The danger is that the moment the retailer decreases the monetary value of an item, the signal to the customer can be tricky. The customers tend to think that the retailer has made an excessive profit during the season for a product that otherwise could have been sold at a lesser price. Therefore, offering discounts should be decided carefully to avoid misunderstandings or doubts.  Alternatively, the retailer can deploy other tactics such as running a contest or offering other perks to lure customers to visit the store. Offering perks such as extended warranties or extra loyalty points (if such a system is available), soon after the holiday season can give the customer a good reason to revisit the store. Another very effective method to increase foot traffic after a season is to include a discount or gift coupon during the seasonal shopping, to be effective in a future date. For example, a discount card can be offered to the customer in April (New Year season) where he or she can use that in the month of May. This strategy is successfully practiced around the world to improve post-season sales improvements. This is beneficial to the retailer in two ways. Firstly, with a proper awareness campaign, they can attract more customers during the season and subsequently get people back at the store during the lower traffic period.LoyaltyCommunicating with customers individually through SMS, personal e-mail, or collectively through Facebook, email campaigns, or through conventional media, thanking them for patronising or wishing them well for the New Year is another good concept to follow. A wish from the trader followed by a special offer can be appealing to customers and a sure way to increase loyalty. The buying behaviour is triggered by a psychological process that eventually persuades the customer to make a purchase. This phenomenon starts with the need of an individual to purchase. In a festive season, particularly the Sinhala and Tamil New year directly celebrated by over 70%  of the population of the country, retailers dream about the anticipated high volume of sales, irrespective of the size of the business. From the roadside textile vendor to a high-end shopping mall provided the best attention to their stores before a festive season to trigger the said psychological persuasion. They invariably launch awareness campaigns targeting their audiences. However, most of them drop the enthusiasm soon after the seasonal sales are over. Therefore, to keep the momentum going, retailers need to recreate the holiday buying mood and environment when the season is over. Unlocking the same emotional buying behaviour as the season is not easy, but certain types of promotions to build anticipation can help to connect with customers emotionally. Redecorating the store in a different theme or rearranging displays can be of assistance. If planned properly with the right tools, the effort can create a sense of urgency in customers. It is now known that a personalised marketing experience makes the vast majority of customers more likely to buy from the store that provides the best-personalised service. If customer data can be secured during a season, such a database to which the retailer can address can be huge. The result can be tremendous if the retailer can address the customers through the information collected during the season.  Social mediaIn this digital era, it is imperative to stay attentive and responsive on social media reach. Given the influx of offline shoppers during the season, it is exceedingly important to ensure the service response for your Facebook and other modes of communication. As discussed previously, the most cost-effective mode of communicating with customers is social media applications. Effective social media engagement with prompt response builds up customer trust and loyalty.  For almost all retailers in Sri Lanka, the Sinhala and Tamil New Year festival is the single most anticipated period of the year, for the simple reason that the celebrations are common to the entire nation. As a rule, every retail seller, brick-and-mortar or online, prepares himself well in advance for killer sales revenue. However, having a well-thought-out plan is a must for the weeks to follow. When the season passes, retailers take a break from the hectic schedule they experienced during the season. It should not be so. Every retailer must consciously engage in maintaining the momentum even after the lucrative period is over. The post-festive period even can be even better for thoughtful retailers who can use this period when their competitors relax. Therefore, treat the bygone holiday season as a rearview mirror and look out for the front windscreen for a better period."

5 January 2020,National Policy Framework : Incentives for youth to take up agriculture,"
One of the major problems impeding the economic advancement of Sri Lanka is the backwardness of its agriculture, particularly the paddy sector. This has resulted in retarding the growth of an internal market and in a failure to release workers (apart from women, freed by herbicides from their traditional task of weeding) to the labour market.
Underemployment
Low labour productivity has dogged Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector, a few years after the British Occupation became entrenched, following the Colebrooke-Cameron Reforms (from which historians, conventionally, date the so-called ‘Modern Era’ of Sri Lanka).
The expropriation of common land under the Crown Lands (Encroachment) Ordinance and the later Wastelands Ordinance, removed from the peasantry their access to a marketable surplus. Their consequent position as subsistence farmers became entrenched when they became enmeshed in debt traps to usurious trader/moneylenders. Despite the Paddy Lands Act and Land Reform, the average holding size remains uneconomic, and farmers do not have the wherewithal to introduce labour-saving technologies.
The dichotomy of rural under-employment combined with a labour shortage is not unique to Sri Lanka. The peculiarities of paddy cultivation cause it to be a problem, even in richer countries such as Thailand, where a lack of land reform has resulted in a shortage of labour for its export-based manufacturing industry.
Policy framework
The newly-elected Government’s National Policy Framework (NPF), the summary of which saw the light of day on December 14, envisages the solution of the agrarian crisis though a mixture of structural changes, welfare measures and technological fixes. It hopes, to make the country self-sufficient in agricultural products.
It has mooted introducing a ‘New National Agricultural Policy’, after an in-depth review of the present policies. One hopes that this will revisit the structure of the subsistence paddy economy.
The measures stated in the NPF suggest modernising agriculture, by introducing environment-friendly farming, economising water use and promoting solar-powered pumps, introducing high tech agriculture, and promoting the cultivation of other food crops.
Incidentally, the NPF reveals one of the major shortcomings in Sri Lanka’s development thinking, by suggesting the import of tax-free solar powered water pumps and solar cells. Why import, when the agricultural sector should be providing a market for locally-manufactured farm machinery? Sri Lanka has a developed pump-manufacturing industry, which could be encouraged to produce solar-powered pumps locally, and manufacturing solar cells is not rocket science any more.
This is especially relevant because the NPF depends on garnering the “energies and capacities of universities, research institutes and private sector” in developing the agricultural sector.
Progressive
One of the more progressive measures the NPF suggests is to expand agriculture production by providing good seed and planting materials, introducing a ‘domestic seeds policy’ to produce international-standard seeds, compulsory certification of imported seeds, and establishing a seeds bank under the Ministry of Agriculture to ensure seed safety. Although the document does not include a policy on genetically modified organisms, no doubt the seeds policy will address this controversial topic.
One may also laud the plan to promote and popularise organic agriculture, by converting traditional farming villages to exclusive organic fertiliser use, developing two million organically-fertilised home gardens, producing bio-fertiliser and organic fertiliser of high standard –using the forests and wetlands – and initiating a proper waste management system. The NPF advocates introducing an internationally acceptable organic product certification system,by improving the Sri Lanka Standards Institute to secure the certification.
One of the major problems faced by consumers is the high level of produce wastage in harvesting, storing and transportation. The NPF seeks to tackle this by combining public and private sectors in a program of action and expanding the role of railways in transporting produce, introducing new rolling stock and improving railway infrastructure.

//--><!]]>



A major issue facing the sector is the disinterest of the younger generation in cultivating paddy or other crops. The NPF envisages incentivising them by promoting youth agricultural entrepreneurship and providing tariff benefits and low-interest loans for the budding agri-businesspersons.
Farmers’ problems
The truly progressive side of the NPF’s agricultural policy comes out where it does take on the problems faced by the farmers.
A key issue they face is uncertainty, in the face of the vagaries of the climate (exacerbated by global warming) and of cycles of shortage and glut. The NPF seeks to mitigate these uncertainties by introducing a new, attractive insurance scheme as well as a new crop insurance scheme.
The proposal to re-establish the pension scheme for farmers would, of course, remove the uncertainty over the income that farmers have in their retirement.
Given the small size of the average paddy land holding, land productivity has crucial importance for paddy farmers. The NPF deals with this issue as well, by introducing a methodology to bring lands to productive uses as well as an integrated soil fertility management system. It also envisages introducing an Agriculture Crop Management System, which would optimise output.
It also proposes a revolution in the use of Fertiliser, by replacing the existing fertiliser subsidy scheme with an alternative system, providing both inorganic and organic fertiliser free of charge to farmers. Costs will presumably be reduced through its proposal to initiate a programme to produce all essential fertilisers domestically.
The real bite of the NFP, as far as agriculture is concerned, is nestled unobtrusively in various locations throughout the text.Breaking the mould
The crucial issue confronting Sri Lanka’s agrarian sector, both paddy and other crops, lies in the structure of subsistence farming. Farmers are enmeshed in debt, often to buyers of their produce, and are subject to the stranglehold of middlemen.
The NPF seeks to deal with the problem of usury, by introducing a simple, low-interest agricultural credit scheme for farmers. This would have the advantage for the government of bringing part of the black economy into the white, by eliminating agrarian ‘gini poli’ (usurious interest, getting its name from the defunct British ‘guinea’ currency – interest being a shilling on a pound, or a guinea return for a pound loan, 5%).
The proposal to promote a pre-contracts system along value chains would also benefit farmers. Prices would be stabilised by a combination of controlling import of agricultural products, setting up different guaranteed prices for a kilogram of different varieties of paddy, and expanding the role of the Paddy Marketing Board to purchase paddy without delay.
It also intends promoting co-operative farms at regional level. The country gained considerable experience in farming co-operatives during the 1970s, with a unique system of farmers holding their land, but pooling all their other resources. In developing the new agrarian policy, the government should take note of such experiences.
The agrarian policy should also take note of the experiences of other countries, which have broken out of the rural underdevelopment mould and transformed into modern agricultural economies.
It should observe, particularly countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (Chinese Taipei) advanced their agriculture through land reform (the maximum holding being 1-4 ha, compared to 10 ha in Sri Lanka), mechanisation and outsourcing of industrial manufacture to farmers (enabling them to use their leisure hours for income generation).

30 August 2020,"Whither MBAs: Rigour, relevance and results","The MBA has always been a sought-after qualification among managers. It has been hailed as a competency builder on the one hand and hacked as a money spinner for mushrooming institutions on the other.I read with interest the constructively critical insights  by Dr. Rakesh Khurana on the elite Harvard MBA. It reminded me of Henry Mintzberg, the veteran management thinker who was also critical about the typical MBAs on offer.On the local front, we launched the newest overseas MBA study group in Bahrain amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. During a pandemic, the role of managers becomes increasingly critical. All these prompted me to discuss the rigour, relevance and results in relation to a sound MBA program. Today’s column attempts to shed light on these.   Overview ‘From Higher Aims to Higher Hands’ is the title of the treatise of Dr. Rakesh Khurana. He  shows that university-based business schools were founded to train a professional class of managers in the mould of doctors and lawyers but have effectively retreated from that goal, leaving a gaping moral hole at the centre of business education and perhaps in management itself. He clearly calls for reforms in management education. His criticism of the Harvard MBA as a uni-polar MBA as opposed to being a multi-polar MBA is worth reflecting on. According to Khurana, a uni-polar MBA trains managers to have lucrative carriers in multinationals and large conglomerates. Instead a multi-polar MBA should prepare the candidates in becoming entrepreneurs, setting up SMEs in fostering innovation and partnerships in offering best-cost solutions. It gave me a sense of satisfaction,  as the MBA we offer has the scenario of making one out of five of its recipient’s entrepreneurs. In fact, we want to double this ratio through the initiatives of the Business Incubation Centre. Criticism “Management is a practice. And you learn management by practising management. Experience is critically important. You don’t become a manager in a classroom and you certainly don’t become a leader in a classroom. Leadership is earned on the basis of people who choose to follow you. It’s not granted or anointed by some holy water granted in a school.” These are the very words of Henry Mintzberg, Professor of Management, at the Desautels Faculty of Management of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. As observed by Harry Costin, “Mintzberg provides a useful distinction between business and management. He argues that MBAs teach the fundamentals of business functions, not the practice of management. What is lost in the discussion is that MBA literally means master of business administration, and therefore, even following Mintzberg’s argument, the degree does not disguise what it is really about. In essence, the term MBA itself is viewed as a misnomer. There is a wave of criticism of MBAs around the world. Especially after the global credit crunch and the collapse of giants led by MBAs, this negativity has gathered momentum. I myself have heard from CEOs lamenting that some of their MBAs know a lot of theory but sadly lack the practical approach in applying them into real issues. Taking this issue into a broader perspective, an ongoing debate in the USA has even reached a point to say that MBA awarding business schools have an identity crisis. I am confident that we will not allow that to happen to us. Yet, it is better to be proactive than being reactive.According to the Forbes magazine, Business schools have always juggled two missions: Educating practitioners and creating knowledge through research. Fifty years ago, as explained in the 2005 HBR article ‘How Business Schools Lost Their Way’, business schools shifted their focus from the former to the latter.Management became a science rather than a profession. This shift had profound implications. Business schools rewarded professors for publishing their research in academic journals, and their curriculum began to reflect the narrow focus of the faculty. Business school professors became increasingly disconnected from practising managers and leaders. By the mid-2000s, it became clear that business schools had swung too far in one direction.Ironically, we have seen a large number of people with MBAs move up in their career ladder in occupying leadership positions. I see the issue is not with what MBA is but more of how MBA should be. I presume it is with this spirit that late Prof. Uditha Liyanage, former director of PIMA said, “Do not do an MBA but be an MBA”. We have gone one step beyond in requesting the MBA aspirants to “be brilliant as an MBA”. There was a time in Sri Lanka where managers facing interviews were asked whether they have an MBA. Now the key decision makers are smart enough to ask instead from where they got their MBA. Amidst a proliferation of a multitude of MBAs, still the authentic products have a high demand. MBA as a transformation During a previous MBA inauguration of PIM in Sri Lanka,  Chairman of Laugfs Holdings, W. K. H. Wegapitiya recalled his transformation through the PIM MBA. He shared how he gained confidence and competence in handling complex business matters thanks to the MBA experience. He in fact challenged the aspiring MBAs to be thorough with analytical skills on the one side and innovative ideas on the  other. With rapid technological advancements, the need to have blended learning with the use of ICT tools is on the rise.  Greater flexibility among students and high standards in institutions need to be maintained with proper balance. We have realised the need to ensure quality and relevance at all times. It was  Senior Consultant, PIM, Dr. Travis Perera who shared his thoughts many times on the dual aspects of MBAs. They are, in a way, consumers of PIM, receiving the education from us. At the same time they are co-producers of knowledge and skills. Hence the term borrowed from the marketing echelons, Prosumer aptly demonstrates their nature. Whenever an MBA inauguration of PIM is held, it prompts me to go down memory lane. I indeed went through that transformational experience. As I started off as an Engineer and then switched over to management, I realised that the MBA would train the learner with a holistic view of a situation. In brief, the learner will enhance the functional knowledge through a cylindrical view to broad business knowledge through a conical  view. This interconnectedness transforms the learner to appreciate other functions with a broader perspective or holistic view of the business. A good MBA curriculum should consist of business realities, challenges, new ways of looking at issues and produce out of the box solutions. From my own experience at PIM by talking to the alumni of MBA holders the single biggest factor in what makes them stand out among fellow peers is the self-confidence they have gained in experimenting, creating, innovating new pathways and questioning the traditional way of doing things. As a result, the MBA inculcates a mindset to tackle issues in an innovative and integrated manner. Simultaneously, having an MBA will enhance the market value of a person. As for entrepreneurs, they will have professionals producing value for their organisations in a sustainable manner at the end of the day. The ultimate outcome is the birth of a powerful social network sharing calibre and leading to dynamic forces within organisations and of course pursuing higher benchmarks in professionalism. Speaking from my own experience, holding an MBA changes a person’s attitude to fundamentally challenge and stretch one self. In other words, enhancing one’s capacity to cope with many fronts and priorities and thus maintain work-life balance. This aspect reiterates or complements the aspect of enhanced self-confidence in an MBA holder. Finally, the time dimension is as important and must cater for strategic and operational aspects of the business for sustainability in the long term. As the educational thresholds are ever going up, the Accreditation system and Quality assurance are of paramount importance in offering a standard MBA.  I think that the success of an MBA program reflects essentially on its Alumni. It gives me pride in stating that PIM being the pioneering MBA offering institution in Sri Lanka, has during its over 30 years of existence, produced over 300  CEOs, 3,000 senior managers and 30,000 trained professionals in one way or the other. It highlights the value of an MBA with quality and relevance, locally and globally. Way forwardI quote the author Aldous Huxley: “At the end of the day what matters is not how much you know but how much you have done”.  Simply, the MBA should not be limited to a paper qualification. The purpose of the MBA is to produce professionals not theoreticians. Being brilliant as an MBA will bring out professionals who will possess a holistic view of a situation and hence will innovate new ways of thinking through the ability to think on the feet and apply knowledge more systematically. An MBA will always bring new ways of doing things to the table and deliver results for long-term sustainability of an organisation. Thus, the MBA is essentially employability and professionalism.MBAs  should never be Mentally Below Average. It should always be Mind Before Action. It reminds me of what Asian wisdom has taught us, the Seeing–Doing nexus. Samma Ditti (Right seeing) should lead to Samma Vayama (Right action). A good MBA helps the learner to see things clearly and do things cleverly. That’s what we need in a turbulent world with chaotic competition all over."
3 May 2020, Goal setting for business success: A post Covid-19 need,"Almost all business entities in Sri Lanka are provided with an opportunity to revitalize, reinvent or renew the business strategy in order to treat the new world order as an opening to expand their existing businesses. As everyone knows, with the global crisis of coronavirus impact on business activities, many existing doors will be closed but many more other doors will be opened for positive thinking and clever entrepreneurs. Goal setting is defined as the process of deciding what you need to accomplish and devising a strategy to achieve desired results. Therefore, ‘Goal Setting’ is treated as an extremely important part of business management. For this process to be effective the entrepreneur has to concentrate on more than a mere decision on a target, but he or she also has to plan and work relentlessly on accomplishing the goal. Although almost all large and established organisations practice this all important exercise, many of the Sri Lankan SMEs don not seriously ponder on the process. Obviously, these small and medium business owners usually know what they want to do and they earnestly work on it. Nevertheless, their problem is creating a plan to get there. Therefore, now is a good time to critically look at it, study it and put it into action as many avenues will be available for small and medium enterprises due to the new situation created by coronavirus. It must be noted that the actual plan must be long term but it must be broken into several short term targets covering a suitable period of time for it to be most effective.  When an organization sets a goal, the priorities of each individual member becomes clear and shows them what they need to focus on during a specified period of time. This practice creates a sense of direction, boosts morale, promotes teamwork, provides motivation and finally allows the entrepreneur to measure the success reasonably accurately.  Therefore, there is no question that it will help increase the productivity, thereby the success of the business. In my long experience in the private sector, I have found that the best guide for goal setting and to ensure its success is to peruse the acronym ‘SMART’. It says that the goal must be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound. This is a simple guideline anyone can follow based on criteria attributed to Peter Drucker’s theory of ‘management by objective’ concept. The ellipsis explains that the goal must have a specific indication of the monetary value and that the end result of the effort can be measurable. It also states that the goal must be realistic but it must be challenging as well. No company set targets to be achieved with ease. Usually, when the target is set at a demanding height, the team works extra hard to achieve and this should be the objective of the company. Moreover, the set goal must align with your long term plan and be relevant to the ultimate financial and marketing objectives. Without a specific time frame, the success cannot be measured. Hence, long and short term goals essentially should contain a time limit.   Incentivising the goals is a vital practice many successful organizations perform to motivate the staff. Incentive schemes not only strengthen the enthusiasm of the team, but also promote favourable behaviours in the workplace.  Usually, this practice guarantees positive and consistent development in predetermined targets. However, the entrepreneur must be cautious about the organizational culture and make sure that a toxic work environment is not created by high targets and tailor the incentive schemes accordingly. It also is very effective if the entire staff can be involved in the scheme.         As discussed, whatever possible incentive scheme is significant to hold your team accountable. So as to manage and direct the team toward the goal, you must create a system to keep track and monitor individual tasks. By way of a simple tracking technique with ideally a daily reporting method, all intended tasks can be monitored closely to keep team members on the correct path. This practice is dual supportive to the achievement of the goal in promoting the team spirit on one hand and providing precise and important management information on the other.Constantly reminding the larger picture and the impact of the short term goals to achieve that is another routine you must perform with the staff. It enhances the staff member’s ownership to the overall goal. The intention is to show them the rationale of the setting of the goal and to ensure that it is a win-win situation with mutual benefits.This action can also create a performance-focused culture in the organisation irrespective of the size of business.   Most often the goal setting is done along with a marketing plan. Therefore, an action plan is vitally important for the set goal to achieve the desired result. The action plan can be made with the team participation to inculcate more pragmatic approaches to the task. A collective effort to the action plan assures and motivates the ownership feeling among the participating team members. Let us analyse a few amazing benefits, among many, an organisation can obtain by setting clear business goals. First and foremost you can achieve much better results in a much faster period. When you start achieving the planned result, you and your team are more motivated and committed to the task and work harder for the rest of the outcome.The effort of setting a goal creates a sense of purpose in you and your team.  When your goal is specific and precise, it persistently reminds you of the objective and avoids or minimises distractions. Once you are adapted to the clear sense of achievement through the process and more organized through a plan, you have a clear vision of the future. You know what your priorities as well as your teams and the progress at any given moment. The immediate benefit is that the tasks for the accomplishments are known to you. Having this information out of your own brain will reduce the stress and it will allow you to focus more on business and make clearer decisions. Finally, do not forget to celebrate and reward your organisation on progress as realising the business goal is harder than setting the goal. Therefore, take time to acknowledge the improvement and encourage the stakeholders at any and every possible occasion.Team celebrations always bring renewed motivation to everyone involved and bring you closer to your ultimate goal. "

30 May 2021,Port City Colombo invites investors,"Port City Colombo, slated as the “Gateway to South Asia”, now officially becomes the country’s first service oriented Special Economic Zone (SEZ). Parliament passed a powerful Bill recently enabling a giant step in Port City Colombo becoming a pivotal global financial and services hub for South Asia. The act provides a stable policy environment; backed by efficient administrative processes coupled with globally competitive incentives.CHEC Port City Colombo, the project company’s Managing Director Jiang Houliang welcomed the timely and strategic decision taken by the Government in enacting the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill. The project company has expressed confidence in the said bill and believes that its enactment will provide the required progressive policy environment and ease of doing business to ensure Port City Colombo will truly be the envisaged catalyst in driving much needed FDIs and promoting export of services.The Project Company invites investors to connect with the company’s marketing team and explore the unique investment opportunities now available at Port City Colombo and to be a part of South Asia’s city of the future.As per the new law, Port City Colombo will be an international business and multi-services Special Economic Zone with operations in any recognized foreign currency. Experts say that Port City Colombo SEZ will fill the gap between Dubai and Singapore, to be the most sought-after hub with modern infrastructure in place. Late last year, CHEC and Sri Lanka’s Browns Investment signed a $1 billion joint venture for Port City Colombo’s first vertical development project - the Colombo International Financial Centre (CIFC). Director Sales and Marketing for Port City Colombo, Ms. Yamuna Jayaratne said, “Sri Lanka already enjoys a 70 to 80% advantage in the cost of doing business in comparison with established and mature services hubs such as Hong Kong and Dubai. The enactment of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill will serve to further enhance this cost advantage; but more importantly serve to address investor pain points such as efficient and timely dispute resolution and administrative efficiency in terms of approvals.This improved ease of doing business; coupled with cost advantages, geographic location and the quality of life on offer in Sri Lanka would serve as a first step in creating a compelling value proposition for investors. The state of art future ready infrastructure built on sustainable principles within Port City Colombo surrounded by the natural beauty that Sri Lanka has to offer provides an enviable physical setting required to compete with any world class modern metropolitan city.Therefore, we are very confident that Port City Colombo will be a catalyst for FDIs into the country.” On the sideline to the SEZ law enactment, Port City Colombo launched its awareness campaign ‘Loku Ratak’ locally and is also planning its global launch campaign within the year. However, plans remain fluid due to the global Covid pandemic.  "
10 May 2020,Significance of sales lead generation in business,"When I started my career in sales, over three decades ago as a sales representative, I was compelled to go through an agonising and tedious process to locate customers.  During the pre-internet period we did prospecting, as we called it at the time, by going through piles of newspaper advertisements, an endless number of printed lists and directories, speaking with acquaintances or by doing cold canvassing. However, for the modern salesman, all sorts of directories, lists and websites are available at their fingertips to hit upon a possible buyer. An important criteria to keep in mind is that there is a difference between a lead and a prospect. Any prospect is a lead but not every lead is a prospect. A lead is an uncertain possibility and only after a qualifying process does a lead become a prospect. Once qualified, the lead becomes a prospect, belongs to your target group, able to make the buying decision and possesses funds to make a purchase. Lead generation is an important act which involves the methods used to attract possible buyers into the sales pipeline and turn them into paying customers in the end. Modern marketing organisations use a range of practices and maneuvers to generate sales inquiries by way of television and press advertising, social media presence, networking and by using sophisticated software processes and more.  In my days as a salesman, we used ‘MAN’ or Money, Authority and Need, as a guideline to qualify a lead which will be turned into a prospect later. We were taught to save time by not pursuing any lead without these factors and that was an extremely effective parameter. Currently, companies use the BANT (Budget, Authority, Need and Timing) method which is an extension to previous techniques.  The first step of the BANT process is to investigate the financial means or budget of the lead to assess the capability of spending. Following the analysis of financial capability, the salesman needs to determine whether the contact person has the authority to make the buying decision. If you feel that the first contact does not have such authority, you must push your way through to the person who does. This way the salesman can save valuable time and energy by trying to convince the right person. Also, identifying the authority is the dominant part of the method.   Qualifying leads is one of the most important practices which should be done at the very beginning as a sales team can waste valuable time chasing an unconvertible lead. Salesmen are often known to bulldoze their way to complete a sale. However, at times, because of the eagerness and perseverance, they neglect to identify whether the lead has a genuine need to purchase. Therefore, the salesman chases a lead that may not be a prospect, wasting time and energy.  Finally, you have to evaluate the level of urgency the lead has to actually buy the product or service. If the buying need is long way over, you can plan to revisit the prospect in the nick of timeLet us look at some of the methods used by companies to generate leads: For a business entity, setting up a vigorous social media presence through facebook, instagram or linkedIn  is an ideal, cost saving but very effective mode of communicating to likely future buyers.Engaging potential buyers with success stories and authentic customer comments about the company or the brand are strong contents. You can also introduce ‘buttons’ with a message such as ‘buy now’ or ‘call for free advice’ will make it easier for the prospects to reach you instantly.  Participating in networking events relevant to the industry is another healthy way of lead generation. It is a mode of practically engaging prospects naturally and can also foster word-of-mouth referrals and recommendations.Usually, people trust good words from people who they already know. Even if you do not attract direct leads, by participating in events, chances are that you will come across people who would benefit later from your products or services. Offering free trials, free professional advisory services, samples and money back promises would be forceful tools at these events.    As professionals, you and your team are already connected to many others who may provide excellent leads. All of us talk with people in community gatherings, networking events, sporting events and children’s activities. Encouraging and compensating your whole staff to strike up conversations whenever an opportunity arises is a good method to generate new leads. In this context, sharing e-mail addresses and inviting them to introduce you to a potential lead that can grant access to a large group is another way of leveraging your personal network. Always treat your outfit as professional and offer free consultation through social media. There is no risk for the prospects if you are providing a service without asking for a fee. ‘Free offers’ are welcome everywhere in the world irrespective of the financial standing of individuals, in rich and poor countries. Create a post and constantly ask for a ‘call to action’ and you may find an amazing response by possible leads. Also offer most convenient means such as e-mal, personal call or personal visits to obtain more leads.    Your clientele is a great source for generating new leads. Therefore, a customer referral programme would be tremendously beneficial. Create a system in which you can cultivate your existing customers to tell their friends, relatives, colleagues and their own customers about your business.  A good idea is to compensate these customers, who invariably trust you, by offering discounts in future purchases, gift cards or offering benefits to the prospects they introduce.  Lead generation is an integral part of the revenue making process of every commercial entity whether it is, large, medium or small to draw in new leads. Businesses cannot expect new customers to use their products just by searching the internet or simply walk into the store.Hence, the entrepreneurs have to cultivate systems actively for results to fill their sales funnels with prospects. You can’t expect new customers to come to you simply by searching the internet or walking by your storefront. You need to cultivate leads online and in-person actively for the best results so that you can fill your sales funnel with the right prospects.The ultimate goal of any commercial operation is to work for the success and the growth at the shortest possible period. Quantity and quality of the prospects in the sales pipeline is the key to this achievement.  "
7 February 2021,"Cross-border efficiency, key to regain investor confidence - National Chamber Chief ","Investor attraction and facilitation are  imperative for the economic progress of the country for which providing an investor friendly, legal, physical infrastructure and business environment is crucial, said National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) President Nandika Buddhipala who was elected the 62nd President of the chamber last week.He said creating a conducive business environment would encourage the investors to take positive decisions. Consistency in policy framework, cross-border efficiencies, market size (local and through FTAs), favourable exchange rate policy, macroeconomic conditions and political stability would also bring in a positive note  for investor decision making said  “Increase of Foreign Direct Investment and domestic investments would  deliver more jobs, better technology and productivity and expanded market opportunities, local and international. When large scale production takes place in the economy  the surrounding ecosystem would be advanced offering development  benefits to the economy,” Buddhipala said, adding that the National Chamber has been playing a trade and investor facilitation role in this aspect.  He said the chamber receives inquiries from all over the world and we respond to each request and provide information and invite them to visit the country. “We keep all our membership and business community informed about the opportunities and arrange one to one business meetings. Further we direct them to the BOI, Export Development Board and Exchange Policy Authorities as necessary for further discussions.”   “Lower interest rates reduced the burden on entrepreneurs who were facing various difficulties, while announced debt moratoria and working capital loan schemes provided concessions to businesses and individuals,” the chamber head  said, adding that keeping local interest rate down would not only help local entrepreneurs to facilitate sustainability of their businesses and new investments but help the government to manage debt burden as well. The National Chamber was established in 1948 to  help develop local entrepreneurship in the  post-independence era. SME development has been at the centre the chamber.“Western Province Entrepreneurship Awards” for entrepreneurs of the Western Province has been held continuously from 2016 to date as requested by the National Enterprise Development Authority which opens the path for micro and small enterprises to reach national level and compete with larger scale business ventures ultimately through our flagship event, “The National Business Excellence Awards”, which has been conducted for the past 15 years. “It is vital for SMEs and Micro SMEs in Sri Lanka to access overseas markets through a credible authentic web platform. By creating such a platform for Sri Lanka, the National Chamber believes that potential Sri Lankan products will reach their market destinations easily. To meet this need, the National Chamber has embarked on a nationally important mission to develop and professionally manage a web-based platform - fromSriLanka.com,” Buddhipala said."
8 March 2020,Representing Conflict and the  Conflicted ,"The portraits are severed in half. The figures are split into varying designs. Conflict is the keyword which comes to mind when scrutinizing Malinda Jayasinghe’s paintings. It is apparent that he is not just trying out portraiture or life drawing; he is attempting to say something with intensity and passion. I speak to Malinda with the intention of locating the ‘voice’ behind his art.Malinda says he does not possess an academic background in fine art. “As a child I used to draw and paint a lot but I never did Art as a subject even for my O/Ls. I opted for a completely different stream of subjects in Accounting and Finance. After I completed my higher studies in Australia, I came back to Sri Lanka and worked for the stock market and later for a multinational company. My work had nothing to do with art but I used to draw and paint on my own regularly.”In 2019 Malinda had taken a leap of faith, a daring risk and decided to quit the corporate world to pursue a full time career as an artist. He says his understanding and perceptions changed drastically when he took a course in art history at the Theertha Academy. Malinda had been able to find answers to his unanswered questions which were pent up throughout his life. “That course gave me the push I needed to launch myself into the world of art. I learnt that art was not just about drawing and painting and that conceptualization required an in-depth knowledge of philosophy, ideology and being able to analyse critically. My perceptions were greatly influenced by what I learnt and I realized that what I wanted to say with my art could not be categorized or compartmentalized in anyway. My mind opened to a vast world of many viewpoints, angles and aspects.”Malinda declares that his art was influenced by Picasso, Cubism, Surrealism, New Cubism and contemporary artists such as George Condo and Jono Dry. Malinda deconstructs and reconstructs the human form in order to express issues which he feels should be emphasized in the current context. “My art is representational but not realistic. It is not classical representation but contemporary representation that I opt for.”“So what are you trying to say?” I probe. Malinda says he attempts to address human nature and human issues; how we are influenced by cultural and traditional dynamics as well as gender, age and perception of beauty. According to Malinda all aspects of the human condition cause some kind of conflict during our existence. An example would be the painting ‘A Portrait in the 21st century’ which showcases how we perceive women and beauty in the current context where we are frequently bombarded by information via social media and main stream media as to how ‘beauty’ should be perceived. ‘I constantly try to challenge and question stereotypical imagery. In my ‘Society’ piece I have portrayed a mixed gendered person, who is young as well as old.My piece ‘Boys don’t cry’ questions how gender roles and norms are formulated and maintained in society. I question the rigid notions of masculinity and femininity in a particular culture.”Malinda seems to question all kinds of phenomena that we are compelled to face. Most significantly how we are influenced by capitalism and consumerism. He uses diverse symbols to depict varying aspects and in one painting it is the golden ‘liyawela’: a traditional Sri Lankan motif, with thorns added, which shows how capitalism and consumerism have engulfed us as individuals as well as a society. “My background in marketing has been complemented by the conceptualization process in art. “I have seen firsthand how in advertising and marketing works we are manipulated and exploited to consume commodities we actually do not need,” Malinda explains.I ask him about his move from the corporate world to working as a full time career artist. He elaborates by describing a painting he did on Apollo and Dionysus, Apollo symbolizing success and ambitiousness versus Dionysus a symbol of merry making and being carefree. Malinda goes on to say that our culture appropriates success to career success and that in an earlier era almost all the parents wanted their children to become doctors, lawyers or engineers and now parents want their kids to be at the very top of whatever they pursue whether its academics or extracurricular activities. He views his decision to leave the corporate rat race as a conscious and responsible one. ‘I had to lower my financial expectations. I earn some money by doing commission work but I try to be disciplined in my practice. I treat my art as a full time job and am very organized with my schedule. I refrain from wasting any time.”Malinda is a determined artist with a vision and a mission. In a world where most his age would have chosen a career path of a nine to five job which requires climbing the corporate ladder, he has decided to take the path less trodden. On that path he seems to have embarked on a journey which allows him to be curious and full of wonder. That is what Malinda Jayasinghe’s art and the voice behind the art tells us."

21 February 2021,Competitor analysis - a goldmine of ideas,"The post Covid-19 market landscape can be very different to the one you have played in before. It may look the same or similar but most players have changed their game to be relevant in the shattered markets with the hope of early recovery of lost margins.Whether you are only considering your go-to-market strategy or are looking for opportunities to grow your business, a thorough exploration of the changed competitive landscape is essential for success.This is where a fresh competitor analysis enters the stage, becoming your key source of market and competitive intelligence, needed to ensure growth and maintain or reveal your competitive edge.A proper competitor analysis can become a goldmine of ideas that can help you make data-driven and more efficient decisions.Re-validating your unique value proposition (UVP), finding new market opportunities and growing your market share, identifying gaps between your and competitors’, prioritising your marketing and product development investments and discovering upcoming market trends and shifts in your competitors’ new brand positioning, target audience and product portfolio strategies.Staying aheadEveryone says that knowing your market is everything. Saying it is one thing, but understanding why it is so important will help you stay ahead of the pack. Your market includes your customers, your suppliers and your competitors – to name the 3 most critical factors.These three are pivotal characters that define the success of your business. Obviously, your customers are the ones buying from your business. A good place to start to evaluate your customer is by looking at your competitors. What are other people out there doing that is similar to your business? What are they doing well? What do your customers like and dislike about the competition? All businesses face competition – nowadays more than ever before. Even if you are the only restaurant in town you must compete with cinemas, bars and other businesses where your customers will spend their money instead of with you. With increased use of the Internet to buy goods and services and to find places to go, you are no longer just competing with your immediate neighbors. Indeed, you could find yourself competing with businesses from other countries.Your competitor could be a new business offering a substitute or similar product that makes your own redundant. Competition is not just another business that might take money away from you. It can be another product or service that’s being developed and which you ought to be selling or looking to license before somebody else takes it up.Knowing what your direct and indirect competitors are doing is an important part of running a successful business. But it’s an area that many companies ignore. That’s not a good idea in today’s difficult market conditions when your rivals could well be keeping their eyes on you and planning how to steal a share of your business. Competitor intelligence is something few firms do well, whether big or small. People tend not to do it thoroughly.Keep your eyes and ears openBy finding out about your competitors you will avoid running your business half-blind. You will know what you are up against in your market, what threats you face, and you will reduce the risk of the unknown. You will be better placed to define a competitive advantage for your business.You will know who your customers might switch to, why and how likely this might be. You will learn how good your products or service are compared to your rivals and opportunities where you could perhaps improve performance. You will be able to design sales and marketing communication strategy which presents sharper, more effective messages. Most businesses already know who their main, direct competitors are.Often they have worked with them or encountered them at trade events, heard of them through customers or seen their ads in the market or media. You should build up a list of all the main names and addresses. In addition, it is useful to think laterally about who else might be in competition for your customers.Many products and services could be considered as ‘non-essential’ and so customers may be choosing to spend their discretionary income between two very different sectors – for example, householders choosing between a holiday and buying new furniture for the home.Valuable intelligence can be gathered without leaving your desk. First of all, you can visit their website and see how and where they are positioned. Many companies have a presence on community and social networking sites. If a company is stock market listed, you can get a lot of information on the company.The best source of information about your competitors is likely to be your customers. Talk to them about their perceptions of your business and others in the same area or sector. As consumers are increasingly shopping around for a bargain, price is becoming a big issue and it’s vital to know what your competitors are offering in terms of discounts.Price is more of a justification for purchase than ever before Competitor analysis can throw up some interesting findings. You may find that your competitors are not who you thought they were. When you start looking at competitors, you often find who you think are your competitors are not actually your main competitors.For example, if you have a mobile phone shop on a local high street then you might think your main rival is the other independent phone shop up the road. But actually you are both probably competing with big out-of-town retailers as well as with online phone suppliers. In fact, having more than one type of supplier in the same area can help to bring more business your way as consumers feel they can get enough choice in the same area.In fact, your competitors could be even more varied than you think. When consumers are making difficult choices about how to tighten their belts, you may be competing with totally different products or services for their spare cash. Staying ahead of the competition is not easy but there’s no point in burying your head in the sand. When it comes to your rivals, knowledge is power.Finally, “Play hard, play to win, but play by rules you and your business can be proud of. A reputation for good ethics and fairness has a way of attracting trust. So others will want to work with you more often than against you. And that is the greatest competitive advantage of all.”"
27 December 2020,SDB Bank sets capital market milestone,"SDB bank which raised Rs. 1.5 billion through a rights issue, created capital market history by becoming the first Colombo Stock Exchange-listed entity to successfully host and complete a rights issue digitally, the event was recognised as the first local digital share subscription to be oversubscribed.In early November, the bank informed its shareholders of a decision to facilitate the application of their rights entitlement plus additional shares entirely digitally, in coordination with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). Separate systems were set up for the process, allowing for online application through the Central Depository System (CDS) for CDS account holders and via a dedicated online system developed by SDB bank for non-CDS account holders. SDB bank’s CEO Thilak Piyadigama said, “The bank’s recently completed digital rights issue being a resounding success highlights the forward-thinking nature of SDB bank’s shareholders, and it strengthens our commitment to deliver even greater financial and social value to all our stakeholders.”The shareholders responded to the notice, leading to the distinction of the first local digital rights issue to be oversubscribed.The many firsts set by SDB bank in digitally administering their latest rights issue is heartening on several counts.The positive response of shareholders to the new digital model for capital markets introduced by SDB bank bodes well for the future, and it sets a benchmark for the conducting of capital market activities in Sri Lanka in an efficient, timely and convenient manner."
17 January 2021,Effective communication in marketing,"The essence of marketing is the development of long-term and value-laden relationships with customers. Almost all successful business entities throughout the world  specifically focus on internal and external communication to build up a rapport with customers.In communication effectiveness, the two main criteria are the technical quality portraying the core service and functional quality that reflects on how the service is delivered to the customer.Effective communication skills are instrumental in generating important client trust in an organisation. Timely and transparent communication aligns perceptions that foster customer confidence in the organisation.Meaningful communication helps customers to understand the latest development in the market that often leads to eliminating misconceptions about a company, product, or service.Resolving issuesBy keeping the communication avenues open for customers frequently and resolving issues with regular follow-ups, the customer retention rate of an organisation can be kept intact. Having discussed the technicalities, let us define the term business communication.Among many definitions, I chose the meaning of communication as the process of sharing information between employees within the organisation and also with customers and other stakeholders outside the organisation.As described earlier, the process is both internal and external.A breakdown in any one of these communication processes can lead to adverse repercussions for the company. The effectiveness of business communication is one of the most vitally important aspects of business success.There are four types of business communication. They are internal upward, internal downward, internal lateral, and external communication.Internal upward communication comes from subordinates to superiors of the organisation. The superiors learn about the ground level of the company through internal upward communication that usually includes regular periodical reports and other modes of feedback.Information about the ground-level operation is recurrently updated by the employees for the smooth functioning of the operation.For example, functional information of marketing, sales, services and technical operations is delivered to the hierarchy on a regular basis.Internal downward communication is the instructions, guidance, warnings, details of special events, and other related information delivered by the superiors to employees.Downward communication is often delivered to the staff by internal memos, often via emails in the present context, or verbally. Staff membersMeanwhile, internal lateral communication is an exchange of official information among the staff members on official matters. Lateral communication flow can also be between departments or individual employees.Internal lateral exchange of information is crucially important in a company as most of the customer affairs are managed by employees at the functional level.For example, details of sales from the sales department have to be updated constantly to the service or technical department to keep customers happy. External communication covers prospects, customers, suppliers, service providers, and all other outside stakeholders of the company.External business communication also is extremely important for the success and growth as the revenue generation for the organisation are done through external customers.From lead generation onwards, constant, effective, and friendly communication is expected to keep the business running smoothly. Quality communication in business always provides positive impacts except on occasions where technology related to communication is misused or abused and when time is wasted through the continuous usage of social media.Communication media has made social life easier.Today, many free downloading messenger and video telephony applications such as WhatsApp, Viber, Imo, FaceTime are extensively being used in day-to-day life and business.Quality communication exchange improves employee engagement that also often increases productivity.Entrepreneurs are aware that engaging employees is critical for retaining good quality talent. Employees who are engaged in work are usually more motivated and remain committed to the job.The vast majority of employees believe that effective communication inside the office increases productivity by several folds.It was observed that employees daily spend valuable time in search of information required performing their respective jobs. Good internal communication flow that engages staff adequately can reduce time wasted on these searches.  Remote workThe remote working and work from home concept has become tremendously popular and highly acceptable to the business community.Irrespective of the size, many organisations, including those in Sri Lanka have transformed their operations to remote work methods after the Covid-19 pandemic surfaced a year ago. The majority of them have already declared that they will continue to use the remote work model in the future. The quality communication process will be one of the most vital factors for this model to be successful. Communicating on internal matters with colleagues while working from home can be mutually beneficial to both employer and employee in the long run. According to the labour demand survey report, the cost of employee turnover in profit organisations is up to 150 per cent of the remuneration package. This means employee turnover is a costly affair for companies.Effective communication helps companies to reduce such employee turnover. Lack of adequate two-way communication flow is one of the major factors for employee turnover. It is common knowledge that replacing an employee requires an expensive selection and training process. Organisations with engaged and satisfied employees experience lower turnover rates according to research reports.Lapses in internal communication flow can lead to stress, frustration, and disengagement, making employees immensely discontented.   Enhanced communication efforts by organisations improve knowledge sharing both with staff and also with the outside stakeholder of the company. A well-planned communication strategy is that companies can provide accurate information to the staff members and educate customers about important aspects that are mutually useful. A proper communication policy is one of the most vital factors in building a good organisational culture, in line with the company’s goals.A good culture in an organisation leads to a better workplace environment, making a team of a motivated and productive set of workers.The salient feature of a satisfied workforce is that they always are capable of producing a happy clientele."

8 December 2019,Patriotic voters vs patriotic consumers,"The recent presidential election results have again proved the fact that patriotism is a strong element of decision making by the majority of Sri Lankans. Is it only patriotism with no anticipated value? What’s in it for the people? Well my discussion is not about politics but about patriotic consumers.Most very authentic local brands have had natural deaths in the local market not being able to keep pace with the evolving market challenges due to numerous local and global developments.Other than a very few local brands that too with a minor market share, multinationals dominate most industries though you may not see or know the actual ownership of such organisations.But the reality is that most products and services we Sri Lankans consume on a daily basis are owned by multinationals - if not fully with majority shareholding. The consumer behaviour in Sri Lanka is ‘funny’.Every patriotic Sri Lankan consumer expects everyone else to buy ‘local’, but he himself buys what offers value to him. The market share split in every industry bears ample testimony. You may search, analyze and be convinced – more importantly use it to formulate the wining business strategies.While the concept of marketing is about satisfying individual customer needs and wants, the concept of patriotism is about collectivist thinking and action. Patriotism demands that the individual subjugate his desires to the collective interest of the nation, even to sacrificing himself, family, and friends.We see an increasing number of marketeers in Sri Lanka joining the ‘patriotism band wagon’ and riding free for business and marketing reasons. The synergies due to single minded positioning thus communication and influence over consumer choice provide the rationale for this platform. Few people question whether this patriotism is actually in their own best interests. But the fact remains that local brands have very little share in many industries.‘Love for one’s country’ is taken as being a good characteristic for any individual to possess no matter which part of the world you live in. We are aware that many Sri Lankans who live abroad came down to vote during the recent presidential election. In any country, the government is the biggest promoter of patriotism.Politicians love to make patriotic speeches, exhort citizens to do their patriotic duty, and present themselves as a shining example of patriotism. One political party trying to outdo the other in terms of level of devotion is a common phenomenon in Sri Lanka.The State, through appeals to patriotism, inculcates an attachment to the State, instead of the nation. The State advocates complete and absolute obedience to the dictates of its leaders as a sign of love for one’s country.Don’t ask the consumer to sacrifice. The Sri Lankan marketers attempt to foster the idea ‘my country, right or wrong’ as a prime example of patriotism. Any rational, clear thinking individual can see the foolishness of ‘my country, right or wrong’, and that it is a recipe for disaster.My focus is not politics but business and marketing. In the recent past the Sri Lankan consumer has been forced by patriotic product and service brand attributes to achieve business goals.In many cases, patriotism is used to cover up product or service gaps to exploit the patriotic feelings of the consumer to influence the purchasing decisions. Many companies use patriotism as the last refuge to market its products rather than focusing on the right value proposition that will naturally sell.For the consumer, purchasing local products and services is a good way of expressing his or her love for the country? Most patriotic consumer exhibit an emotional attachment to the brands that offer patriotic attributes.If patriotism has any value, it would be as a friendly competition between equals who have the same rights, where one hopes that all competitors do well, but hopes that his side does the best.From an economic perspective the merits of patriotism are numerous. However, it’s up to the local business leaders to effectively challenge the MNCs supported by the policy of the state.India is a good example and if we simply copy their philosophy and policy, we will have a market that will have honestly patriotic customers who actually wholeheartedly buying local brands to support their own economy.Let’s hope that the new president will make the Sri Lankan companies win for economic independence for all Sri Lankans. "
17 January 2021,Cutting expenses to excel in difficult times,"If there is a silver lining to any form of crisis, it’s that it really focuses a business leader’s attention on better cost management. However, all too often the lessons learned in an ailing economy are forgotten when good times return.Covid-19 forced companies to cut costs aggressively in areas one would not have thought about otherwise. For long-term success, keeping your expenditure low and your profit margins high has to be a top priority regardless of whatever else is going on.But simply being a perpetual tightwad isn’t the answer.Often you have to spend money to make money. The key to successful cost control is understanding which expenses to trim and how to trim them.Cheap is cheapWhen the economy rumbles and your sales volume go down and revenue is affected, you panic. When profits diminish by a little bit, you get concerned. Panic is not your friend – it leads to poor short sighted decisions.If you eliminate what you need in order to operate your business and produce what you sell, you won’t be able to keep up when customers do start buying again.If you lay off people when you need trained and experience people when the economy bounces back you will waste time in recruiting and training people anyway. It will be your competitors who will grab them given the industry knowledge they have.Don’t gift your employees to your competitors – so look at the business case for every cost cutting option available. Get your heart rate back down to normal and then peruse the options available.Cheap doesn’t mean smart. Cheap means cheap. Smart means making good decisions, spending where you need to and saving where you can without sacrificing the quality of your business cutting down fat certainly is a wise decision.Cut wiselyWith this focus in place, go through every single expense. It should now be easy to decide which expense supports your core and which do not.If it does not, then reduce it to an absolute minimum or eliminate it completely. Do it all at once. Explain the reasoning behind it to everyone and get past it.Forget growth projections for now. Work with what is real and what you know for sure. When you reset the business to match where you really are, it will be much easier to deal with focused growth from there onwards.Maintain competitivenessCovid-19 may have paralysed many of your competitors. Some of them may be under tremendous stress with markets shrinking and revenues getting impacted.While there’s no one-size-fits-all method to cutting costs, simply slashing all your expenses is not the way to go. Look at return on investment of some new marketing, sales or new product development investments to capitalise on the emerging opportunities in the new normal world.Perhaps even more important than knowing which costs to slash is knowing which ones to spare. Before any cost cutting measures are implemented that can have a negative impact on the health of the business, as a rule of thumb all other avenues to improve your cash flow and the margins should be explored. Leaders should be careful not to jeopardise the long-term competitiveness of the business.Best optionWhen everyone else cut costs and takes a pessimistic wait and see approach, you can also look for opportunities attack your competitors to encroach into their territories to expand your base for future growth.However, make sure that you do not pick the bad customers or compromise on your good business principles that can affect the overall health of the business.Remember that ‘bad time’ will always follow a ‘good time’. When making decisions take the whole cycle into consideration and its time horizons for better judgment."
16 August 2020,SDB bank’s 2020 business strategy firmly on track ,"SDB bank has continued its strong showing in the year 2020, displaying great resilience in countering the challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and is well on course to meet its business goals for 2020 and beyond.A transformational SDB bank was able to record a threefold increase in profit year-over-year, with year-to-date net profit totalling LKR 329 Million at the end of 2020 Quarter 2, compared to its performance of LKR109 Million for the same period last year.This growth in profitability was ably supported by an 18% year-over-year growth recorded in its total asset base, which stood at LKR 115 Billion at the end of June 2020.This is particularly heartening considering a large part of it ran parallel to the COVID-19-impacted stretch. The bank managed to strengthen its position as a leading bank in the MSME segment, uplifting its significant MSME customer base through novel savings and wealth creation efforts right through the pandemic-affected period.SDB bank’s MSME-majority shareholder base, composed primarily of the country’s sizable rural and cooperative populations, renders the consistent increase in growth rate for the period all the more noteworthy. "
18 October 2020,CSE scholarship for biz journalists,"Following the successful completion of its second intake in 2019 the Advance Diploma in Financial Markets (ADFM) offered by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is set to commence its third intake on October 24.In the intake the CSE has decided to offer media personnel who structure content on financial markets a scholarship opportunity to help them better understand financial markets and help strengthen financial journalism in the country.The manner in which information is articulated impacts financial instruments and the movement of its value which has been long debated in the financial literature space. This largely depends on the channels and the ways in which the information is presented and communicated. The way in which information is shaped and delivered to investors can lead to completely different financial outcomes.The ADFM was implemented in response to a growing demand for an entry-level academic qualification to enable greater knowledge on financial markets, with a specific focus on capital market operations and investment. This course which includes key concepts and constituents of market operations now being made available through a scholarship to media institutions would help them structure content with a better understanding on how material would impact investment decisions and its consequences.The course conducted in English will be carried out for nine months by an eminent lineup of lecturers and industry experts including senior CSE professionals to offer unique insights on modules.The course which consists of 10 modules provides students with a comprehensive understanding of financial markets and focuses on areas such as capital market regulation, investment analysis, portfolio management, macro-economics and other related subject matters. The modules will be evaluated through quizzes, assignments, open book exams and presentations.Commenting on the initiative CSE Head of Marketing Niroshan Wijesundere said“The course will pave the way for its students to apply theoretical knowledge while gaining a unique level of exposure into financial market operations.”“We have seen a growing interest in this qualification offered by us and we are very much encouraged by the positive feedback received. The opportunity made available for media institutions around the country to follow the ADFM program is a part of our efforts to strength financial literacy in the country which currently stands at 35%.” he added.This qualification is recognised by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) and Certified Management Accountants (CMA) providing ADFM completed students an accelerated route to secure one of these globally recognised qualifications. CSE will also be providing internship opportunities at the exchange to top performers at this course. More information can be obtained via www.cse.lk or by calling 011 2356514."
12 July 2020, Purpose-driven leadership inspires greater loyalty,"Great leaders do not depend on chance, they lead on purpose’ is an anonymous aphorism by some genius somewhere down the line.Purpose-driven leadership inspires loyalty from employees, customers, suppliers and every other stakeholder. As leaders, we have to identify and understand what we do and why we do it to give meaning to our work. Purpose allows the leader to build up teams that understand their own reason for work in relation to the comprehensive rationale of the whole business. Purpose driven leaders of teams create a purpose driven company that stands for something bigger than its products and services.  A company that is driven by purpose adds value to make a better impression than what it looks from a general angle. It brings more meaning to work performed. To simplify the concept, imagine a situation where there are three workers  in a construction site. Each one is asked what he is doing? The first worker says that he is looking for the day’s wage, the second says that he is assisting the bosses and the third one says that he is building a beautiful castle.In this scenario, the worker who wanted to build a castle is the most productive, happiest and the most satisfied person. It is certain that the third worker has a purpose in mind rather than just working for his company for a salary.  Throughout the world many businesses follow a purpose-driven leadership (PDL) model where they align the business with their core values and beliefs. For example, airlines owned and operated  by Middle Eastern companies do not serve alcohol on their flights honouring their religious and cultural values. In this scenario, irrespective of the possible adverse effects in competition, the leadership places priority on purpose and integrity. These leaders who follow the PDL model believe deeply in a cause that motivates their business decisions. Today, consumers want companies to be more than a mere merchant of a particular product and serve society at large as well.StatementsSome organisations include mission and purpose statements  in their strategic plans, while some others add purpose statements instead of the mission statements. Therefore, it is useful to analyse the difference between the two terms. The simplest explanation is that the mission statement usually describes ‘what it does’ and for ‘whose benefit’ while the purpose statement states reasons why the organisation exists in business.In short, the purpose is beyond in terms of values, morals and principles and not merely an organisational goal.  Therefore, it is vitally important that the entire organisation understands and accepts the concept of ‘purpose’ of the organisation. Traditional leadership theories we have practiced  focus mostly on what leaders do, how they do it and how they make decisions and so forth. It also instructs on how to develop a set of loyal followers and how to control them. These theories treat leadership as an ability where skills are learnt through laid down techniques.This top-down, traditional leadership is practiced by the majority of leaders throughout the world even today. In contrast, the purpose-driven leadership concept is based on lateral leadership and predominantly focuses more on moral principles and looks at the goals compassionately. Hence, every leader with a purpose has a unique ‘why’ which makes him different. It is not compulsory that purpose-driven leaders are naturally and irreversibly connected to his or her personal purpose. That can be developed through effort and learning from others. The key is to keep the personal purpose in mind and pass it onto others in the establishment.Through this  model, leaders find the strength to influence employees around them constantly and successfully due to the personal moral interest. More companies are now increasingly concentrating on the fundamentals of the model ‘leading from purpose’.Good leaders who practice the purpose-driven leadership model follow certain principles while acting on it. First, they know and analyse personal values, ethics and what gives them satisfaction as a human being. Along with that intuitive feeling about the purpose of life, these leaders act on that. When the commitments are aligned with the purpose and lined up with energy, leadership is more successful.When the leader’s personal purpose is transformative, the team’s purpose can also be made influential for the entire organisation. When the core purpose of the team is known, the members can support the mission and strategy of the organization which ultimately leads to great results. A team of leaders with clear individual and collective purposes can take the organisation to a great height. When the leaders connect the individual purpose into a broader mission, a tremendous power of engagement can be created.PathHowever, the leader has to be careful not to arbitrarily adopt other peoples’ views into his purpose. This can give a mistaken identity to the path of the goal. The leader has to be careful with the programs and systems so as not to create a dependency on the values of the leader’s uniqueness.  The systems must assist the leader’s purpose and personal path. Discovering the purpose in every action, a leader takes is about the capacity to recognise the purpose in daily activities. In this context, the personal purpose of the leader is not a goal but a path. Understanding the purpose gives meaning but does not replace the effort. However, it makes every person different from the others who do not follow this principle. Discovering and rediscovering the purpose is completely different from traditional leadership and is more effective. The fundamentals of purpose-driven leadership is to discover a leader’s personal purpose, help others to find their individual personal purposes and connect both to the organisational purpose. However,  to develop purpose-driven leadership, the mostly practiced traditional model today, the top-down version, has to be changed. That means to move away from the hierarchical leadership where only the opinion of the leader is accepted and transform it to lateral leadership to obtain the participation of the teams. In this concept, leaders develop other leaders and cascade leadership throughout the organisation. The managers should also identify others as potential leaders, not merely as subordinates. Those followers must be encouraged to pursue their individual purposes, within the context of shared collective purpose. All levels of employees in the organisation must also be encouraged to think as leaders sharing a common purpose and common goal.   In the absence of a purpose-driven leadership practice, employees may only be putting in time and their minds may be engaged but their spirits will not be passionate about a particular value. A team without a purpose is a unit without devotion and dedication. They may achieve short term results but in the long run they will not be motivated to go the extra mile.     "
14 February 2021,Getting started in shares - Part 2,"Why do investors buy shares?The form of return that can be expected through a stock investment would largely depend on the company. For instance, the return of an investment would either be through capital gains or through a dividend payment made by the company.Shares for capital growth An investor who would choose to invest in shares would do so to witness an increase in the price which would effectively translate into a profit once sold which is exempt from taxes. However, an investor should also bear in mind that he/she could also suffer a capital loss should the share price drop after investing.Studies have revealed that over the long term a share investment has proven to draw a greater return for its investor in comparison to other forms of savings or investments. Shares for dividends A dividend is a form of payment made to the shareholders, usually as a distribution of its profits. A profitable company could re-invest a portion of its profits back into the business and the remainder could be distributed to shareholders based on the company’s profit distribution policy. Certain mature companies over a period of time have been identified as stable dividend paying companies. Shares for liquidity and flexibility Shares give an investor a considerable amount of financial control because of its flexibility and liquidity. Unlike assets such as property, shares can be easily purchased and sold through the market and is not subjected to significant transaction costs. An investor is given up to three market days to settle their outstanding amount following a purchase of shares made through the market.Right to vote A shareholder is entitled to participate and vote at Annual General Meetings (AGM) and at Extraordinary General Meetings (EGM) of the company, allowing them to influence important corporate decisions made. Therefore, an investor should also note that voting rights are given as per specifications made in the articles of association and the companies act. Rights issuesA company could raise additional capital through a rights issue, where an issue of rights to the existing shareholders are offered directly from the company in proportion to their existing holding at a discounted rate in comparison to the current market price within a fixed time period. During an issue an investor could exhaust one of the three options. An investor could either renounce the rights into the CDS which would enable him/her to sell the rights (reference price is decided by CSE), An investor could reject the rights, or an investor could choose to accept the rights which would enable him/her to purchase the shares within a specified time period. For example, a rights ratio of 1 for 2 means a shareholder can subscribe to one new share for every two shares already held. An investor owning 100 shares prior to the rights issue gets the right to subscribe for 50 new shares or any of the three options mentioned above. Inflation Shares are a good investment in an inflationary environment, since share prices adjust to protect investors from the effects of inflation. Shares as a collateral An investor is given the ability to use his or her stock holding as collateral in order to secure a loan from a financial institution. Capitalisation of reserves/Bonus share issues Companies convert retained earnings (which represent the profits held in the business over time) to capital by issuing new shares to existing shareholders. The shareholders do not have to pay a consideration for these shares. This could be categorised as a benefit to the shareholders. Courtesy: The Colombo Stock Exchange"
28 February 2021,CSE: ASPI records double-digit YTD returns for 25 consecutive market days,"The All Share Price Index (ASPI), the primary index of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) tracking the price movements of all shares listed on the exchange has remained in double digit year-to-date (YTD) returns territory for 25 consecutive market days, over five weeks since January 15. YTD return indicates the quantity of profit (or loss) realized by an investment since the first trading day of a calendar year.

8 August 2021,Adapt your business to the new reality,"The Covid-19 pandemic has severely disrupted global consumption, forcing businesses to unlearn old practices and adopt new ones. The lockdowns have already lasted long enough in many countries to significantly change practices that had been the foundation of demand and supply.Companies hoping to emerge from the crisis in a stronger position must develop a systematic understanding of changing practices. Many firms will need a new process to detect and assess shifts before they become obvious to all. Now, a year-and-a-half after Covid-19, we are starting to see a way to restore health, businesses, economies and societies together despite the new coronavirus strain. In the face of global crisis, we need to improvise, adapt and overcome. The new normal is still emerging, so I think that our immediate focus should be to tackle the complex problems that have emerged from the pandemic by highlighting resilience, recovery and restructuringUnder a normal world, you make strategies to create and build competitive advantages and the approach to strategy assumes a relatively stable world and static landscape. With pain and sweat, you build an enduring competitive advantage by achieving scale, creating an attractive niche, or exploiting specific capabilities and resources as a business.But globalisation, new technologies, and greater connectivity and transparency have combined to upend the business environment. Sustainable competitive advantage no longer arises from brand positioning or the strength of resources. Instead, it stems from organisational abilities that foster rapid adaptation: The ability to read and act on signs of change, experimenting rapidly and frequently to maintain the position. We live in an era of uncertainty, instability and high risk demanding frequent adaptation to stay ahead of the curve. UncertaintyYour business plan is a living document that evolves with time to ensure your venture adapts and keeps pace with the dynamic marketplace. For some businesses, it has become virtually impossible even to clearly identify in what industry and with which companies they’re competing.This uncertainty poses a tremendous challenge for strategy making. That’s because traditional approaches to strategy — though often seen as the answer to change and uncertainty — actually assume a relatively stable and predictable world –I’m sure you have hands-on experience on this.The goal of most strategies is to build an enduring long lasting competitive advantage to deliver the best offering, doing what the company does well and better than competition. Managers undertake periodic strategy reviews and set direction on the basis of an analysis of their industry and some assumptions on how it will evolve. But given the new level of uncertainty, many companies are starting to ask: When change is so rapid, how can a one-year — or, worse, five-year — planning cycle stay relevant? Sustainable competitive advantage no longer arises exclusively from position, scale, and first-order capabilities in producing or delivering an offering.All those are essentially static. So where does it come from? It stems from the “second-order” organisational capabilities that foster rapid adaptation. Instead of being really good at doing a particular thing, companies must be really good at learning how to do new things. Those that thrive are quick to read and act on signs of change. They have worked out how to experiment rapidly, frequently, and economically — not only with products and services but also with business models, processes, and strategies. They have learned to unlock their greatest resource — the people who work for them. ChangeIn order to adapt to an emerging situation, a company must have its antennae tuned to signals of change from the external environment, decode them, and quickly act to refine or reinvent its business model and even reshape the information landscape of its industry. In this information-saturated age, when complex, varying signals may be available simultaneously to all players, adaptive companies must similarly rely on sophisticated point-of-sale systems to ensure that they acquire the right information. They must apply advanced data-mining technologies to recognise relevant patterns in it.  Companies need to broaden the scope of their experimentation.Traditionally, the focus has been on a company’s offerings—essentially new products and services. But in an increasingly turbulent environment, business models, strategies, and structures can also become obsolete quickly. Adaptive companies are very tolerant of failure and becoming an adaptive competitor can be difficult, especially for large, established organisations.Typically, these companies are oriented towards managing scale and efficiency, and their hierarchical structures and fixed routines lack the diversity and flexibility needed for rapid learning and change. Such management paradigms die hard, especially when they have historically been the basis for success. The speed of adaptation is a function of the cycle time of decision making. In a fast-moving environment, companies need to accelerate change by making annual planning processes lighter and more frequent and sometimes by making episodic processes continual.The adaptive approach is no universal panacea. If your industry is stable and relatively predictable, you may be better off sticking to the traditional sources of advantage. But if your competitive reality is uncertain and rapidly changing, as is true in an increasing number of industries, you need a dynamic and sustainable way to stay ahead.Your survival may depend on building an organisation that can exploit adaptive advantage. Adaptability is not just a “nice to have competency.” It is a competitive advantage for you, as an employee, leader and for your organisation – think, be convinced and make a call today to build that organisation."
17 January 2021,Trade deficit narrows in November,"Amidst a decline in earnings from exports, a number of positive developments were observed in the external sector in November 2020, including a lower trade deficit, and a notable increase in workers’ remittances.Merchandise imports continued to decline supported by the continuation of restrictions on non-essential imports and low global oil prices. There was a notable decline in merchandise exports in November compared to previous months due to disturbances to domestic production processes with the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Workers’ remittances continued to record a growth in November as well.In the financial account, foreign investment in the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recorded marginal net outflows in November 2020. The level of gross official reserves amounted to US dollars 5.6 billion at end November 2020, while the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated against the US dollar marginally during November 2020.The deficit in the trade account narrowed in November 2020 by US dollars 198 million to US dollars 565 million, from US dollars 762 million recorded in November 2019, due to a larger decline in imports compared to the decline in exports.The cumulative deficit in the trade account from January to November 2020 narrowed to US dollars 5,416 million from the deficit of US dollars 7,213 million in the corresponding period in 2019.Terms of trade, i.e., the ratio of the price of exports to the price of imports, improved by 0.6 per cent in November 2020, compared to November 2019, with import prices declining more than export prices.Overall exports: Earnings from merchandise exports suffered in November 2020 due to the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in Sri Lanka and abroad. Earnings from exports declined by 16.3 per cent to US dollars 819 million in November 2020, compared to November 2019. This was a 3.4 percent decline compared to October 2020. Measures imposed to combat the second wave of the pandemic locally, affected production in key export sectors, garments in particular.The second wave of the pandemic experienced in export markets affected demand for exports, while significant disruptions to global shipping and logistical chains also affected local businesses negatively.Industrial exports: Earnings from the export of industrial goods declined by 19.6 percent in November 2020 compared to November 2019, mainly due to the 37.2 percent decline in garment exports. Health related restrictions in factories contributed significantly to this outcome."
20 September 2020,Colombo Stock Exchange goes digital,"The digitalisation of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) will place our stock market in line with emerging markets and create a new breed of investors far and wide to unveil the untapped potential of the market, said Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) SEC Director General Chinthaka Mendis at a ceremony to mark CSE’s digitalisation last week.He said the process was complicated and there were many constraints and obstacles along the way, however, I’m happy to declare that all the regulatory and operational requirements are now in place to facilitate the new era. “What is now needed is what the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella advocates, promoting the use of digital technology, in his memoir ‘Hit Refresh’, Nadella claims that the intensity of the use of digital technology is what segregates the developed world from that of the developing world today,” Mendis said, adding that steps should be taken to increase and intensify the use of digital technology, for that matter we need to educate our people better, and we also need to teach them to invest in the stock market.The habit of making investments should be inculcated in the minds of our children from their formative age.“The SEC can no longer be restricted to its traditional role of market regulation and take the conventional approach to boost the confidence of investors. SEC has been particularly busy over the past few months, starting with the feasibility study of the entire stock market, we have been focusing on technical and regulatory reforms vis-à-vis to make our market business-friendly, particularly to make our market attractive for local and foreign investors,” Mendis said.He said the country can no longer sustain economic development at the cost of foreign debt. We don’t need to look elsewhere, this is the place to raise capital to fund the ambitious development projects of the government.“South Korean President Park picked winners from the stock market, the likes of Samsung, Hyundai and LG that had the potential and innovation to go beyond and rest is history. Similarly winners from our listed companies could be picked by looking at their potential, drive and commitment. We need to incentivize and nurture such winners, free such winning companies to go out and compete with global giants to make headway in economic development, which would change the whole complexion of our stock market that will convert us to a dynamic entrepreneurial state,” Mendis said."
5 June 2021,Thierry Henry back in business,"Thierry Henry is back in Belgium’s coaching staff for the European Championship.Belgium, the world’s top-ranked team, made the announcement on Sunday, saying Henry and the national team had “unfinished business.”The former France striker was an assistant coach for Belgium from 2016-18 and he was with the squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, when the Red Devils reached the semifinals.Thierry Henry then took the coaching job at Monaco and has since been in charge of Major League Soccer team Montreal, stepping down in February for personal reasons.Belgium begins its Euro 2020 campaign against Russia on June 12 in Group B."
22 December 2019,Govt confident of achieving high FDI,"Sri Lanka will be made an investment-friendly destination in line with the five-year development strategy of the government which aims at achieving an all time high Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), a pre-requisite to develop the economy, State Minister for Investment Promotion, Keheliya Rambukwella told the Business Observer.He said 2020 looks positive for FDIs and added that the ministry is confident of achieving a higher figure in the new year.“The objective of setting up the ministry is to drive foreign and local investments which had dried up in the past due to lack of confidence in the country and in the administration. We want to restore confidence and stability in the economy which is paramount to attract investors and build business confidence,” the State Minister said adding that already around 15 leading business personalities and top corporates in the world have shown interest in the country with investments from two alone valued at over US$ 1.5 billion. However, he did not specify the foreign direct investment target this year but said certainly the country will surpass this year’s figure in 2020 with a clear and sound program to attract FDIs to the country.The Board of Investments (BOI) officials of the former administration were aiming around US$ 1.5 billion in FDIs this year down from last year’s US$ 2.1 billion. According to statistics, foreign direct investments to the tune of around US$ 750 million had flown into the country during the first two quarters this year. Former officials of the apex body for investments pinned the blame on the 2018 October events and the April terrorist attacks on key sites in the country for the low FDIs drawn to the country this year.The BOI set a target of attracting US$ 3 billion in FDIs this year.However, the dearth of skilled workers and professionals has been a major setback to attract foreign direct investments to the country.“The US$ 1.5 billion investments this year were results of negotiations of the present government. However, we don’t want to delay investments as in the past. The one-stop shop will be a reality soon. We have no other interest other than taking the country forward and strongly believe taking loans on whatever terms will only aggravate the burden on the people and the economy but if we could manage to bring substantial investments to the country that will be the day the country would be economically stable,” Rambukwella said. He said the president clearly spelt out in the political platform that Sri Lanka will be made the destination for investments giving top priority to national security and political stability in the country and added that the ministry is focused on working out a scheme and evolving a system where investors will feel that Sri Lanka has a comparative advantage over East Asian countries that will make a difference in the minds and thinking of investors.The investment promotion ministry is looking at promoting investments in key areas such as road and highway building, power and energy sector and agri-businesses not through loans but by investments.“We will not undermining the negative impacts of development on the environment which will receive priority in our program to boost the economy,” Rambukwella said.On plans to expand the area of on all export processing zones in the country he said foremost lands allocated for investments in the zones must be fully and properly utilized and then look at expansion. Expansion is an extravaganza where as utilizing space is a sound move.When asked about the stance of the new administration on the investments to be made on an oil refinery project in Hambantota the State Minister said the project in Hambantota had been a political drama. However, we will look into it and get an overview of the real picture since an oil refiner is important for the country."
18 July 2021,CSE to review ASPI calculation method,The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has decided to revisit the method of computation of the ASPI to determine the possibility of index movements being linked to the public float (as opposed to the total market capitalisation as is current practice) of listed company constituents of the index. This would allow the ASPI to more accurately reflect the price movements of the overall stock market in relation to shares that are freely traded.The CSE will also review enforcement rules pertaining to the securities of listed companies which are transferred to the Second Board due to non-compliance with the minimum public holding requirement with the objective of discouraging such companies from remaining on the said Second Board for excessive periods of time.

2 February 2020,CSE and CIMA to strengthen collaborative efforts,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) recently to further strengthen collaborative efforts.The MoU calls for cooperation on the exchange of information and paves the way for CSE to work together with CIMA on a number of strategic initiatives.The MoU was signed at the Exchange by CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike and CIMA President and Chair of the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants, Amal Ratnayake.CSE CEO Bandaranaike said, “I welcome this important initiative which formalizes and strengthens the existing relationship between the two institutions.

30 May 2021,A PET collector’s journey amid a raging pandemic,"The importance of recycling is highlighted globally because waste has a negative effect on the natural environment. In some capacity, recycling also gives society an excellent reason to play a supporting role in keeping our planet clean. Recycling also has other benefits; one such is the economic opportunities generated through the creation of jobs.Since the 1980s, individuals and small and medium-sized businesses have created a livelihood around plastic waste collection from different industries and sectors in Sri Lanka. Since then, the country has continued to see an increase in recyclers and plastic waste collectors. According to the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) the registered number has grown from 37 in 2007 to over 230 in 2019.One such collector is Mahesh, who has created a living by collecting post-consumer plastic waste (PET and HDPE) from hotels and hospitals in Galle. He has been in the waste collection industry for ten years, which has helped him support his family, including his two children in grades 8 and 2.On a typical workday, Mahesh starts by driving his lorry to pick up plastic waste from locations in Galle. His collection trail includes gathering waste from around 40 hotels in Unawatuna and collecting plastic trash brought to him by the Army camps in Galle, Kamburugamuwa, and Boossa. He also collects the plastic trash that the Galle Harbour retrieves from the ocean and along the beaches.IssuesThough Sri Lanka has seen an increase in recyclers and plastic waste collectors, Covid-19 has presented a new set of challenges to Mahesh and his business. Currently, he collects enough PET to fill two Tata lorries because of hotel closures, equaling 1,000 kgs a month. Before Covid-19, he collected and sent four loads, approximately 2,500-4,000 kgs of PET per month, to Sri Lanka’s biggest recycler, EcoSpindles.However, issues of waste collection for Mahesh are more significant than the pandemic itself. After being in the industry for a decade, Mahesh has witnessed first-hand problems in the recycling journey, especially at the collection stage, at a household and commercial level.The increase in population, changes in consumption patterns, and lack of awareness of waste disposal are contributing factors to a poor waste management and segregation issue plaguing the country. “People dispose of all types of waste together. Waste is mixed from the hotels I collect from. Everyone must be aware of segregating it. This is because it makes life easier for collectors like myself to pick it up,” noted Mahesh.He also noted the lack of plastic waste segregation from hotels could be due to the fear staff members have with separating waste disposed by guests due to COVID-19, which has further complicated his task.Mahesh also sees the benefits of recycling because it redirects plastic waste taken to landfills and moved to recycling facilities to give it new life. Recycled PET can be turned into products such as fiber and apparel, even the 2019 ICC World Cup cricket jersey for Sri Lanka was made from waste plastic recovered from the beaches.Understanding that undisposed plastic waste across the country is a severe issue, Eco Spindles has played a significant role in growing Mahesh’s business over the past few years. To assist him further, they plan to install a bailing machine to help bail the collected plastic. Installing an on-site bailing machine will assist Mahesh as it compresses the waste, which saves space when transporting waste to recyclers from his facility.Business disruptionThe CEA has also assisted Mahesh by installing a hut needed for waste collection. “Covid has disrupted business continuity. I need to be proactive. I hope the CEA can provide additional assistance by helping me get a recycling machine that can recycle more than just PET alone,” stated Mahesh.Mahesh wants to alter his business structure in a rapidly changing environment, accelerated by COVID-19. He wants to install a molding machine to recycle other types of plastic, where he can collect items like yoghurt cups that are thrown into the environment. “If I have this machine, I can get good use from it by making products out of waste like flower pots and basins,” mentioned Mahesh.Mahesh also noted the impact COVID-19 has had on employment. In the services sector, accommodation, transport, food, and personal services reduced employment due to local shutdowns and travel restrictions imposed for local and overseas tourists. He is confident that expanding his business and collection network will provide new employment opportunities to those who lost their jobs during the pandemic in his collection business.Mahesh’s story is one among the over 200 collectors in Sri Lanka. Making sure that plastic ends up in recycling centers is more than just a job for Mahesh. He is doing his part to ensure that leftovers of our waste are recycled into new life. Echoing Mahesh’s sentiments, everyone has a role to play if we are to improve and increase recycling in Sri Lanka. "

21 June 2020,Central Bank’s responsibilities and lapses brought to light,"A robust banking landscape and a progressive stock market are two of the key pillars to measure a country’s growth and a case study for any investor before making a commitment to invest.While the stock market is making progress and functioning to the expectations in Sri Lanka, the banking sector is having ‘black scars’ with the closure of several finance companies. The lethargic attitude of the guardian of the financial landscape, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) also came in to question when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa met its decision makers.The Central Bank issues guidelines to economic development in addition to other obligations. The President said that the bank had failed to implement his policies or put forward alternative proposals.He said that the Government had put forward proposals for economic revival, but the Central Bank has neither supported it nor put forward a proposal to rebuild the economy.“The Central Bank has ignored a proposal to provide Rs. 150 billion to banks by accepting the outstanding due as collateral. The Government will have to take the blame for the economic slowdown due to the negligence of duty on the part of the Central Bank,” the President said.He said the Central Bank has not done any thing to revive the economy, despite having economists drawing high salaries. “It has been eight months since my appointment to the office and nothing has been done by the Central Bank to implement my policies. The officials who worked at the Central Bank during the bond scam still hold their positions,” the President said.The President expressed his displeasure for not receiving the cooperation of the officials who supported the bond scam to rebuild the country. While highlighting to the mandate he received from the people for the betterment of the nation, the President reiterated that he committed himself to fulfilling the aspirations of the people.He said that it is the responsibility of the Central Bank to regularise and monitor finance companies.“However, you have failed in your task. Leasing companies too evade their responsibilities. The ETI is not in a position to repay the people who invested in the company. The Finance has been closed without informing. How are we going to pay for that? There is no management there,” the President said.Former Finance Minister and parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake said that he agreed with the President on the Central Bank.He said just after the President’s meeting with the Central Bank officials, some proposals were implemented and asked why the Central Bank waited so long to implement them.The ex-Minister said the Sakwithi Finance Company had published newspaper advertisements offering over 30 percent interest for fixed deposits. “Didn’t the Central Bank officials see this and why they failed to take action,” he asked.Karunanayake said that although the Government has decided to grant loans at four percent interest to small and medium enterprises affected by the Covid-19 crisis, this has not been achieved through the Central Bank.“Certain Central Bank officials are IMF loyalists as they seek employment with IMF after they retire,” he said.“Sri Lanka is having a major issue with micro-lending. When a micro-loan scheme and Act was proposed by him to offer credit for 3 percent interest, the Act never saw the light of the day. This is because the Central Bank wants to allow financial institutions to lend people at a higher rate,” Karunanayake said.Former Central Bank Governor and Senior Economic Advisor to the Prime Minister, Ajith Nivard Cabraal said he objects to the closure of The Finance and steps could have been taken by the Central Bank to keep it running. “The Government was not updated about this closure of The Finance,” he said. Former Governor Cabraal and Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa had saved the Seylan Bank, which was on the brink of collapse, in protecting the country’s fiscal system; offered billions in saving The Finance Company; 6 billion offered at an interest of 6 percent through the Deposit Insurance Fund.A consolidation plan for the non-banking financial sector was formulated to prevent strained financial institutions from bankruptcy.The former Governor had introduced the ‘Consolidation in the Financial Sector’ in strengthening the fiscal bodies of the country between 2006 and 2014. Following government change in 2015, the consolidation program was neglected affecting financial institutions.Meanwhile, Convener of the Voice Against Corruption, Wasantha Samarasinghe has said that some Central Bank officials have even taken bribes from financial companies to say that finance companies in ‘red’ are in ‘green’ territory to the public.The bankruptcy of CIFL, ETI, The Finance and other companies did not happen overnight and the Central Bank’s Monitoring Unit should have taken precautionary measures to stop their closure. "
29 August 2021,"Testing local coconut oil, a timely step - Toxicologist","The Daily News ran a story recently that the Coconut Development Authority (CDA) has started testing local samples of coconut oil in the market to ensure quality standards and that officials have been collecting oil samples from wholesale coconut traders in Grandpass in the past few days to see if they have chemical components noting that unrefined coconut oil could contain components harmful to human health.   The CDA Chairman reportedly said this is the first time that samples refined by local factories and coconut oil produced by local manufacturers are being tested though samples of imported coconut oil are tested in labs by the Sri Lanka Standards Institute, ITI and the CDA.   The Sunday Observer asked Emeritus Professor of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology of the University of Colombo, Ravindra Fernando to tell us what the difference was between refined and unrefined coconut oil.His reply was, “An unrefined coconut oil is typically labelled “virgin” or “extra-virgin”. For example, virgin coconut oil usually has not been bleached, deodorised, or refined. Virgin oil is typically made from fresh coconuts, but processing techniques will still vary in determining the product’s quality.  The main difference between refined and unrefined coconut oil is that unrefined oil is always pure and clean and won’t include any unsafe additives, which is the best coconut oil for skin and hair. However, with refined coconut oil, evaluating the level of purity and number of harmful chemicals is essential as it has been recently stated in Parliament that about 40 percent of the unrefined coconut oil imported to the country contains toxic chemicals. He added that crude oil import should be discontinued as well. “A chemical called aflatoxin is present in coconut oil before it is refined. It is removed from the oil when refined. However, the stock that was imported contained a large amount of aflatoxin. Even if it were to be refined, the percentage of the chemical was too high for it to be completely removed from the stock,” he said. Asked to give us a better picture of what these chemicals were and how they originated he said, “Refined coconut oil undergoes some additional processing to make it better suited for cooking. It begins with pressing crude coconut oil from copra. At this step, the process may be similar to that of the dry extraction of unrefined coconut oil. Next, one or more of the following steps may occur, depending on the manufacturing process. They are degumming, neutralising, bleaching and deodorising. Finally, the oil is heat-deodorised to remove any remaining coconut scent or taste.”  Since coconut oil is traditionally one of the most popular ingredients in every Lankan household, Medi snips, inquired what adverse effects they could have on human health when ingested in food using this oil.He said, “Coconut oil might affect risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Researchers found that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (but also high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (“good cholesterol”) concentrations were elevated compared with non-tropical vegetable oils. They said that “Coconut oil should not be viewed as healthy oil for cardiovascular disease risk reduction and limiting coconut oil consumption because of its high saturated fat content is warranted.”  The organs likely to be most affected is the cardio-vascular system, he added.   Asked who were most at risk of being affected, his reply was, “People with coronary heart disease.”  CDA sources have also been quoted as warning customers not to buy coconut oil which did not carry CDA certification in future and that that only coconut oil that complies with the quality standards will be given CDA certification. Asked if he considered this to be a timely step, Prof. Fernando said, “Yes, definitely”. Commenting on the offer by the CDA to provide technical aid to local manufacturers who failed to comply to the standards, so that they could improve their quality, he said, “Yes, that is a good step.”Child pornography leaves lasting scars  As child pornography continues to be carried out with impunity despite repeated warnings by the Police and  many readers still don’t understand what exactly it means,  The Sunday Observer asked Senior Lecturer, Department of Psychiatry, University of Sri Jayewardenpura and Consultant  Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Colombo South Teaching Hospital, D Yasodha Rohanachandra to define child pornography.She said it involved, “ Any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor, such as photographs, digital photographs, videos, comics, cartoons or even drawings are considered as child pornography.” Reports of a  sudden surge in  on line child pornography in Sri Lanka with  over  17,000 video clips and photographs related to the subject said to have been uploaded to the internet from Sri Lanka between June, July this year according to Police reports, we asked her what  was  the root cause for this disturbing new trend.She said, “The Internet is a popular choice to access pornography due to the low cost and anonymity of the users. In addition, wide availability of mobile phones with cameras and facilities to upload images to the web instantly, have made it easier for offenders to collect and distribute pornographic material.”When asked if the special police unit, the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children established last month to monitor the pornographic video clips and photos related to children, and that Police also now monitor the internet constantly for pornographic content related to children, fills a long felt vacuum in protecting children, her reply was, “Yes, it is definitely a step in the right direction. This will enable early identification of perpetrators, which will minimise the harm these offenders can cause.”Asked about the psychological impacts on young girls whose parents willingly sell their children on line for sexual exploitation, she said, “The psychological effects can range from low self-esteem, difficulty in trusting others, problems with intimate relationships and sexual dysfunctions. It can also result in a range of psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders and personality disorders.” Will they leave lasting scars? We asked. To which she said, “” Yes. Majority of these children need long term psychological interventions and support to overcome these psychological effects. ”Asked if education authorities should consider introducing reproductive health in into the school curricula on how children should protect themselves from those who seek to molest them, by informing them of what to do and not to do in the presence of strangers, she said, “Integrating education in reproductive health into the school curriculum is an absolute necessity. A recent survey carried out among 14-19 years olds in Sri Lanka revealed that 31 percent of them were aware what sexual abuse meant and only 3.7 percent knew what was considered as sexual harassment. This lack of knowledge delays identification and reporting of sexual abuse.” In her final message to the public, she emphasised the role of the parents in protecting children from on line pornography. “Parents need to be aware of the risk of abuse by known and trusted people and should maintain open communication with their children so that children can come to them in case of such abuse,” she said. "

12 September 2021,Bad leaders promote gossip at the expense of profits,"Workplace jealousy and gossiping costs business organisations a colossal amount of money and the reason why it’s not considered a critical issue is that there is ambiguity around how to calculate the loss. This is a major issue in local companies.As the top most leader or leadership team member, if you accept it, promote it, tolerate it or ignore it - by design or by default you are actually making the organisation fragmented.The collaboration, coordination and cohabitation needed for organisational synergy then becomes paralysed. It ruins productivity, teamwork and creates great anxiety among managers.Jealousy in the workplace can be a damaging toxin, breeding resentment, unhealthy competition, and driving down office morale. Jealous coworkers aren’t always forthright about their envious feelings; sometimes jealousy manifests itself in the form of rumours, sarcasm, and exclusive work environments.If gossip is common in a workplace, it can negatively impact company culture. The mood and tone of gossip can cause an attitude shift that may make a company feel less harmonious. Conflicts including arguments and even physical altercations may erupt between the subjects of gossip and the people spreading the rumours.This can create turmoil within the organisation that will even impact the bottom line. Managers who gossip due to envy against people who really produce results are likely not working productively. They are interested in a rumour being circulated and may be distracted from their work and have trouble focusing on important tasks that create business value.Don’t be a breederDrafting policies that specifically forbid employees from gossiping about one another and encouraging positive communications can be helpful. Making sure that managers and supervisors act as role models and don’t feed into gossip is also an important step in preventing gossip.You know who they are -- most likely disgruntled workers who didn’t get something their way and failed to deliver, disagreed with a change of performance assessment and direction and are now holding grudges, or didn’t get that promotion they felt entitled to. This issue is bigger amongst female managers in the Sri Lankan context.Traditional female leaders enjoy such nonsense without realising the damage to business. They believe that when such undercurrent is maintained you would get to know things you would otherwise not get.Poor performers and disgruntled employees are quick to gossip, and even quicker to hammer fair leadership. Such people have an issue with performance being the only criteria to recognise people.They try to charm you with tactics to win you as a fall back. Keep a close eye on them.They spread their tumour by enlisting others into their negative spin campaign. Work productivity goes down because people are emotionally caught up in the drama like teenage kids. Watch for hush-hush chatter around work stations of disgruntled employees where those infected by gossip will stop by to “get the latest,” thus wasting precious company time.Zero tolerance policyEnact ‘zero-tolerance’ policies on workplace gossip. Set an example. Be a good role model for others to follow and don’t engage in the gossip or indirectly promote by listening to them. There is a reason why they share gossip with you.The people who listen to gossip will never be good leaders. Such leaders are weak leaders.They are not confident of themselves. They depend on others for performance.Be assertive, walk away, or change the subject when the gossip starts. The message you are communicating to others is that their behavior won’t be tolerated.Encourage managers to bring any business related issue to the table and address the perpetrators.This will take some courage, but stand up to the lead perpetrators and address them one-on-one. If you are the top most leaders or the owner of an organisation, meet with your team. Bring up the topic of gossip in an appropriate meeting to educate your team on its negative consequences – warn the worst of them.Encourage open and positive talk. Think of examples where peers and bosses can communicate to each other what they feel proud about at work. An example would be an employee going above-and-beyond in embracing change and creating real value for a business. If the gossip is about a person’s job performance, it really is none of your business unless it affects your job performance too. Maintain ‘one organisation – one team’ and not two.Ignore the gossiperGossip mongers thrive on attention and will prey on open and inviting ears.Your course of action is to be direct and tell such people “if it is something relating to business, bring it up at the right forum openly”. When the gossiper hands off the juicy gossip baton to you, if you are a professional leader don’t take it. Instead, blame it.It’s your reaction that will decide the fate of the gossip. Ask yourself why they come to you with gossip. The real issue may be you and not the gossiper. Deflect the negative gossip with the exact opposite, by saying something refreshingly positive that you perceive to be true and fair--the other side of the coin. A complimentary remark about the person being attacked will stop the gossiper on her or his tracks.

22 December 2019,The newest instrument of the bond scam cover up saga: The forensic audit,"In its series of recommendations from page 911 to page 922 of its Report, the Presidential Commission to Inquire into the Bond Scam (Bond Commission) has, inter alia, recommended as follows:“As set out earlier, there is adequate evidence before us to form the view that, there is a likelihood that some irregularities have taken place in the acceptance of Direct Placements prior to 2015.Therefore, we recommend that, an appropriate investigation be carried out to ascertain whether there were significant irregularities in the acceptance of Direct Placements by the Public Debt Department during the period 2008 to 2014 and, if so, to identify the officers of the Public Debt Department and the superior officers of the CBSL, the Primary Dealers and any other persons who were responsible for such irregularities. Such an investigation should also seek to compute the losses, if any, which may have been incurred by the Government as a result of any such irregularities. A Forensic Audit may be appropriate”.A careful examination of the above recommendations shows that what the Bond Commission Report is stating is that:There is ‘adequate evidence’ (evidence not specified) before the Commission to ‘form the view’ (not a finding, just an opinion) that ‘there is a likelihood’ (no certainty, just a possibility) that ‘some irregularities’ (irregularities not specified) have taken place in the acceptance of Direct Placements prior to 2015.Based on the above-mentioned tentative ‘likelihood,’ the Bond Commission proceeded to recommend that a ‘Forensic Audit’ be carried out to ascertain whether there were (in fact) ‘significant irregularities’ in the acceptance of Direct Placements by the Public Debt Department during the period 2008 to 2014.In this connection, it is strange that the Bond Commission has not considered the following factual certainties and not ‘likelihoods,’ in making their recommendation to carry out a Forensic Audit.(a) The Treasury Bond issues during the period 2006 to 2014 had already been subject to routine audits by CBSL’s Internal Audit Department, the audits of the ‘international’ auditors of the CBSL appointed by the Auditor General as well as by the ‘external auditors’ of the Auditor General’s Department. In addition, these Bond Issues have been closely scrutinized by the Auditor General in response to a specific request made on August 19, 2016 by the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, under Section 43 (2) of the Monetary Law Act.The Auditor General’s Report dated January 16, 2017, which reported on such specific examination, did not highlight any instances of wrong-doing that would have necessitated or demanded a forensic audit.(b) Although not available by December 30, 2017 (the date on which the Commission handed over its Report to the President), it is noted that a detailed Report dated January 30, 2018 by a CBSL Deputy Governor which provided observations on the Auditor General’s Report, had also concluded that:• During the period 1997 to 2014, despite heavy borrowing and the volatile macro-economic environment, the Public Debt Department (PDD) had been able to stabilize the Domestic Debt market by issuing Treasury Bonds and Bills through the ‘Direct Placement’ basis;• The PDD had maintained an impeccable record in its debt management processes over this period• The PDD had been highly commended for their high degree of integrity and commitment towards the delivery of their responsibilities and the development of the debt securities market• The exemplary conduct of the PDD staff had been well recognized by all market participants, as evidenced by the fact that not a single complaint of unfair treatment extended to any Primary Dealer or investor has been levelled during the period prior to February 2015,• This outcome was recognized by the Monetary Board and the top management of CBSL by giving due recognition to all Heads of Department of the PDD by promoting them to top management position of the CBSL, before 2015In addition to the earlier stated recommendation, the Bond Commission had proceeded to make the following recommendation as well:“In view of the observations made earlier in Chapter 16, consideration may be given to whether the operations and management of the CBSL prior to 2015 should be examined, particularly with regard to:(a) the reasons for the Losses incurred by the CBSL in the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, and(b) the Transactions entered into by the EPF on the Colombo Stock Exchange during the period 2010 onwards”.The Bond Commission’s recommendation to inquire into ‘the reasons for the losses incurred by the CBSL’ are totally and embarrassingly misplaced, since the main note to the Financial Statements of the Central Bank, reads as follows:“The Central Bank was established as the authority responsible for the administration, supervision and regulation of the monetary, financial and payment systems of Sri Lanka under the Monetary Law Act.In accordance with this Act, the Bank is charged with the responsibility of securing the core objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability.The basis of accountability for the Central Bank and the success of its operations therefore would be the effectiveness of its policies and operations leading towards the achievement of its core objectives and not necessarily its profitability.These statutory objectives are the fundamental features that distinguish the Central Bank from any other entity, private or public. Accordingly, profitability related approach, if adopted by the Central Bank, could result in the Bank pursuing profits while compromising its core objectives, since it has the unique ability to create its own profits through its monetary policy activities, which could influence interest rates and exchange rates. It therefore follows that the Central Bank’s objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability need to be distinguished and detached from the pure profitability objective which should essentially be incidental or academic only.”The economic results achieved by the CBSL in each of the years 2013 and 2014 have been highly successful in terms of the objectives of the CBSL. At the same time, in accordance with the Monetary Law Act, the CBSL had made substantial ‘profits’ and made healthy distributions of its surpluses to its shareholder the Government, although in terms of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) the Central Bank may have recorded ‘losses.’It is likely that this fact may have already dawned on the authorities and that is probably why they may not have pursued a ‘forensic audit’ in this connection, given the acute embarrassment of even considering such an audit, in the circumstances.In addition, the red herring raised by the Bond Commission regarding the transactions of the EPF during the period 2010 onwards has been the subject matter of a Fundamental Rights Petition before the Supreme Court initiated by 11 Trade Unions, which had been already summarily dismissed by the Supreme Court.In fact, that recommendation was strangely based upon the Bond Commission being guided by the following type of un-substantiated, un-verified and un-evaluated considerations:• “It is in the public domain.…..”• “……..is said to have been…..”• “There were allegations made in the public domain….”• “…….raised the inference of pumping and dumping and market manipulation”• “There were allegations that….”• “It has been said that….”• “This situation is said to have led…”• “It was reported that….”• “Concerns regarding these transactions were frequently raised by several members of the Civil Society…” , etc.Further, in arriving at this recommendation, the Bond Commission has referred to a ‘significant’ fall in the All Share Price Index (ASPI) in 2011, and attributed such fall to the EPF. In doing so, the Commission seems to have over-looked the fact that the entire world was undergoing a massive economic and banking crisis in 2011, and the main reason for the ‘huge drop in market value’ and the reduction in the ASPI was not the ‘transactions by the EPF,’ but the global and regional conditions. If therefore, the Commission had cared to study the behaviour of regional and global stock markets during that period, the Commission may have been spared the embarrassment of reaching this inaccurate ‘finding.’As articulated by the present Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy in the Report of the EPF for 2014, the EPF invests in a ‘portfolio basis,’ and the salient features of such basis may be best explained by using a few extracts from the judgement of Justice Sripavan (later Chief Justice) in the Greek Bonds Case of Senasinge vs Cabraal.“If all investments are maintained as risk free investments the return would be negligible. The Central Bank therefore has to select a mix of low risk and risk bearing investments expecting a reasonably high return”.“We must not forget that in complex economic policy matters every decision is necessarily empiric and therefore its validity cannot be tested on any rigid formula or strict consideration. The Court while adjudicating the constitutional validity of the decision of the Governor and Members of the Monetary Board must grant a certain measure of freedom considering the complexity of the economic activities.The Court cannot strike down a decision merely because it feels another policy decision would have been fairer or wiser or more scientific or logical.The Court is not expected to express its opinion as to whether at a particular point of time or in a particular situation any such decision should have been adopted or not. It is best left to the discretion of the authority concerned”.When reading the dicta in that case as above, it is clear that the Commission has failed to realize the fundamental nature of a ‘portfolio’ basis of investment. Sadly, it must also be pointed out that the Commission has also not appreciated the physical reality that when the Colombo Stock Market recovered in 2014, the EPF’s portfolio had recorded a massive unrealised Capital Gain amounting to Rs. 20.2 billion, as shown in the EPF Financial Statements for 2014.Such a Capital Gain proves that the Commission’s conclusions were completely without foundation, and were hopelessly erroneous, since the EPF portfolio had actually shown a ‘huge’ increase in market value by 2014, and not a ‘huge’ drop in market value as stated by the Commission.If only the Commission had cared to look into this matter further before rushing to conclusions, the Commission would have noted that the EPF’s Annual Report for 2014 contains a statement and a Performance Review by the present Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy which observes as follows:Equity PortfolioEquity portfolio which consists of both listed and unlisted equities, increased by Rs. 23.8 million (32.7 percent) from Rs. 72.8 billion in 2013 to Rs. 96.6 billion in 2014 due to new investments both listed and unlisted equities. The equity portfolio consisted of an investment portfolio of Rs. 94.7 billion and a trading portfolio of Rs. 1.9 billion at cost as at end of 2014.EPF continued to maintain a well-diversified Available for Sale (AFS) portfolio consisting of fundamentally sound companies, especially, in the sectors of Banking and Finance and Insurance, Hotels and Travels, Diversified Holding, Manufacturing, Construction and Engineering, Power and Energy and Telecommunications sectors listed on the CSE.The EPF Annual Reports for the relevant years had also shown that the Realised Capital Gains and Dividend Income during the several years was as follows: (See table above)The Performance Review of the EPF Annual Report 2014 further describes the challenges facing Risk Management, and in this regard, the ‘Overview’ and the ‘Market Risk’ paragraphs may be of particular relevance and are reproduced below:OverviewEPF is a systemically important entity in the financial sector in Sri Lanka that manages long term savings of private and semi-government sector employees with the objective of maximising retirement benefits to its members. Therefore, management of risks associated with the Fund is critically important for the members as well as for the entire financial system of the country. The EPF embraces risk management, as an integral component of its investment, operations and decision-making process.Market RiskMarket Risk is the potential of loss from changes in the market value of portfolios and financial instruments due to movements in interest rates, foreign exchange and equity prices. The market risk faced by the Fund primarily arises from interest rate risk and equity price risk.If the general interest rates of the economy were to increase, yields of Treasury bonds will follow, causing prices of bonds to drop and value of the trading portfolio to deteriorate.This is the interest rate risk faced by the Fund. However, this has been mitigated by selecting Treasury bonds of varying maturities, limiting the size of the trading portfolio and re-balancing the portfolio occasionally.The equity price risk is the reduction in the value of equity portfolio due to the decline in share prices. This is inherent risk of equity investments which has been mitigated by investing in fundamentally sound stocks with robust value. Further, the listed equity portfolio has been diversified into different sectors including Banking, Finance and Insurance, Hotels and Travels, Construction and Engineering Manufacturing and Telecommunication.Further, the market risk on the listed equity portfolio is relatively low on the overall Fund since exposure to the equity market is approximately 6 per cent of the total portfolio of the Fund as the Fund makes appropriate adjustment to its portfolio from time to time as and when necessary.In the background of the above, it is clear that the Commission seems to have accepted the allegation that the EPF has indulged in ‘pumping and dumping,’ without factual evidence, despite the Supreme Court ruling of FR Case No: 587/12 which has dealt with the identical matters referred to by the Commission. Further, the Commission seems to have also ignored or missed the massive unrealised profit the EPF portfolio had generated by end 2014, while also disregarding Justice Sripavan’s (later Chief Justice) dicta in Senasinghe vs Cabraal (SCFR 457/2012, SC Minute 18.09.2014).It is now well known as to how the CBSL top management was intimidated and coerced into withdrawing its objections to the series of ‘Footnotes’ placed by several UNP MPs to the Handunnetti COPE Report on the Bond Scam, at the insistence of ‘Temple Trees,’ the office of the Prime Minister. It has also come to light in more recent times, how the then Director General of the Bribery Commission and now Solicitor General Ms Dilrukshi Dias Wickremesinghe had been coerced into instituting legal action against certain selected individuals due to pressure from ‘Temple Trees.’ Another Solicitor General Suhada Gamlath is also on record in recent times, as to how he too had been intimidated by certain Ministers while at ‘Temple Trees’ to quickly indict certain politicians even when he said that there was insufficient evidence to do so. In addition, just a few days ago, the former Chief of the FCID Senior DIG Ravi Waidyalankara revealed how he was coerced into carrying out investigations on selected politicians and officials of the ‘Pre-2015’ era by a Unit that operated from ‘Temple Trees’ which was coordinated by a ‘politically aligned’ senior Lawyer.Meanwhile, there are already several concerns that have been expressed regarding the so-called Forensic Audits now being carried out by the Monetary Board, where suspicions have been raised that the concept of the ‘Forensic Audit’ had been skilfully planted upon the Bond Commission via a suggestion by the former Prime Minister without any data and information, so that such an Audit can (hopefully) distract attention from the massive Scams of 2015 and 2016, to shift blame to others, and to ‘buy time’ for the Mastermind.A Forensic Audit is an investigation of fraud, corruption and/or other economic crime, particularly where the integrity of senior management has been called into question. Such an Audit requires a thorough professional and independent approach, since the affected organization’s stakeholders and possibly regulators will require the reassurance of an effective and independent response, should an issue arise that poses regulatory, financial or reputational risk. Accordingly, the independence and professional basis of the effort is absolutely vital. Even in error, what the Bond Commission has recommended is a Forensic Audit pertaining to the CBSL. On that basis, if such a Forensic Audit is to be carried out, it must be carried out under the supervision and authority of an independent body or agency, and certainly not by any person connected to the CBSL or under the authority of the CBSL. It is only then that the integrity of a Forensic Audit could be ensured.In keeping with that pre-requisite, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank or any of its officers must not be involved in any manner whatsoever in drawing up the Terms of Reference, or calling for bids, or short-listing of possible Forensic Auditors, or the planning and execution of such Forensic Audits, or providing logistical support for that effort. This is particularly so, since it is the Monetary Board that has been accused by the Bond Commission as being one of the possible ‘guilty’ parties pertaining to the Scam, and/or any other misdemeanour. In fact, the Members of the ‘Post-2015’ Monetary Board are likely to be requested to account for the staggering losses and damages from February 27, 2015 to July 27, 2017 due to the voluntary abrogation of the time-tested ‘auction cum direct placement’ method of issuing Bonds from February 27, 2015 onwards, the very poor performance in Foreign Reserve Management since 2015, and the massive reduction of value of the EPF Equity Portfolio since 2015.Hence, in the interest of ‘good governance’ and avoidance of ‘conflict of interest,’ the Members of the Monetary Board and the staff of the CBSL should not have been involved in any matters connected to the Forensic Audits.However, just the opposite seems to have taken place, and according to information available, it appears that it is the Monetary Board itself that has commissioned the forensic audit/investigation, which is totally in conflict with the fundamentals of a proper Forensic Audit. In Sinhala, there is a pithy saying, that translates to: “Like inquiring about a theft from the thief’s mother!” Likewise, if the Monetary Board has been in charge of the ‘Forensic Audit,’ it would surely be a similar situation since the suspect is placed in charge of the investigation.When an external auditor to audit according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is appointed for the CBSL, such appointment is done by the Auditor General. It is not the Monetary Board or the CBSL which makes such appointment or selection. In fact, there is an extensive, transparent process which the Auditor General follows in selecting a private sector Auditor and awarding such a contract, even in the case of a routine audit.Not only has this fundamental requirement been recklessly and arbitrarily abandoned, suspicions have also mounted that certain officials of the CBSL who are known to be politically aligned towards former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his political party, are the persons who have been entrusted with the task of liaising with the Forensic Auditors. In fact, there is information that such persons are already making use of this new opportunity to shift the focus away from the real culprits and to implicate others via these Forensic Audits.The CBSL has already suffered serious reputational damage by the partisan actions of former Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri who was arbitrarily appointed as the Senior Deputy Governor and entrusted with the responsibility of ‘covering-up’ the first Bond Scam by Governor Mahendran. There is also evidence that the former Prime Minister and the former Minister of Finance attempted to absorb P. Samarasiri into the Ministry of Finance when he retired even though it was publicly known that Samarasiri was involved in the Bond Scam. In a similar manner, there is a legitimate fear that certain current CBSL officials may also be carrying out certain dubious ‘services’ on behalf of vested interests.Considering the recent revelations of the roles played by other key officials as is now being revealed by two Solicitor Generals, as well as by the former FCID Chief, the Monetary Board would do well to review their own role, as well as review the selection of the person who had been ‘coordinating’ the Forensic Audit from its own end, even though the Forensic Audit itself is a totally faulty decision.On numerous occasions, the Monetary Board has directly and/or indirectly defended the Bond Scam. It had got the CBSL Senior staff to withdraw the challenge to the COPE Report Footnotes. It supported the stance of Governor Mahendran on numerous instances when it was known he was on a mischievous adventure. It restored the old method of Bond Issues, but deliberately misled people to think it’s a new method. In particular, the role of the former Treasury Secretary, Dr. R H S Samaratunga has been highly suspicious, since he was a Member of the Monetary Board from the day the first Bond Scam took place. In fact, Samaratunga has been serving on the Monetary Board when the second Scam took place, as well. In addition, several other current Appointed Members have been in the Monetary Board when the second Bond Scam was carried out, while Governor Dr.Indrajit Coomaraswamy took more than 13 months to restore the time-tested method of issuing Bonds via the ‘auction cum direct placement’ method. Accordingly, in the interest of ensuring independence, the present Governor Coomaraswamy and the Monetary Board cannot and should not have authority to carry out or lead the Forensic Audit, because it is the Monetary Board that has been named as being directly responsible for the Bond Scam and closely associated with its cover-up.In these circumstances, almost all current Monetary Board Members are significantly compromised and may soon be even accused of being involved with the Bond Scams and/or at least involved in the ‘cover-up.’ Therefore, they cannot, in any way be placed in charge of a Forensic Audit which is supposed to be an independent investigation.Finally, it must be re-iterated that any Forensic Audit, if ultimately considered desirable, should be placed in charge of the Auditor General, and no one else. The payment for the Forensic Audit should be made to the Auditor General by the Government on a special vote, and not by the CBSL. The entire process should be handled by the Auditor General if the time honoured legal principle that “Justice must not only be done, but must also be seen to be done”, is to be followed."
15 August 2021,Military in the business of education,"“I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones” – Albert EinsteinEinstein was supposed to have answered a question about future wars using the above statement to indicate how powerful the weapons would be after the WW II. If there is going to be a WW III then most of the life forms on earth will be annihilated, and the survivors will have to start from scratch. Even though the atomic bomb, which came to be with the help of his theories, may still be the deadliest of the traditional arsenal a country possesses, the modern-day warfare is completely different from what Einstein’s generation experienced during the first two world wars.Though most of the fighting would take place in cyberspace even before a gun is fired, or a bomb is dropped, manufacturing and selling weapons will continue to be one of the biggest industries in the world. With the rapid evolution of new technologies, armies that possess the smartest weapons will undoubtedly command superiority over the others. Therefore, the security forces of the countries around the world will either, have to improve the education and training programs, or recruit people with necessary capabilities, in order to handle smart weapons effectively.National security and educationMost countries have been focusing on these aspects such as recruitment, advance training and research and development within their military establishments all in the name of “national security”. Any amount of defence spending can easily be justified since the line between war and peace is not clear at all in today’s world. Each country says: “we do not want war and we are prepared to do everything in our power to avoid conflicts with other nations. But (this is a big “but”) since we cannot predict when, or how or from what direction and mode aggression may come, we must be prepared to meet any threat ranging from an isolated terrorist act to full-scale military confrontation at any moment”.One can imagine what will happen, to the weapons industry and manpower industry where multinational corporations such as Lockheed Martin, Airbus, BAE Systems, Honeywell, Saab and Bechtel, to name a few, some with defense revenue even bigger than the GDP of countries like Sri Lanka, if all these powerful countries stayed true to their words of “avoiding conflicts”. It is not a secret that the global economy runs the way it is now thanks to all the conflicts around the world. This makes it easier for any country to justify allocating the biggest chunk of their national budget to their defense programs which include education and training of their personnel.Aspects of military educationEven though “educating the military” can be justified within this context of national security being on par with the rest of the world, it is completely different from “militarising the education”. Oxford dictionary describes “militarisation” as: “the action or process of giving something a military character”. Most of the countries have exclusive military schools and academies such as West Point Academy in New York, Annapolis Naval Academy and Colorado Air Force Academy in the US. There are additional programs where state funded universities have agreed to accommodate a limited number of military cadets under programs such as Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) partially funded by the Department of Defence.Those cadets go through their academic program with the civilian students while participating in their military training under the guidance of the ROTC office. There are private schools too in the US, established as college-prep military schools at primary and secondary levels. There are graduate schools also established by the Department of Defence for post graduate studies of the officers in the US military.The United States Military did not become arguably the best in the world by accident. Military education is also used as a tool to promote recruitment. There are about 200,000 students in ROTC programs at any given time with about 50% joining military service after graduation. Not only do they train their own military, but they also train the military officers from other allied countries including countries like Sri Lanka. Yet, they have not crossed the line to provide education to the civilian population of the country, though there is a lot of money to be made in the business of education.In addition to recruitment, military education focuses on social conformity under the guise of “discipline”. Whenever the military talks about discipline that includes obeying commands without asking questions. There is no better time or place for conditioning young minds of a nation to accept conformity as the way of life than the years they spend within the system of formal education.This, even without any involvement of the military, is already being practiced in schools in most Asian countries and in some private schools in western countries too. Students wear a uniform, and they must follow all the rules and regulations of the school or face the punishments ranging from being shouted at (verbal abuse), corporal punishments (physical abuse), all the way to expulsion (dishonorable discharge), depending on the severity of the violation and/or the mental state of the teacher (Commanding officer), who decides what the punishment should be, at that time. Students are not allowed to point out any wrongdoings of the teachers and often, they are not given a chance to present any counter arguments or at least to present the facts, if any, in their defense. If the whole class stuck together and did not reveal the perpetrator of the crime then, instead of admiring their unity and bravery, the whole class gets punished. It perhaps will not be an exaggeration to say that our schools cannot get any more militarised than that even if the Department of Defence gets the control over them.Difference in civilian educationHowever, there is a big difference in civilian higher education, where the students are given a much higher degree of freedom, while adhering to a set of rules and regulations even in countries with military style primary and secondary education systems as described above. A proper university education system should ensure the freedom of expression for students and staff alike and encourage students to engage in discussions and debates on not only the matters related to the particular subject they are learning at the time but also on matters concerning the society, the country, or the planet, in general.Universities should be able to produce people who can think on their own, not on command, and understand the problems faced by the general population and create innovative solutions. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has even launched its own Global Citizenship Education (GCED) program which plans to empower learners of all ages to assume active roles, both locally and globally, in building more peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, and secure societies. It certainly is questionable whether an education system run by a military can achieve such goals when the primary concept a military is established on is to fight the enemy, which is based on the separatist ideology of “us against them”.When the proponents of militarised education say that it is not militarisation, but they can produce well-disciplined graduates they do not see the contradiction in the fact that the discipline they refer to is conformity which kills the two most important characteristics a graduate should have; freedom of thinking and expression. Nevertheless, if the citizens of a country feel that they are better off if the military attended to all day-to-day services of their civilian needs including education, healthcare, agriculture and even running their eateries and grocery stores, during peacetime, and make no effort to find the reasons why the civilian society has failed in taking care of those needs to their satisfaction, then such a citizenry certainly deserves nothing more.The writer has served in higher education sector as an academic over twenty years in the USA and fourteen years in Sri Lanka and he can be contacted at [email protected] )"
15 November 2020,Making virtual meetings meaningful,"The business world is full of meetings and interactions under normal circumstances but now with Covid-19, it’s mainly virtual meetings to such an extent where sometimes you ask the question do I have enough time to act – how can you act effectively when the environment is closed or not as open as it used to be. Virtual meetings have become a fashion for some and the need and effectiveness are hardly measured?Covid or otherwise, purposeless meetings can be a huge waste of time.In the business world today, there are too many and they are frequently not objectively managed. You join from one meeting to another like rocket; internal and external meetings. Is there a real purpose or goal and in short no compelling reason to have so many big meetings involving so many people? It’s a big drag on everyone and on the business. Pointless virtual meetings have become the scourge of given office life, depriving companies of valuable working time and money. They are the knee-jerk response to any challenge we face at work; be it a simple people issue or an administration lapse which can be sorted over the phone or one-on -one.This doctrine results in an overwhelming number of meetings, which usually are so poorly administered and they don’t even achieve whatever they’re meant to, resulting in yet more meetings.Common mistakes made by us include; inviting people who don’t really need to attend, not having attendees prepare for the meeting, not enforcing a strict timetable/agenda for the meeting, not having clarity around the purpose of the meeting, letting the conversation veer off topic or allowing the discussion to become disorganized, not ensuring that all views are voiced, heard and considered.Meetings can either be very successful making those involved feel part of a team or they can be disastrous, leaving everyone present feeling confused and frustrated.Right toneDid you know that setting the tone is more important than the words you say in a virtual meeting? To make the most of your meeting it is important to put some thought into what the meeting is supposed to accomplish, who should attend, what should be discussed, how to stay engaged, where the best place to have it is, and when would be the most convenient date and time- and what technology platform to use.Having decided on the basics, equally important is how the meeting is chaired. If you are the chair, ensure that you get online early. Greet everyone warmly and ensure that everyone is comfortable and able to pay attention without distractions.Use your opening remarks to set the tone for the meeting, ensure everyone is in attendance, establish the purpose and then review the agenda. Give a short overview of each topic and what you need to achieve at the end of the meeting. During the meeting, it is important to pay attention to the structure of items based on priority. For example, a step by step approach to problem solving encourages people to develop and evaluate alternative solutions. Without this, the meeting can dissolve into a free for all with the strongest voice dominating; or no ideas being generated; or the item being put on hold until the next meeting. Mind you; running a virtual meeting demands more skills than running the face to face meeting. It’s an art that you need to develop thru practice. CommitmentsMeetings – whether virtual or otherwise, are meant for making decisions and finding solutions, not for ranting, griping or dwelling unnecessarily on problems. Always make sure, every agenda item ends with a decision and clear to-dos including responsible people and dead-lines.Any verbal exchange can easily go from good to great if you know how to set the overall tone from the start. The most important aspect of effective verbal communication during a meeting is to respect the other people’s time. State this at the very beginning of the meeting to set the tone that you want to get down to business and not waste their precious time. Ensure that you connect with as many people as possible so the people will stay on alert. Haven’t you been in virtual meetings where lots of decisions are made but nothing gets done and nobody is held accountable? Unless you finish the meeting with commitments about “who will do what by when,” you’ve just built 90% of a bridge. Take a stock of all the regular virtual meetings you have, do a look back and decide which ones are really necessary, which ones add value vs wasting time. We all have accountabilities though its work from home – so be more committed than ever before and do justice for the role you play for the business. "
23 February 2020,Apparel exporters keen on new business model ,"Highlighting the need to introduce a relatively new model of business which will enhance offshore activities, the Sri Lanka apparel industry called for a number of measures including electronic documentation, e-commerce mechanisms and law reforms from the Government.“These measures are important to boost the industry locally and internationally. The industry has an ambitious target of US $ 8 million in export turnover by 2025, which is double the present performance. Therefore, an improved environment is necessary to move forward,” Chairman, Sri Lanka Apparel Exporters Association, Rehan Lakhany told the Annual General Meeting of the Association in Colombo recently.“Our confidence levels have improved considerably, and there is hope that the new administration will ensure a proper delivery of decision-making on policy, and action with time-bound implementation plans. The environment will further improve with political stability after Parliamentary elections this year,” he said.Recalling that the industry faced a destructive environment in 2019 due to domestic political and global issues, and the indecisiveness in decision-making due to “differences between the Legislature and the Executive”, he said that the Government should focus on broadening supply bases locally and regionally.“This could be done through the offshore management of total supply solutions in collaboration with a regional producer and subcontracting mechanisms. With the framework in place, exporters could create a new flow of export earnings, which could approximately amount to an additional $ 300 million from our sector alone,” he said.The relatively new model of business should be encouraged by the Government by revisiting current tax provisions. The Joint Apparel Association Forum Sri Lanka (JAAF) has already made submissions in this regard.Speaking about B2C transitions, he said that a major issue faced by the industry was the absence of a mechanism to receive payments online. The Government should create a mechanism similar to PayPal for this purpose, he said.There was also a need for a change of regulations, especially in relation to electronic documentation, and the need for the Finance Ministry to take responsibility for this was highlighted. While saying that there was a need to develop local markets, the SLAEA Chairman said international market penetration was a priority, and commented on Sri Lanka’s Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), saying they are not providing enough market access to the industry.He proposed the continuation of the trade dialogue that commenced in 2013, and added that GSP+, the only available scheme, was not fully used.“Ony 47% is used, even though we could have claimed 98% if we could meet the country of origin rules,” he said, bringing up the issue of Sri Lanka depending on other sources for raw material. It is for this reason that the move to establish a textile manufacturing zone in Eravur in the Eastern Province is a welcome move.While the technical feasibility studies have been completed, Lakhany said they expect the Government to develop the infrastructure. “If the completion of the project can be done in one year, we can guarantee that a minimum of three projects will be set up,” he added. Focus was also brought on Brexit and the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union (EU), saying that it would be another challenge the industry will have to face following UK’s transition period.“We feel that trade dialogue should be directed towards preferential arrangements with the EU and the UK on a high priority basis, followed by the recommencement of negotiations with China and India,” he said, adding that within the Asian region, Japan was also an important market.Commenting on how Brexit would affect Sri Lanka in terms of GSP+, British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Sarah Hulton said the UK was looking forward to new opportunities for Sri Lanka and the UK, “Using bilateral trade as an engine for sustainable growth for the mutual prosperity of both nations.”The UK was the second largest importer of Sri Lankan goods, and that 30% of all apparel exports to the EU go to the UK. However, the apparel industry will continue to be a key sector of focus in UK’s trade investments, she said.“This is an opportunity to reassure you that Sri Lanka will continue to benefit from the same level of access on its exports to the UK that it currently received through GSP+ during our transition period this year,” Hulton said. She added that all countries that are beneficiaries will continue to be beneficiaries of the EU GSP scheme and will continue to enjoy these preferential tariffs through a UK trade preferential scheme.“The UK Government has now launched a four-week consultation on a new UK most favoured nation tariff schedule, which will come into being on January 1, next year,” she added."
2 May 2021,Chrissworld confident of business growth,"The Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Chrissworld Limited on the CSE which opened on April 27  was oversubscribed on the same day itself. This is a distinct IPO as it is the first company to be listed on the Empower Board of the CSE.(This interview was conducted before the IPO).“Though most SMEs will still shy away from listing, due to various reasons, we thought of taking up the challenge, since it was a super opportunity to create a positive image of the Company in the industry,” said Chrissworld Ltd. Chairman Christo Perera in an interview with Sunday Observer Business.Excerpts: Q: Tell us something about Chrissworld Ltd. Its role and journey since initiation?A: Becoming a Public Listed Company was never a consideration when Chrissworld was incorporated in 2013, but we were absolutely confident that focusing our energies to develop the Company’s core business of warehousing, was going to put us right there with the big boys.Our growth has been primarily centered on our confidence and belief in ourselves, that we can deliver positive results, whatever the challenges.We started off with a 30,000 sq. ft. warehouse with zero cargo volumes and not a single client commitment. Within a couple of months, we were at maximum capacity and it’s been in growth mode ever since.Nature almost wiped us off in 2016 with major flooding in Colombo destroying our entire capacity of 100,000 sq ft resulting in the loss of all our clients, but with resolve and determination to survive, coupled with a great team effort by our people, we raised ourselves from the depths to develop the company to where it is today, with a strong customer base spread across 500,000 sq ft of warehousing in 13 locations.Q: What were the main reasons behind the decision to list on the CSE?A: Firstly, the opportunity given for SME’s to list was an attraction, whereas previously only the large-scale enterprises were considered for listing.Though most SMEs will still shy away from listing, due to various reasons, we thought of taking up the challenge, since it was a super opportunity to create a positive image of the Company in the industry.Seeing the tremendous potential in this business, it was important to project ourselves as a stable and professional company to give us an advantage to win the confidence of future clients.Second, logistics is a capital-intensive business and fast growth requires capital in hand to ensure every opportunity to develop is not missed out.We have had instances where our clients have requested for additional warehouses at short notice. It is a request we should not refuse. Divesting a part of the shareholding to the public is an opportunity to raise required capital in the form of equity than borrowing from banks and other financial institutions.Third, it gives us satisfaction that we have contributed in at least a small way to increase activity in the stock market and that society could reap results from our success.Last but not least, after having understood the control and monitoring mechanisms involved in a listed Company, we felt it was necessary for us to take our Company in the path of good governance, which would also lay the foundation for us to go for bigger plans in later years.Q: Do you believe the tax relaxation provided by the Government was attractive to take the decision to be listed?A: This was not a factor for our decision. However, we appreciate the benefit and accept it with open arms. We are surprised that the newly listed SMEs are given a 50% tax benefit only in the 1st year and the current applicable tax rate of 14% is reverted to thereafter, whereas the larger categories are to enjoy a tax rate of 14% for a full three-year period. Therefore, the tax benefit in its current context is not a real attraction which prompted us to list.We are hopeful that the capital market regulators and policymakers would correct this situation in the upcoming budget so that SMEs would also gain the benefit of tax incentives when a listing is obtained in the CSE.Q: As the first Empower Board Listing, could you share your experience in the listing process?A: As reiterated before, obtaining a listing in the CSE was never in our agenda until we were approached by Atarah Capital Partners, an approved “Sponsor” firm of the Colombo Stock Exchange. They are the Managers to the IPO of the upcoming listing.The decision to list was only taken in October 2020, however we commenced engagement with Atarah Capital Partners way back in 2019 and deserves credit to them for offering the right advice on certain restructuring initiatives to strengthen our Balance Sheet, and also certain measures to improve corporate governance.The demands of the listing process were never a hindrance to us since Atarah Capital Partners with extensive capital market industry and Regulatory experience was able to successfully handle the listing application process, obtain regulatory approvals from both SEC and CSE and also prepare a Prospectus and a Research Report for us.Q: Who will be the Registers to the issue?A: The Registrars to the Issue is the Central Depository Systems (Pvt) Ltd, widely known as the CDS. They were recommended to us by Atarah Capital Partners and we are confident that CDS would carry out the tasks successfully.Q: On par with the listing process, did the company have to make changes to the present organisational structure?A: Yes, there was a slight structural change, but it was limited only to the Board of Directors. We had to bring in two Independent Directors to meet the regulatory requirements as a listed Company. We also appointed Suraj Suraweera, who is a part of our pioneering team, as the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, and who is probably one of the best in the industry.Having said that, Chrissworld even as a private Company has always been run professionally and with a lot of discipline. Our career beginnings in listed Companies have tattooed disciplined management in us and taught us the importance of being fully focused on this. Thus, it is not a major shift in policy or style of management for us.However, we will always be cautious in our forward journey. Many private companies have gone bankrupt due to the Directors and shareholders amassing individual wealth and extravagant lifestyles, at the expense of the Company. Similarly, even listed Companies run into disaster due to high risk initiatives and ill planned expansion. We wish to tread carefully and ensure long term sustainability and steady returns for our shareholders.Q: What are the company’s plans for growth and expansion in terms of projects and initiations, with the funds that Chrissworld Ltd will attract from the Stock Market?A: The prospectus provides in detail on how the IPO funds will be used. The main focus would be to upgrade our facilities and services by introducing new racking, new material handling equipment and add a warehouse Management System. These measures will bring very positive results in business growth.On paper, we are not showing fancy results, since we firmly believe in the principal of Under Promise and Over Deliver. In fact, we are forecasting single digit growth rates over the next couple of years, which is still a good forecast, but we are extremely confident that we will achieve far beyond our targets.We will strive to expand our verticals and introduce several new revenue streams in the future, whilst we look at how to make use of technology to support all our plans.Our aim is to take this company to a billion rupee top line as a first step and be acknowledged as a world class service provider with a distinct style. We are a different Company indeed.Our culture, our flexibility, our hands-on involvement and our intense desire to serve our clients well, all this with not much fanfare and publicity, has been our distinct features and has worked well for us thus far.Q: What is your Mmessage to other Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) who hope to list on the Stock Market?A: Be fearless and take the challenge to make use of this opportunity of listing in the CSE and use the alternative source of raising equity capital for your company via channeling savings of the public. Debt Capital via Banks and Finance companies should not be the only source of capital for your businesses.The thousands of calls and messages we continue to receive from all over the world appreciating our decision is a testimony of how others perceive this move.It is an opportunity to take your brand to a different level and to raise the bar of management. If your current internal controls are disciplined and you have proper financial management in place, this is not a huge challenge whatsoever."
24 January 2021,Social media engagement in marketing,"Last year was a nightmare for marketers all over the world including those in Sri Lanka. With trade activities down the lowest due to constant lockdowns and stringent health restrictions, the companies were forced to either completely shut down or downsize operations to a great extent. Health issues emerged due to the pandemic compelling budget cuts and curtailing in-store shopping in every country in the world.Evidently, Sri Lanka’s scenario was better than many countries in the world at the initial stages, until the renewed second wave surfaced in October last year. Till then Sri Lanka maintained its position as one of the highest-rated pandemic controlled countries in the world.The irony was that business was rapidly normalising and the trade activities, particularly the retail trade, were almost on the verge of full recovery by early October last year. Marketing activities were also gearing up to start advertising and promotions campaigns when the second wave emerged suddenly. With the resurfacing of the Covid-19 in several variants and with dangerously enhanced strength, this year also will be unpredictable to marketers. The trends will also be irregular and uncertain in many ways. Hence, the marketers in Sri Lanka will be forced to adopt different strategies and innovative alternatives to sustain the business.Change in focusCovid-19 has changed the focus of people across the world in communication. From the beginning of the outbreak, people relied on social media platforms to stay in touch with each other due to lockdowns. Widely used platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become a necessity to maintain relationships with families and with work as well. The emergence of the virus has hastened the digitalisation of commercial communication faster than ever before.Social media has been used to market and sell products for some years. However, the use of social media will be compulsorily necessary for this year. Customers are already getting used to exploiting social media platforms to obtain information about the products or services they want to purchase. Individual or business advertisements have become an easy way to buy or sell products or services. Also, the ongoing system allows them to directly purchase through Facebook and some other platforms.  For example, all you have to do is to publish a post on Facebook to buy and sell any type of product or service. The result is amazing with offers, information, advice, or recommendations. Plenty of places that sell or buy such products or services will respond, most of the time instantly. Depending on the number of contacts in the account, the response also can become thicker. According to the statistics, internet use in Sri Lanka has increased by an astonishing 4.1%  (nearly 400,000 connections) between 2019 and 2020, marking a clear increase due to the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. Similarly, the usage of existing social media stands at 6.1 million has been increased by 8.3% with nearly 500,000 new users between April 2019 and January 2020. The mobile connections in Sri Lanka stood at staggering 31.8 million connections, (more than the population of the country) with an increase of 7.5% with 2.2 million new connections. Of the 6.2 million social media users, 92%  (5.5 million) of them access social media platforms through mobile phones, according to surveys. This figure indicates the impact mobile connections can do on social media marketing in Sri Lanka.  IncreaseAccording to market information, almost every platform has gained increases in use since the outbreak of Covid-19 early last year. Particularly, Facebook has revealed that the increase in usage is 70% for the past few months. Many marketeers in Sri Lanka and the world have pulled back from traditional channels and engaged themselves in social media to sustain business revenues. Marketeers are concentrating more on social media due to the sharp increase in usage that enhances the impact on customers.      Social media has now become the core of marketing in the present volatile situation where masses depend heavily on online communication, predominantly on social media. It is revealed that an average person spends a minimum of an hour a day on popular platforms such as Facebook, Youtube, Watsapp, or Viber, making marketing in social networks a must. This provides marketers not only target audiences but also far better reach for advertisements instantly.  The social media platforms allow the marketeer to engage its subscribers or gain new followers with efficiently and creatively crafted posts to promote a product, service, or brand. Also, unlike conventional media, the posts can be edited and the contents can be changed within minutes with fresh ideas or news or images as required. Social media is the most popular catchphrase in internet marketing at present. The success of the new generation of social media platforms and new channels of digital channels have taken over the efficiency of advertising to a great extent due to reasons such as cost efficiency, speed, reach, and ease of operating.  Social media advertising also offers an opportunity to include images created to suit the target audience. The images, whether graphics, photographs, or downloads, help the advertisement to gain more attention.Unlike offline advertising, social media creations have more freedom to include several images in an advertisement, if it’s not cluttered. Another advantage of social media marketing is the optimisations of social setup where the reach can be maximised to obtain more mileage. By monitoring the response closely, the advertiser can gain important information on competitors. The monitoring can be easily done daily through software programmes and keep a tab on daily progress etc.The Covid-19 will likely stay put for an indefinite period even with several vaccines rolled out in several countries. Companies understand that social media is the best solution to communicate with their audiences effectively. The companies need to focus on best practices and adhere to them during the crisis. The selected strategies can be incorporated to support the engagement even when the pandemic is subdued eventually.Most effective In this unstable situation, social media is perhaps  the most effective and most reliable way to contact the customers with ideas, comments, suggestions, or even questions about the business and the products.  By posting meaningful content, even about important information and guidance on the pandemic, the messages can be effective and engaging. In social media platforms, the best practices continue to evolve. However, now that society has grown accustomed to the new social media engagement, the standards are changed. Businesses attempt to show the audiences that they are there to help.The contents of the message speak of the commitment to the protection and welfare of the society at large. Quarantine practices have affected the media habits of people tremendously. Average social media engagement has increased several folds and if the marketeers play their cards intelligently, the mileage that can be achieved will be enormous.  "
26 September 2021,Effective crisis management for business recovery and growth,"The Covid-19 pandemic that has swept through the world since late 2019 created an acid test to all communities, political leaderships, and businesses, in a world upturned. In the light of the huge challenge, organisations throughout the world started looking for answers to confront the gruesome situation. The unprecedented pandemic has placed unparalleled demands on businesses and their leaders, and beyond. The humanitarian toll has created immensely damaging fear psychosis among employees and other stakeholders. The magnitude of the outbreak and its utter unpredictability produce a tremendous challenge to businesses and decision-makers throughout the world. A ‘Washington Post’ analysis revealed that 45 out of 50 biggest US companies thrived during the pandemic period. It was a common phenomenon in many other countries as well, including Sri Lanka. The reason perhaps is that the larger organisations applied crisis management methods as soon as the pandemic broke out. Several business leaders have revealed that they were prepared for a crisis long before the emergence of the pandemic and they were able to face it successfully in a business context.  ResponseIn Sri Lanka, most of the small and medium-scale organisations were not fully aware of the subject of crisis management. Therefore, the decision-making may have been slow and less effective, at least at the beginning. A well-known, top rung business leader in a television program recently divulged that they were prepared for such a crisis and applied the predetermined methods to face the challenge, immediately after the breakout.What is crisis management? Investopedia describes that crisis management refers to the identification of a threat to an organisation and its stakeholders in order to mount an effective response to it. They say that even the best-managed businesses can be hit by a crisis caused by external or internal events. Crisis management, therefore, is a strategy of anticipating crises in businesses and planning how to manage them effectively.Modern organisations attempt to identify potential crises before they occur and sketch out plans to face or counter them. It does not have to be a specific and precise emergency, yet if or when it occurs, the organisation is prepared to act and change course if required.   Any type of business, large or small, may run into crises that negatively impact the normal operation. These situations can come in many forms such as natural disaster or manmade disaster, breach of information, demise or incapacity of a leader, civil unrest, or health calamity such as Covid-19. Any of these situations can lead a business to fail or even bankruptcy if the crisis is not managed efficiently.  The coronavirus pandemic that has impacted the world in a big way since January 2020 is one such mega-crisis and has become a textbook example of crisis management. Businesses around the world were compelled to close down; millions of workers lost jobs, essential services were disrupted, world trades were affected extremely negatively due to multiple reasons.RecoveryThose businesses that adjusted themselves by using crisis management practices are the fastest to recover according to the information available. Businesses that deployed contingency to mitigate the negative event with continuity plans and action succeeded and perhaps improved revenue during the crisis.  Even if a company has no pre-strategised crisis management plan, the leaders’ prompt understanding of a suddenly emerging crisis is imperative. Witnessing slow-developing situations and acting swiftly without normalcy bias and without underestimating the challenge can prepare the organisation to overcome a bad situation.  A crisis situation is different from a routine emergency and cannot be responded to similarly. Most often crises arise with unfamiliar and uncertain conditions. Therefore, the counter-actions must be largely improvised, perhaps with a wide range of temporary moves or adjustments. Some of the adjustments may be beneficial in the long run even after the emergency has passed.   Crisis management since the breakout of the Covid-19 was merely reactionary to many organisations in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan entrepreneurs, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, have not experienced a crisis of this magnitude previously. Hence the reaction and response naturally were based on their limited experience and without any scientific basis. Hence, the preventive measures were mostly inadequate. Effective crisis management has the potential to largely and significantly reduce the scale of damage the organisation has to bear in a crisis. Therefore, a good knowledge of various models and developing methods of crisis control can be exceedingly useful in time to come. Understanding warning signs of a crisis before it occurs is important to a business. The first step is to prepare for possible negative impacts. When the signs of a crisis appear, preparing with a proactive approach and planning to modify, amend or adjust the existing system with possible brainstorming can produce results when the crisis actually hits. Not complexCreating a response plan is not a complex process. The leaders of businesses are familiar with the operation and can contribute immensely to a simple crisis response plan. The operational and communication components must be clearly defined and delivered to the stakeholders effectively with credibility.  Communication in a crisis is one of the most important tasks of management. Delivering the message about the plan of action to those who are identified in the initial crisis control plan quickly is critical. In an emergency swiftness of response is crucially important. If the business is with a large customer base, identifying an effective communication team is vital. A small selected team of executives can deliver the required responses to the situation to those who are outside the business effectively and productively.    However, the impact of an unexpected crisis is more extensively damaging for small and medium-sized enterprises. If not managed promptly and efficiently, the crisis may wear down trust, destroy organisational values, threaten business agendas and goals, exert undue pressure on ownership, and may even lead to complete business failures.    Therefore, the leadership approach of an SME is critical in a crisis. The efficiency of nippy decision-making and effectiveness of teamwork is the top priority of an organisation. As mentioned earlier, internal and external communication effectiveness is also another extremely important element during a crisis for SMEs. Small business owners think that their small operation is simply too minute for a crisis. Nevertheless, Covid-19 breakout amply displayed that such complacency opens gaps during a crisis. For example, at the initial stage, everyone assumed that coronavirus will be confined only to a region and will fade away in a short time. That was not so and the businesses that took it marginally seriously suffered. In contrast, the large companies with ready-made crisis management plans with survival strategies remained as is or grew their businesses more. The smaller organisations underwent many hardships during this period. Most often, the crisis plans of SMEs were formulated later than required.The more important factor is that small business owners usually have additional responsibility due to the volatile nature of their business with comparatively limited resources than large organisations. Therefore, being confident in their business in an emergency is vitally important. The good leadership behaviour and approach of an entrepreneur at a critical time is transferred down to the staff to boost them up.   Competency in managing is another main element of crisis management, both for small and large organisations. Proactive, confident, and intelligent moves towards the internal and external resources can be exceedingly productive. Also, being compassionate towards all stakeholders is vital. In a crisis, if the empathy of the leaders can give the extra mile to an organisation as the others are more likely to listen to the message of such a leader.    It is important to remember that crisis management is an ongoing process. Continuous improvement by applying learned lessons can minimise the risk next time around. Therefore, organisations should endeavour to enhance resilience and renewal strategies to recover fast from any possible future disastrous event.  "
21 March 2021,Ceylinco Life launches program to support entrepreneurs,"Ceylinco Life has launched an entrepreneur development program ‘Viyaparika Athwala,’ which will be conducted islandwide to support the aspirations of business people, in the backdrop of the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.Loosely translating to ‘A hand to business’ the program will consist of a monthly seminar focusing on motivational as well as behavioural aspects that can help entrepreneurs better manage their businesses as well as their work-life balance, the Company said.The first workshop under this initiative was held in Kandy recently. At the helm of the event was motivational speaker Udaya Devamulla who addressed the audience on goal setting and overcoming obstacles.Ceylinco Life has planned 12 such programs for the year ahead, all of which will include addresses by key resource personnel on topics such as goal setting, handling obstacles and overcoming problems, living a healthy and active life, health tips, and best practices in health screening.Ceylinco Life Managing Director Thushara Ranasinghe said, “Besides promoting a positive and well-balanced approach to business, we hope the program will also encourage entrepreneurs to pursue their ambitions with confidence. ‘Viyaparika Athwala’ will also provide a platform to create awareness among busy and ambitious entrepreneurs on how life insurance can help them to work towards and achieve goals and dreams, by providing the peace of mind needed to work towards personal and career goals."
23 February 2020,Assistance for Small and Medium Enterprises,"The SME sector which contributes around 50 percent of the GDP and accounts for around 90 percent of the businesses in Sri Lanka has been identified as a vital sector to boost growth and social development. Access to financing has been a key obstacle for SME entrepreneurs to get started and move on to the next stage of business. Much has been spoken about funding the sector and many lenders have extended a helping hand but the problem still persists due to collateral based lending which is an impediment for the sector.Lack of institutional support and policy inertia too have further reduced the potential contribution of SMEs to the economy.A task force comprising business people, members of Chambers and Industry, members of the academia, bankers and government officials was set up by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to develop a policy framework for SME development in Sri Lanka. Sunday Observer Business spoke to Sanasa Development Bank (SDB) Chairperson Samadanie Kiriwandeniya and COSMI President Nawaz Rajabdeen to seek their views regarding the moratorium on loans taken by SMEs Blanket moratoriums could be counterproductiveThe assistance extended to Small and Medium Sector (SME) enterprises by the Government by way of low interest loans and moratoriums on repayment to those affected by the Easter attacks is a good move, but blanket moratoriums could also be counterproductive without a long term strategic plan to help the sector which is vulnerable to internal and external shocks, said Sanasa Development Bank (SDB) Chairperson Samadanie Kiriwandeniya.She said concessions for SMEs are crucial to develop the sector but in opening up relief programs such as the ones extended to those affected by the April attacks, should be well thought out to ensure the neediest benefit.If not, even those who do not need assistance could get on to the bandwagon to gain undue benefits.“Extending moratoriums to all could affect banks and financial institutions that would make them reluctant to provide concessions to all in the sector.Banks and the financial sector can be affected if loans are written-off and these institutions could be compelled to charge from customers to make up for the concessions. Banks and lending institutions should be given the discretion in granting relief to SMEs,” Kiriwandeniya said.“Looking at the external environment, there is no clear path for the SME sector to grow due to the constantly fluctuating policies when governments change. There needs to be a consistent national framework.The best way to groom the sector is to connect the sector with upper level businesses in the value chain,” Kiriwandeniya said, adding that building market links and supporting them in the value chain are essential to develop a vibrant sector.With regard to the role of the SDB in SME development, Kiriwandeniya said the bank works with micro entrepreneurs in the rural sector to help them have organic growth.The bank helps SMEs to connect with market suppliers. It provides training to entrepreneurs of the sector and has groomed the staff to look at cash flows rather than focusing too much on securities in granting loans to the sector.“Sanasa International, an entity of SDB, conducts a pilot project with Canadian assistance to provide value chain financing,” Kiriwandeniya said.The sector has gained recognition as a major source of employment, income generation, poverty alleviation and regional development in the agriculture, mining, manufacturing, construction and service sector industries.However, despite the various policy reforms and support programs by the private sector, the SME enterprises are less dynamic and underdeveloped compared to its sector in the region,such as South Korea, China and India.SMEs play an important role in promoting inclusive growth. It is estimated that Sri Lanka has over 500,000 SMEs, each employing around three to five persons on average. Relief package, a welcome moveThe Government’s approach towards this most important economic sector is encouraging and with an effective support structure, the country will have far reaching benefits in the long run, President, Confederation of Micro and Small Industries (COSMI), Nawaz Rajabdeen said.“We welcome the measures taken by the Government to revive the SME sector which is a vital component of the economic drive. As the sector faces severe financing difficulties, the relief package introduced by the Government is a welcome move. Many enterprises are crippled due to the lack of capital and adequate resources to sustain and expand ventures to become a sizable operation.The Government’s proposed rebate scheme which also includes providing Rs. 300 million as working capital with concessionary repayment terms is an important decision to boost the capacity and abilities of ailing enterprises which are starved of funds. The tax reduction in terms of VAT and simplification of the tax system is a move in the right direction.While appreciating the Government’s efforts to stimulate the growth of the SME sector, we urge the Government to reconsider the timeline given for the enterprises to meet the requirements. Though, the Government extended the deadline from end January to end February, we feel that time is not sufficient to provide all the documentation necessary to process the facilities as it takes considerable time to produce proper documentation.Therefore, we propose that the Government should further extend the period given to submit the application until end of June to enable a large number of enterprises to seek the support given by the Government. It is not only the enterprises, but the banks also need time to study the documents, including rhe financial performance and collateral furnished and this is a detailed process requiring considerable time.It is also necessary to lay emphasis on the SMEs operating in the North and the East to which minimal attention have been paid over the years. These enterprises are in dire straits without access to funding and supportive structure to perform. As there are a large number of micro and SMEs in the region it is important to address their long standing issues in going forward.The State banks have been called upon to support the Government debt relief package effectively to achieve the end results. However, due to lack of awareness about this facility, it is not very popular among enterprises. This highlights the need for credit awareness and this message should go to the regions for the sector to benefit .Overall, the Government has done a tremendous job in addressing the long overdue issues in the SME sector and it is hopeful that these measures will continue until a vibrant economic segment is created. This has given the confidence for the sector to continue and grow their businesses.”"
22 November 2020,Digital media inevitable for post Covid-19 business,"More than ever in recent history, digital media platforms have become the principal source of information, both in business and individual lives. The world has identified digital media as the best vehicle to face the challenge of the current volatile business environment created by Covid-19. Particularly, social media has become enormously useful.Most large scale business operators in Sri Lanka have already turned toward digital platforms. Nevertheless, small and medium scale entities are yet to introduce technology to their businesses. Even established small and medium businesses are at a disadvantage in the market as large operators eat into their share by communicating through new media. Today, businesses wrestle with plummeting profits and protecting staff health due to the risk of Covid-19.Hence, the key is to focus on digital transactions, not only in marketing functions but also in other purposes such as using cashless payments and work from home methods as well.Electronic contents are faster than any other medium available. Sri Lankan business fraternity also is recognizing the importance of going digital. Especially after the appearance of the pandemic in March this year, many of them did not have much choice than adapting to social media. Covid-19 has acted as a catalyst for this adoption.Digital marketing is fast becoming the most essential tool in future marketing functions. Traditional media will likely be entirely replaced by the new digital methods in marketing. Sri Lankan urban and suburban society, with over six million active social media users, has already turned to search and compare products through the internet.Therefore, companies have no alternative other than using new media for promotions. Digital media offer many alternatives and choices for marketing communications. Also, digital platforms are more practical and versatile than conventional methods.Websites with unlimited information capacity, online advertising, e-marketing, pay-per-click, social media advertising, and mobile marketing are some of the choices a company can choose from. Small and medium scale companies often operate with restricted budgets.With new media, their burden can be pruned down by large margins due to the low costs of digital applications. Besides, the advertiser can reach an enormous number of potential customers by using social media. The advertisers have the luxury of choosing their own target audiences with breakdowns such as age, social conditions, geographical areas, or professions. Such a feat cannot be achieved with traditional media. With the grueling competition prevailing in the market at this crucial juncture and confusing post-Covid impact, getting ahead of completion is important.Establishing credibility and gaining the trust of the customer is the key factor for success in this tough situation. Strategically important feedback and testimonials from customers can easily be obtained through digital marketing. Good recommendations from customers can go a long way. Most often potential customers believe and consider this feedback from existing customers when they purchase.The pandemic has brought the importance of technology into the limelight. Businesses have more effective alternatives through technology. Through various digital channels, companies can conduct meetings through video, issue instructions to a group of people through WhatsApp, Viber, or other similar messaging applications, conduct training sessions, and virtually run an operation productively.Easy access and availability allow workers to enhance functionality more conveniently than they would be in person. Companies need to transform to digital media not only to minimize the Covid-19 impact but also as a more viable future model for business. "
22 November 2020,SLASSCOM launches Global Referral Program to boost exports,"SLASSCOM launched its Global Referral Program recently. It is aimed at increasing export revenue for IT and BPM companies by connecting them with business opportunities via a global network of channel partners and influencers.Chairman, SLASSCOM, Channa Manoharan said, “Supporting our companies to make inroads into key markets is a key priority of SLASSCOM. The referral program was initiated upon the insight that there are Sri Lankans living and working across the globe who are willing and able to connect Sri Lankan companies with prospective business opportunities.”The Board Director representing the Marketing Forum, Shiraz Lye said developing export business and partnerships through Sri Lankans living overseas has been successfully tried and tested by few member companies.“With insights and lessons learnt, we have formalised the Global Referral Program to scale up and benefit more of our members to get new export business to the sector. We will be collaborating with the Sri Lanka High Commissions in key markets along with support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Commerce, the Board of Investment, the Export Development Board, and the ICT Agency of Sri Lanka,” he said.SLASSCOM Marketing Forum Head Mudith Uswatta said the referrers will play an active role in promoting the company’s products and services of companies in the programme who will primarily consist of Sri Lankans living overseas and other foreign parties who will be bound by MoUs with SLASSCOM.Potential leads brought in by member parties in the program will be matched with suitable local companies in the respective countries thus facilitating targeted networking and optimal funnelling of new business opportunities, he said.“A dedicated team at SLASSCOM will spearhead the program, making sure that networking opportunities are provided, leads are followed and overseas exposure and marketing is received,” said Uswatta."
29 March 2020, The uncertain future for China’s electric car makers,"BEIJING, March 28 - Han Zhu is on a mission to go green. The 29-year-old data analyst wants her next car to be electric. But her reasons for buying an electric vehicle are in part practical.In the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, government restrictions on the number of petrol cars sold each year mean she would have to enter a lottery or auction to be able to buy a petrol vehicle.“There is a possibility you may never get it. With the electric vehicle green licence, you don’t have to wait in line,” she says.Shenzhen has become the showpiece capital for the Chinese electric dream. In 2017 it became the first city in the world to introduce a fleet of electric buses. A year later, the government rolled out a plan to replace city taxis with electric cars.“In Shenzhen, in almost every residential building there are two charging units. One out of 10 cars on the street are Teslas,” she says. “In China if the policy leads in one direction, technology and money goes in that direction too,” she says.In less than a decade China’s new electric vehicle market has become the largest in the world. In 2018 more than a million electric vehicles were sold in China, more than three times the number sold in the US.Beijing invested an estimated $50bn (£43bn) in the industry, hoping that today’s dominance of the electric vehicle market would lead to global automobile supremacy tomorrow.And thus far the policy has been working. Over the last three years the number of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers has tripled, with more than 400 registered nationwide.But that breakneck expansion alarmed the government. Last year it decided to put the brakes on by withdrawing approximately half of its financial incentives for buyers.A slump in sales quickly followed, in the last quarter of 2019 sales for electric vehicles plummeted.Now the coronavirus has supplied a second punch. Manufacturers have been forced to halt production lines and close dealerships in a bid to stop the spread of virus.Overall auto sales in plunged 79% in February compared with the same month in 2019, according to figures from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) fell for the eighth month in a row.“China’s auto market was already reeling from a large drop in demand in 2019. In 2020 no carmaker has been immune to the effects of the coronavirus. That includes everyone from the oldest joint ventures producing internal combustion engine SUVs to the most innovative upstarts making connected electric vehicles,” says Scott Kennedy from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.“The vast majority [of electric car makers] will not survive. But how long they survive and whether industry consolidation occurs through lots of mergers or bankruptcies will depend on the willingness of the government.”After listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018 and raising billions of dollars, NIO is perhaps the highest-profile Chinese maker of electric cars.But in the five years since it was founded it has been beset by problems and has burned through hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2019 the company cut 2,000 jobs on the back of falling revenues. In February it announced it had signed a tentative agreement with a local government that has pledged to fund the company.“China is a huge market growing at an immense pace. We will adjust and adapt to the market condition,” said an NIO spokesperson.And it’s not just the car makers. China has some giant makers of components, such as batteries.In 2018 CATL, a Chinese electric battery maker, became the official supplier of BMW’s electric cars.Last month Tesla announced it would enter into an agreement with the company to supply batteries for Tesla’s newly built Shanghai mega-plant, capable of producing 500,000 vehicles a year.But despite that apparent success, analysts have their doubts.“Chinese auto and battery technology is still not world-class. CATL and BYD are strong battery makers, but they are still somewhat behind technologically from their South Korean and Japanese counterparts. And Chinese automakers are still second-class producers even in their own country and they have barely any sales outside China,” says Mr Kennedy.For car buyers, that question of quality hangs over China’s electric car makers. Yi Zhi Yong, a middle-aged entrepreneur, drives a hybrid car made by Chinese manufacturer BYD. Backed by US billionaire Warren Buffett, the company was the third-largest battery-only electric car producer in the world in 2019, according to research by EV-volumes.com. Tesla sold the most, followed by another Chinese firm, BAIC.He didn’t buy a pure electric vehicle because he is not confident about the quality.“The quality of domestic pure electric vehicles is not good at the moment,” he says. “No domestic pure electric vehicle is worth buying yet.”But he feels the progress made by China is a source of national pride. “In the 1990s we couldn’t imagine that China could build cars that can compete with the Japanese,” he says.Back in Shenzhen, Han Zhu says the rolling back of government subsidies won’t put her off buying an electric vehicle. But rather than buying a Chinese marque, she has her eye on a Tesla.“I think that they are totally different. I was super excited about Tesla but not other electric cars,” she says.- BBC"
6 September 2020,APIIT ties up with Deakin University,"Deakin University, Australia and Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology (APIIT) Sri Lanka have partnered to offer a pathway which provides students enrolling at APIIT Sri Lanka the option of transferring to Deakin University in Australia after the first year of study at APIIT to complete the Deakin University Bachelor of IT and Bachelor of Commerce degree programs.Head, School of Computing, APIIT Sri Lanka, Dr. Priyantha Kumarawadu said, “Sri Lankan students who are aiming at a world ranked university in Australia can get direct entry to the second year of the undergraduate degree program at Deakin University after completing the first year at APIIT Sri Lanka.”Those who complete the first year of study in the BSc (Hons) International Business Management degree at APIIT Sri Lanka may avail themselves of the option of completing Deakin’s Bachelor of Commerce degree in one of seven majors.Associate Dean, International, Faculty of Business and Law, Deakin University, Prof. Alexander Newman said, “Deakin’s School of Business and Law is ranked in the Top 1% of Business Schools worldwide. Through our partnership, we look forward to welcoming APIIT students into the Bachelor of Commerce and the Bachelor of Business degrees at Deakin.”Pro Vice Chancellor-International Research Partnerships, Deakin University, Prof. K Baskaran said, “Deakin University, Australia and APIIT Sri Lanka have come together to help mitigate some of the immediate challenges in a post Covid environment. APIIT will offer a pathway to Deakin programs in Computer Science, Software Engineering and Cyber Security.”"
25 April 2021,Trade deficit narrows in Jan-Feb,"The increase in exports to the pre-pandemic levels, the notable increase in workers’ remittances and the relative stability in the domestic foreign exchange market supported Sri Lanka’s external sector in February 2021.The trade deficit in February 2021 broadly remained unchanged at the level reported a year ago. In the financial account, both foreign investment in the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recorded net outflows in February 2021. The SAARCFinance swap facility of US dollars 400 million obtained from the Reserve Bank of India in July 2020 was repaid in February 2021 upon maturity. Net inflows to the domestic foreign exchange market eased the pressure on the exchange rate during the month and the regulatory measures enabled the Central Bank to absorb foreign exchange on a net basis, to build up gross official reserves. The deficit in the trade account in February 2021 amounted to US dollars 572 million and broadly remained unchanged, compared to the deficit recorded in February 2020. Both exports and imports were slightly lower in February 2021, compared to February 2020. Meanwhile, the cumulative deficit in the trade account during January - February 2021 narrowed to US dollars 1,227 million from US dollars 1,304 million recorded over the same period in 2020. "
20 January 2019,Protecting domestic footwear industry,"The footwear industry has repeatedly called for protection from foreign competition, claiming that the dumping of footwear will ruin the domestic industry.Sri Lanka is losing over US $112.5 million annually in foreign exchange as a result of cheap footwear imports from China and India.The industry estimates that the State should have gained a revenue of around Rs. 9 billion if proper taxes had been paid on the import of shoes. Local manufacturers are supposed to be on the verge of collapse as they cannot compete.The industry has made repeated calls for protection following the reduction of duties on imported sports shoes in the 2011 Budget. Successive governments since 2002 have introduced tariff barriers to protect the local footwear industry, but some duties were reduced in 2011.Shoe makers said that illegal imports are mainly factory overruns, stock lots and inferior quality products and are available in the market for less than Rs. 750 which is below the minimum total Customs tariff on footwear (Cess Rs. 500 or Rs. 600 depending on the category) plus VAT and NBT. Consumers who were befuddled as to why shoes are so expensive in Sri Lanka now know the reason.CompetitionThe industry protested when an Indian footwear manufacturer VKACY was to set up a footwear factory in Negombo. Not only are imported shoes a problem, the manufacture of shoes domestically should be restricted to locals.Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, told a Footwear and Leather Fair in 2017 that Sri Lanka’s footwear and leather exports had increased by 28 percent in 2016.“Our footwear and leather exports in 2016 increased by 28 percent compared to 2015 revenue, to $140 million showing strong growth trends,” he said.It is clear that the problem is not as straightforward as the industry claims. The local shoe industry seems to succeed competing, at least at some level in the global market. If they compete abroad, they should be able to compete in the domestic market as well and if so, why is there a need for protection?The industry maintains that letting consumers buy cheap imported shoes threatens the jobs of 40,000 people employed in the industry islandwide. The producers have demanded the reintroduction of the duty structure that prevailed before 2011.The Duty on shoes was 30 percent or Rs.1,000 per pair whichever was higher. In addition to duty, a cess of Rs. 500 was levied per pair.This is an additional cost that consumers are burdened with. Additional costs will anguish the parents of the four million children who attend school and whose shoes would need to be changed almost every year.All children need new clothes and shoes. Kitting out youngsters for school can be expensive; those who participate in sports may require several different types of shoes, putting a heavy strain on family budgets.The effect of import duties is to raise the price of both foreign products and domestic goods. These policies may ‘save’ the 40,000 jobs in the industry, but only at the expense of the overall welfare of consumers.The annual shoe requirement locally is around 40 million pairs; a greater part of the population needs to pay higher prices on shoes to support the footwear industry.The industry claims that 250,000 people are supported by the shoe industry, but policymakers must balance this against the interest of 4,000,000 households who are burdened by a higher cost of living.TemporaryTrade protection helps some producers, but it cannot do this without harming others. Who is affected by higher import duties? First, consumers who either buy an imported pair of shoes or a local shoe sold at a high price.It is not merely a case of an imported shoe being sold at a high price and consumers turning to local shoes instead. The purpose of the duty is to enable local products to be sold at higher prices benefiting manufacturers than would otherwise be possible.Since they pay higher prices, consumers would have less money to spend on other goods, indirectly hurting various other trades. Due to high prices, people will buy less; they will manage with broken or worn out shoes. Shoe traders and retailers, who sell imported shoes, will also suffer from reduced business.Various arguments are put forth to support protectionism; to protect sunrise (infant) industries, sunset (declining) industries, strategic industries (energy, water and food), save jobs or deter unfair competition.When firms within certain industries call for protection, for whatever reason, policymakers must view the issue from the perspective of the consumers as well and weigh the relative merits of the claim.Consumer interestsConsumers do not form associations and lobby for their interests, unlike businesses. Governments are under pressure to look after consumer interests. The number of consumers far outweighs the number of producers or the number of jobs concerned. The real goal of the industry is to gain security through the removal of competition.If duties are lowered, some workers in the footwear industry may lose their jobs and some or all of the firms may be forced to close due to foreign competition. The industry claims that 2,000 cottage-type businesses may have to close.Workers will have to look for employment elsewhere. However, other job opportunities will be made available since the money that consumers previously had to pay for duties could be used to buy new products or services or consume more products and services. Employment is created in other sectors because resources will flow to areas that consumers consider being as highest value to them.It is rather ironic that while the industry focuses on opening markets abroad, it is keen to keep the domestic market protected, in the interest of maximising exports and minimising ‘harmful’ imports. It is fortunate that the export destinations for Sri Lanka’s shoes are more open than Sri Lanka’s domestic market. In general, tariffs promote the production of items in which a nation is inefficient and deter other production lines in which the country has a comparative advantage.By reducing tariffs, goods that could be produced more efficiently in one country would be made there and items that could be purchased less expensively abroad would be imported.In the 1950s, Britain attempted to protect its famed Lancashire textile industry through restraints on imports. This may have prolonged its decline, but it did nothing to stop it.Low-cost textiles were produced on a mass scale by foreign competitors. Eventually, Britain’s textile industry moved to high added value luxury and designer products that sold at a premium in both domestic and foreign markets. Some UK textile products have become world-beaters, without the need for subsidies or tariffs to protect the jobs they sustain.Some shoe exporters are competing effectively in the world market. Reducing import duties on shoes would benefit consumers and spur the local industry to improve efficiency and move towards greater innovation, to the long term advantage of all concerned. "
29 November 2020,An insightful work on the future of the hard copy,"This is Not the End of the Book, is not a sentence or a phrase in a paragraph, but the title of a very special book on the future of the book or the hardcopy book in all digitalised or the Internet world. It is in fact a single conversation between two European intellectuals, Jean-Claude Carrière and Umberto Eco, and it was curated by Jean-Philippe de Tonnac, a writer and editor. This thought-provoking conversation discusses everything from how to define the first book to what is happening to knowledge now that infinite amounts of information are available at the click of a mouse.Though the resource persons of the book are intellectuals, they have separate identities. For instance, Jean-Claude Carrière is mainly a playwright and screenwriter, who once collaborated with Michael Haneke on his award-winning film The White Ribbon, and Umberto Eco is a novelist as well as a critic other than a philosopher. His first novel, The Name of the Rose, a major international bestseller, has also been translated into Sinhala as Rosa Male Nama which won the state literary prize for the best translation.The first chapter of the book, titled The book will never die, starts with the following conversation:Four phenomenaJean-Claude Carrière: “ At the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2008, one of the speakers was a futurologist who argued that four phenomena would drastically change humanity over the next fifteen years. The first was oil at 500 dollars a barrel. The second was that water, like oil, would become a commercial product, and be traded on the Stock Market. The third was the inevitability of Africa becoming an economic power – certainly something we would all like to see”.""The fourth phenomenon, according to this professional prophet, was the disappearance of the book.""The question is whether the permanent eclipse of the book – Should it in fact take place – would have the same consequences for humanity as the predicted shortage of water, or affordable oil.""Umberto Eco: “Will the book disappear as a result of the Internet? I wrote about this at the time –by which I mean at a time when the question seemed topical. Now, when I'm asked for my opinion, I simply repeat myself, rewriting the same text….""There is actually very little to say on the subject. The Internet has returned us to the alphabet. If we thought we had become a purely visual civilisation, the computer returns us to Gutenberg's galaxy; from now on, everyone has to read. In order to read, you need a medium. This medium cannot simply be a computer screen. Spend two hours reading a novel on your computer and your eyes turn into tennis balls. At home, I use a pair of Polaroid glasses to protect my eyes from the ill effects of unbroken onscreen reading. And in any case, the computer depends on electricity and cannot be read in a bath, or even lying on your side in bed.""One or two things will happen: either the book will continue to be the medium for reading, or its replacement will resemble what the book has always been, even before the invention of the printing press. Alterations to the book–as–object have modified neither its function nor its grammar for more than 500 years. The book is like the spoon, scissors, the hammer, the wheel. Once invented, it cannot be improved. You cannot make a spoon that is better than spoon."" (Pages 3–4–5)Fascinating insightsThe two intellectuals give the reading public fascinating insights into the book. There, Jean-Claude Carrièresays, ""In the religions of the Book, the book has served not only as a container or receptacle but also as a 'wide–angle lens' from which to view everything and tell everything, and perhaps decide it as well. It has been the point of arrival and of departure – giving us our image of the world, and of the end of the world too."" (Page 112)He also points out, ""A work of art isn't created a masterpiece, it becomes one. It's important to add that great books have a reciprocal effect on each other through their readers. We can of course explain the great influence that Cervantes had on Kafka. But we can also, as Gerald Genette has conclusively shown, say that Kafka has had an influence on Cervantes. If I read Kafka before reading Cervantes, then through me and without my knowing it, Kafka will impact on my reading of Quixote. Just as our journey through life, our personal experiences, the time in which we live, the knowledge we imbibe, everything, even our domestic problems and our children's misfortunes, all of it has an impact on our reading of old books."" (Page 159)In this way the book is full of new insights into the book, literature and readership so that it could be an academic as well as light reading text. In fact, itshows us how to present a scholarly subject in a simple way. Following is yet another insight by Umberto Eco into the reading:""... I have to admit that I only read War and Peace when I was forty. But I knew the basics before then. You've mentioned the Mahabharata – I've never read that, despite owning three editions in three different languages. Who's read The Thousand and One Nights from beginning to end? Who has actually read the Kama Sutra? And yet everyone talks about it, and some practice it too. So, we can see that the world is full of books that we haven't read, but that we know pretty well.….Several responsesThere are several ways of responding to the person who comes to your house, notices your impressive library and can only think to say, 'Have you read them all?'….""Personally, I've two replies. The first: 'No. These are just the books I'm planning to read next week. The ones I've already read are at the university.' The second: 'I haven't read any of these books. Why would I keep them, otherwise?' There are of course more contentious responses, if you're willing to further antagonise and even anger your guest. The truth is that we all own dozens, or hundreds, or even thousands (in the case of an extensive library) of books that we haven't read. And yet when we eventually pick them up, we find that they are already familiar. How is that? How do we already know the books that we haven't read? Firstly, there's the esoteric explanation – there are these waves that somehow travel from the book to you – to which I don't subscribe.Secondly, perhaps it's not true that you've never opened the book; over the years you're bound to have moved it from place to place, and may in the process have flicked through it and forgotten that you've done so. Thirdly, over the years you've read lots of books that have mentioned this one and so made it seem familiar. There are thus several ways to know something of books that we haven't read. (Page 270–271)This is Not the End of the Book is very important in three ways. First, it confirms that the hardcopy book will never vanish from the book market despite the challenges it faces. Second, it enlightens readers about the uniqueness of the book. Third, it presents a new form of the book which is made from one single conversation that is unfamiliar to the Sri Lankan reading public.However, as the floppy of the book cover suggests, ""Readers will close this entertaining volume feeling they have had the privilege of eavesdropping on an intimate discussion between two great minds."""
21 June 2020, Competing with competencies: Developing future-proof Sri Lankans,"Competencies are required to compete in an increasingly competitive global environment. Sri Lanka slipped from 71st place to 85th on the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) last year.This is a dismal picture, as Sri Lanka in 2012 was at 52, in 2015 at 68 and in 2016 at 71. Obviously, many fingers will be pointed at policy makers for their actions and inactions. My intention is not to engage in a detailed analysis of the reasons but to reflect on what we can possibly do together as a nation. Today’s column focuses on future competencies for Sri Lankans that will ensure confidence in competing in local, regional and global spheres, in the midst of the pandemic.OverviewThe future belongs to those who create it. In fact, we Sri Lankans are doing it on multiple fronts thanks to some enthusiastic professionals.The adequacy of political patronage for such initiatives is questionable. As it is often said, we are experiencing a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world with the pandemic. What we need to have is VUCA 2.0 with vision, understanding, confidence and agility. We see many political rumblings with multiple signals, retarding the growth focus. Our neighbouring nations such as Bangladesh are much focused on their development plans and steadfast in their growth momentum. Will they beat us on the economic front maintaining a higher growth rate to become a vibrant economy in South Asia, the way they beat us in cricket? Loads of food for thought, I believe.Future competenciesCompetencies are the measurable or observable knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviour critical to successful job performance. Choosing the right set of competencies is core for consistent performance expected by an employer. Future competencies can be easily labelled as ABCDE. Let’s see what they are.A: Analytical thinkingIrrespective of whether our background is science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) or not, the future demands us to be analytical. With the massive inflow of information, selecting, prioritising, focusing and deciding are important for speedy action. If we do not become smart in this terrain, ‘analysis paralysis’ could take place. It further invites us to work systematically and logically to resolve problems, identify cause and anticipate unexpected results. It also involves managing issues by drawing on our own experience and knowledge and on other resources as necessary.Undertaking  complex tasks and breaking them down into manageable parts in a systematic way, thinking  of multiple possible causes and anticipating consequences of situations, thinking of possible alternatives for a situation, recognising and reconciling data discrepancies, identifying  information needed to effectively solve problems, weighing the pros and cons of options and alternatives and systematically change variables to determine effects on the whole are other associated activities.At a time when there is a conscious effort to shift GCE (AL) students from arts stream to STEM areas, the emphasis on analytical skills is very relevant. Sharpness of reasoning than getting overly emotional in decision making is what is acutely needed on many social fronts.B: Business savvinessHaving a holistic understanding about the world of business is essential for any manager to perform and progress. The future demands us to move beyond our functional silos encompassing wider perspectives. Narrow specialty should pave the way for multi-skilling, perhaps retaining some specialty.If I take an HR executive as an example, does he/she know business realities such as market conditions, competitor activities, opportunities and threats out there and key people needs? I still recall, when I interviewed CEOs of South Asian countries, as a part of my doctoral research, a significant majority of them said, ”My HR person knows HR, but he/she does not know business.” Partnering with the core business processes in getting connected to business related decision making is key for a collective contribution towards corporate success. As a nation are we there? is a big question. In the public and private sectors alike, what we sadly see missing is the much needed ‘holistic thinking’. How people pursue their personal agendas with a narrow ulterior perspective with gross ignorance or glaring inconsistency is very pathetic to observe.  C: Creative mindsetCreative thinking is a mental activity, which produces new ideas or new insights. It does this by de-patterning or re-patterning thoughts. In fact, our mind is the sum total of our memories, images, desires, expectations, beliefs, feelings and other such mental processes. Thinking is, therefore, a sequence of images and events, which constitutes our mind.Creativity involves breaking patterns and thinking out of the box. A mind pattern based on traditional, or stale perceptions should give rise to a fresh wave of creative thinking. The result is the generation of new ideas.Despite the proliferation of automation, robotics and other vistas with Artificial Intelligence (AI), human creativity will be much in demand in the continuing era of imagination. Whether we can make a conscious effort to foster creativity among schoolchildren, leading to imagination and innovation is the question. D: Digital diligenceTechnology has always been an enhancer of our work. From adding machines to the advanced computer this has been the case. Such extensive applications are broadly categorised as digital transformations. When integration of digital devices to our daily lives takes place at an increasingly rapid pace, it is the survival of the fittest in being digitally diligent.In simple terms, it is about the smartness one demonstrates in embracing the change with regards to changing technology. It was  the Austrian-American economist  Joseph  Schumpeter, who first spoke  of a  “gale  of creative  destruction” to sustain economic growth. We can see a parallel to that in the now popular use of the term ‘disruption’.Prof. Clayton Christensen of  Harvard Business School, widely regarded as the  concept initiator  of disruption,  says that a disruption displaces an existing market, industry, or technology and produces something new and more efficient and worthwhile. While being disruptive on the one hand, it  is creative on the other.“We are witnessing profound shifts across all industries, marked by the emergence of new business models, the disruption of incumbents and the reshaping of production, consumption, transportation and delivery systems,” states Klaus Schwab, in his most recent book, ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’. Are we reaping the benefits of our digital initiatives? Perhaps to some extent. Creation of the Information and Communication Agency (ICTA) and now a fully-fledged ministry for digital infrastructure appear as constructive steps. Being ahead in South Asia with 4.5 G mobile communication technology is another sign to say that we have positive trends to encourage  society to be more digitally diligent. E: Emotional maturityTo harmonise the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) we need to foster Emotional Intelligence (EI). What is required is AI-EI synergy. As Daniel Goleman advocates, EI is a capacity for recognising our own feelings and those of others, for motivating ourselves, and to manage emotions well in ourselves and in our relationships. Despite many subsequent presentations and interpretations, I still prefer the five key components of EI advocated by Goleman. They are self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, empathy and effective relationships.Empathy is the key. One needs to demonstrate empathy to ensure lasting relationships and sustainable partnerships. We need to make a conscious effort to move from taking one-sided emotionally-laden erratic decisions to a more mature platform. Sri Lankans have a long way to go in this respect.ABCDE competencies vs connectionsI see a Human Resource issue at the macro level baffling national leaders. It is essential to pick the right person for  the right position, especially with regard to the  key ones from a national perspective. We see some displeasure expressed by a section of the public through social media about certain appointments. It is pertinent to mention what David Oglivy, the advertising tycoon, had to say with respect to hiring: “If each of us hires people who are smaller than we are, we shall become a company of dwarfs, but if each of us hires people who are bigger than we are, we will become a company of giants.” The hiring process has to be professionally designed and executed to hire people with potential.Challenges Leaders should be performers in practising what they preach. They must  inspire, influence and initiate in a manner to ignite result-oriented action. In contrast, laggards are passengers. They hamper  progress by being lazy and lethargic. Indecisiveness resulting in inaction is often common in their approach.Do we see more leaders or laggards? The answer lies in the results they achieve. It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness. Living with leaders and laggards leaves us with fewer choices for achievement. Leaders have to be far more effective to overcome the ineffectiveness of laggards.Way forward“You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today,” so said Abraham Lincoln. We need to embrace competencies needed for the future in the present itself. We need to train not only the current managers but also the emerging leaders in becoming future-proof.ABCDE is one clear way of awakening to the needed competencies and to take key strategic initiatives accordingly.  It reminds me what I learnt from my alma mater: ‘Disce aut Discede’ in Latin meaning ‘Learn or Depart’. I think we need to interpret it in the contemporary private and public domain as ‘Perform or Depart’."
4 July 2021,CSE keen on enhancing capital markets in Sri Lanka,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and CHEC Port City Colombo signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to enhance capital markets in Sri Lanka by taking advantage of the Colombo International Financial Centre, to set up a regionally recognised financial exchange in the country.The MoU was signed to work on a collective mission to establish an International Multi-Currency Exchange within the Port City Colombo. The exchange will serve as a gateway for both regional and global investors, while also providing an ideal platform for Sri Lankan and overseas corporates to issue foreign currency bonds and equities as well as develop other financing and risk management instruments across asset classes.CHEC Port City and the CSE will collaborate to identify and attract a global stock exchange to partner the Colombo Stock Exchange in establishing a modern world-class trading exchange, which will position Sri Lanka as a hub for capital raising in the South Asian and the ASEAN region. The CSE will also work with the regulators in providing a conducive environment for a well-functioning market while introducing state-of-the-art modern technology.Chairman, Colombo Stock Exchange, Dumith Fernando said, “The CSE is pleased to take the initiative with this first step of signing a MoU with the CHEC Port City Colombo to work towards the further development of the capital market in Sri Lanka. Through this initiative we are planning to partner an International Stock Exchange that will bring a new dimension to the Capital market and cater to the requirements of the Port City and issuers and investors regionally.”Managing Director of CHEC Port City Colombo, Jiang Houliang  said, “We strongly believe that with the right infrastructure and business friendly policies, we would succeed in positioning Port City Colombo as an attractive location for regional listings, which would be a gateway for companies around the world to access new investment opportunities.”"
8 December 2019,"In the name of sovereignty, democracy and human well-being","Sovereignty is an abstract concept while democracy or democratic rule is contingent upon the opinion of the majority, and for the benefit of all.The notion of state sovereignty contains four aspects: territory, population, authority and recognition. Human well being basically constitutes the people’s ability to meet their basic needs, such as food, housing and healthcare.Here in Sri Lanka, sovereignty seemed to be under threat during the Yahapalanaya government as some communities tried to create ethnic enclaves, thereby undermining social cohesion. Foreign funded Non-Governmental Organisations became so prominent as to dominate governance while undermining governance itself.The incident surrounding the cremation of a Buddhist monk in the Mullaitivu District amply demonstrated the extent of ethnic polarity in the country. The Yahapalanaya dispensation’s much hyped reconciliation mantra seems to have instead promoted mistrust among communities, letting religion-induced terrorism spring up on the one hand while disrupting public life in such ways as not allowing members of one community to settle in an area to which another community has laid claims based on ethnic purity, (thereby preventing even the cremation of a Buddhist monk).The economy was in tatters with economic indicators having tumbled to a record low. The economic growth rate has come down to rock bottom registering a mere 1.6 % growth rate, the previously buoyant share market ( which was in the recent past the second -best performing Stock Market in the world) became subdued and companies were forced to practice layoffs and downsizing to ensure survival.Trade slowed, as people’s spending power got thinner with little productive economic activity in the country. The agriculture sector was lagging, putting farmers into great distress (some even committed suicide), and food prices skyrocketed. When the Yahapalanaya coalition took over government, the country had a surfeit of paddy to the extent that it had to be stored even at such a vital national asset as the Mattala International Airport. With four and a half years neglect of the agriculture sector, the price of a kilo of rice had gone beyond Rs. 100.Unemployment has become widespread and even those who are employed get a mere pittance as remuneration. Education has become hollow creating walking dummies sans thinking skills, validating Nobel Prize winning British Biologist Peter Medawar’s statement, “Higher education has created a large body of people of cultivated tastes educated far beyond their capacity to undertake analytical thought.”National security evaporated, undermined by suicide bombers raiding religious places and the spectre of terrorism re-emerging. The security establishment was weakened and became a scapegoat for revenge.People’s day-to-day activities were hindered by unending waves of strikes in essential sectors, and the absence of governance.Democracy mouthing bleeding hearts decimated the country in every aspect. ‘Democracy’ diluted governance, and ‘transparency’ offered a field day for vociferous charlatans, a cabal of cronies of government bigwigs to plunder government coffers. The Constitution was emasculated through the 19th Amendment giving rise to hydra-headed power centres- the President, Prime Minister and the Speaker combining, creating anarchy in the country.The true spirit of democracy flagged in an anti-democratic milieu with elections, (which are a major denominator of democratic norms), being inordinately postponed and media institutions threatened with consequences for not toeing the Yahapalanaya’s line. Justice was warped to enact revenge on political opponents, discredit national leaders, and rein in potential future leaders.In this grim backdrop, the country was aching for a leader, not a puppet mouthing ‘democracy’. A leader who can act and usher in modernity so that sovereignty can be preserved and true democracy can be enjoyed by people in a prosperous country.Now that a visionary leader is at the helm to lead the nation, progressive forces must be on alert to stem reactionary elements that wish viciously to sabotage the plans, so that the leader can implement the programs outlined during his campaign. "

13 December 2020,Some public policies need to be sustainable - Corporate leader,"Certain aspects of public policy needs to be revisited  to make it more relevant and sustainable beyond the post-pandemic era which  calls for better access to health care services for all and low cost funding for SMEs said a top corporate leader as  the country comes close to the end  of a turbulent year and heads towards  uncertain times. He stressed the need to strike a balance between health and safety and  economic activity since sustainable productivity cannot be achieved without a healthy workforce. “There is a need to revisit certain aspects of public policy to make them more relevant  and sustainable beyond the a post-pandemic era; a pandemic which made certain social and economic inequalities more apparent, ”John Keells Holdings Chairman Krishan Balendra said, adding that this calls for focus on better access to health services for all, making low-cost funding more accessible for SMEs, and education towards developing future-ready skills It is paramount that the business community focuses on the balance between health and safety and economic activity, as without a resilient and healthy workforce there can be no sustainable economic productivity.“The corporate sector must also continually evolve, being agile with business models and employment opportunities, and be open to disruptive innovation in order to embrace opportunities posed by these unprecedented times, and be clear and transparent in communication of business performance and procedures to both internal and external stakeholders, to remain resilient. “It Is also vital for the business community to support the grassroots, which play a pivotal role in the conomic fabric, be it through value chains or by empowering the communities that we  are with,” Balendra said.On the prospects for 2021 he said with regards to key sectors for Sri Lanka,  the pandemic will have a continued impact curtailing consumer and business confidence.While the situation remains volatile and it is still not possible to determine the full impact on the economy, we are optimistic that the future looks promising, with the development of vaccines to battle the pandemic making  good progress.“With regards to the hardest hit industry, hospitality and tourism, our Group’s hotels have witnessed an encouraging momentum of forward bookings, demonstrating the ‘pent up’ demand for leisure travel when restrictions on travel ease and we have invested in upgrading some of our hotels to cater to demand in a post Covid-19 environment. “With the easing of the lockdown our businesses (except for tourism) saw a return to near normalcy.In this context we are continuing with our investments across the group. The project pipeline of the Group for 2021 and beyond includes  the mixed development ‘Cinnamon Life’. We are also continuing to  invest in the expansion of the supermarket business.”He said 2020 forced businesses to think and act differently to remain competitive and relevant; be it how we manage leaner production lines, explore alternatives to traditional distribution channels or productively engage with a remote workforce.The new normal this year, created trends in consumer behaviour which paved the way for more digital solutions and entrepreneurship, all of which cushioned certain impacts on business and created benefits which we are likely to see continuing into the future.There was also learning in terms of businesses to be more agile with business models and have robust contingency and business continuity plans.‘In Sri Lanka, while the Government provided some financial and economic support to stimulate economic activity and support business workers - such as debt moratoriums, concessionary loans, extension of repayment and bill payment deadlines and welfare programs to soften the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, a more focused strategy may have been needed to provide a stimulus much larger in scale similar to the massive economic support packages announced by other countries."

16 February 2020,Leaders’ ego kill business,"While one might think a big ego is actually a common trait among over-achieving business people (or over-achievers in general), the truth is that an out-of-control ego is anything but conducive to success. Egos kill businesses.Although a great mix of ignorance and ego is needed to start a successful business, eventually egos will kill it. We start companies based on our technical skills or business acumen, but over time it’s our emotional intelligence that allows the business to grow and scale with tremendous upside.What’s your experience with Sri Lankan business leaders – don’t most of them have egos? Some who come across as being leaders with the best of human attributes in public do behave completely differently within the workplace.This may be true for your leader too. Does it help you or your organisation? Does it help the leader in the long run? These are the critical questions.Ego is an important and necessary ingredient to become a successful entrepreneur.I have worked with over 60 entrepreneurial leadership teams, the leader of each business had a healthy dose of ego and that’s not a bad thing.The issue is that over time, egos destroy businesses. Leaders who don’t get honest feedback to drive the business forward, get disconnected from the front-line employees, they don’t let go of the vine, and they become ignorant to their impact on every employee within the organisation, they become blind at the top.Learn from the fightersHumility goes hand-in-hand with an egoless leader. A big ego makes you afraid to push, to try new things, to open up and grow. Ego makes you complacent and stagnant in your thinking.The epic fighters have an inner fierceness, a focus that belies their calm appearance and a no-excuses drive to do whatever it takes to succeed. A sincere attitude, laser-focused drive and a stoic commitment to a work ethic drives results. When the ego is at the forefront, arrogance can kill opportunities.The loud egocentric leader who doesn’t permit dialogue, judges people who share their experiences and lacks emotional intelligence, kills dreams quickly.Close-minded people are less likely to discover new ideas, as they disengage from learning from others or forming connections. False assumptions are made, team work is devalued and humility gets thrown out of the window. When egos are left behind, an environment of collaboration will become the platform of your culture. The leader sets the tone and when it turns into a culture, the belief is infused throughout the organisation. When you come in with an open mind and focus on mission success, you will foster a culture of collaboration. This will permeate the tapestry of the organisation.Success is based on relationships and bringing people graciously along, not on personal advancement.Recognise that it takes a committed team effort to work towards viable solutions.It starts with youLeaving ego behind has different meanings to different people. It takes a humble leader to admit what they do not know to lead the organisation’s most precious treasure – our daughters, sons, mothers and fathers. Egos bent on personal glory are not what we need in the 21st century.People deserve putting the team first and egos last. To break through the turf wars in your organisation, starts with you.Working on yourself is the highest act of leadership. Alone, you can make good decisions. Collaboratively, you envision greater opportunities.Checking your ego means abandoning pursuit of approval, attention, and appreciation and then channeling your energy to awakening and leading with the ultimate version of you.Business lives or dies on the decisions you make and the attitudes you hold from the beginning. All mindsets feed the ego.Business is a wild ride, with lots of ups and downs and unexpected turns. The best workplaces represent a commitment by every person to become their best self.Starting with the founder, the alignment of personal and organisational values creates the compass for all decision making. When you move your ego to the side and place your best self forward, you create a value-based focus in the workplace."

He has published in highly regarded journals like Annals of Operations Research; Journal of Business Research; International Journal of Information Management; Management Decision; Information Systems and e-Business Management; Benchmarking, and so on.Prof. Behl’s session, “Generating research question from problematisation”was launched under the patronage of Dean, Faculty of Management Studies, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka Prof. Athula Gnanapala and organizers of the webinar series, Senior Lecturer, Sabaragamuwa University/Brand Ambassador Emerald Publishing – South Asia Dr. Jayantha N. Dewasiri, Publishing Relationship Manager, Emerald Publishing Miss. Sangeeta Menon, College of Healthcare Management and Economics Gulf Medical University Prof. Sudhir Rana, GIFT University, Pakistan Prof. Kashif Saeed and Regional Marketing Manager, Emerald Publishing Miss. Disha Lakhanpal.The session began with a welcome address by Senior Lecturer, Faculty of Management Studies, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka Dr. R.S.S.W. Arachchi.Dr. Behl’s started the session with “The Power of Questioning: What? Why? How?” emphasising that it is important to ask the right questions rather than seeking for answers for every question. He then spoke about how theory building is at the heart of researchers.There are various myths for development of theory. Often people choose and select wrong theories because of unawareness of the right theory. Other reasons of selection of theory is because of its popularity.Theory should not be selected based on its popularity rather than appropriateness. Using popularity as a tool to shortlist theory is a common mistake made by the researchers. The next myth is that researchers feel that they have read the entire literature or done enough literature theory before writing their research papers. In reality, he added, it is not and never possible. Then comes the issue of over reliance on published literature. Instead, the authors should refer to ‘experience’ and ‘observation’ as two more dimensions to reach to the research gaps. Thus, evidence-based research forms the essence of every research.He further said that choice of theory comes with choice of assumptions. Unlike scientific theories, management theories need to have more assumptions that are often missed out by researchers while using these theories or making a selection in their research. The question ‘what to choose?’ and ‘how to choose?’, when it comes to understand theory, remains the most important aspect in doing theory focused research.Dr. Behl explained that the most commonly used jargons by researchers when it comes to performing literature review and finding gaps are ‘Extend this literature’, ‘Address this gap in the literature’, ‘Call for empirical research’ and so on. Although these phrases are acceptable, they do not depict quality in the work of the researcher. High-quality impactful research should reflect the choices made by researchers in terms of their selection of theory and more importantly their assumptions behind it.More often the researchers face the problem of under problematisation (Such ‘gap-spotting’ means that the assumptions underlying existing literature for the most part remain unchallenged in the formulation of research questions) or over problematisation (aim of these orientations is to disrupt rather than build upon and establish existing body of knowledge)Talking about the critical piece in debate - Gap Spotting v/s Gap Filling, Dr. Behl mentioned that most studies do not explicitly discuss the importance and innovation in research gap spotting. While others are too much involved in gap spotting as a phenomenon that they miss out on discussing and exploring the right research question.Further into the session, he discussed the three prominent ways that gap spotting can be done - confusion spotting, neglect spotting and application spotting. The research task, he added, is to provide an alternative perspective to further our understanding of the particular subject matter in question. While many of the studies reviewed emphasise one major way of constructing research questions, combinations of different gap-spotting ways are not uncommon.What makes ‘Gap Spotting’ the obvious choice of researchers? It is safe, uncontroversial and safe. Research Institutions encourage gap-spotting. Contemporary journal formats encourage gap-spotting. It often makes sense to adopt gap-spotting. The alternative to gap-spotting – problematisation - is difficult.Problematisation is first and foremost an “endeavour to know how and to what extent it might be possible to think differently, instead of what is already known”. Asking the right question involves - What types of assumptions are relevant to consider? How can these assumptions be identified, articulated and challenged in a way that is likely to lead to the development of an interesting theory?At the end of the session, Dr. Behl discussed solutions and the way forward. He listed them as identifying a domain of literature for assumption challenging investigation, identifying and articulating assumptions underlying the chosen domain of literature, evaluating articulated assumptions, developing an alternative assumption ground and considering assumptions in relation to the audience.For the Q & A session towards the end of the presentation, Dr. Behl was joined by program co-ordinators, Prof. Sudhir Rana, College of Healthcare Management and Economics, Gulf Medical University and Editor, South Asian Journal of Marketing (Emerald Publishing) and Miss Sangeeta Menon, Publishing Relationship Manager, Emerald - India.

10 January 2021,Asia Securities Research forecasts strong growth for equities,"* Equities will remain the preferred asset class in 2021 amid a low interest rate environment* Corporate earnings and free cashflow to see healthy growth in 2021 fueled by sustained tax cuts, low finance costs and better demand conditionsFollowing a year of volatility, stockbroking firm Asia Securities (Pvt) Ltd, stated in a report, that the road ahead for Sri Lanka’s capital markets is optimistic, with the ASPI expected to reach 7,400-7,600 in 2021.The Sri Lankan stock market marked a V-shaped recovery in 2020, seeing one of its strongest rallies to recover all losses suffered over the course of the coronavirus pandemic. The latest Asia Securities Sri Lanka: 2021 Equity Outlook report titled ‘Zero in on the Recovery’ highlights that the forces behind one of the fastest recoveries include a low interest rate environment, manufacturing-dominance led by protection for local firms, and renewed economic hopes and policy stability with the Presidential and Parliamentary elections now behind.Strong bounce backThe report highlights that “Low interest rates locally continue to provide further impetus for the market to rally and local investors will continue to carry the mantle this year. Despite the likelihood of rates bottoming out once credit growth picks up, we expect equities to remain the more attractive asset class as rates will be recovering from a historic low.”Further upside to ASPI amid low interest ratesThe strong trajectory for Sri Lanka equities is supported by an improvement in earnings (coming from a lower base), and large caps gaining momentum with earnings picking up. The Asia Securities report also forecasts a healthy pickup in corporate earnings in 2021 driven by consumption-related stimuli, and lower finance costs which will help the bottom line.Emerging markets ready for primetime in 2021, however, Sri Lanka to see latent fund flowsAsia Securities Research said that the momentum in equities from this point forth will also be dependent on how certain global factors playout. Emerging markets are expected to take off again in 2021, breaking a decade-long trend of asset allocations towards developed markets amidst superior growth, a strengthening USD, and strong yields. Several factors will drive this shift, including:* Weaker USD in the medium-term – A weakening USD will push investors to rebalance their portfolios and spur capital flows into emerging markets. With lower currency risk, Asia Securities Research sees cheaper emerging market valuations being more appealing and rewarding for investors.Emerging markets set for takeoff* Faster growth than developed markets – Bloomberg consensus point at emerging markets growing (real GDP) at a faster 5.0% in 2021E, compared to 4.0% for developed markets. (2022E; emerging markets – 5.1%, developed markets – 3.1%). One of the main reasons for a faster emerging markets recovery is better management of the pandemic. With stronger growth prospects and low currency risks, Asia Securities Research notes that emerging markets are in a “sweet spot” in 2021.* Lower valuations – While emerging markets have underperformed the S&P 500 over the last decade, earnings expectations have been on the rise with hopes of a faster recovery.* Low interest rates – As it is still a struggle to find yield in government bonds amidst low interest rates, a risk-on approach with global recovery will drive funds to faster growing emerging market economies.* Trade – The election of Joe Biden represents a return to more predictable US politics. An easing of trade tensions between US and China can further aid recovery in the Asian Markets.While a risk-on sentiment with vaccine deployment and global recovery will favour equities in 2021, Asia Securities Research highlighted that regional countries are likely to attract foreign fund flows first, with Sri Lanka seeing latent fund flows. Concerns around Sri Lanka’s low credit rating mean that Sri Lankan equities can expect a very gradual improvement in foreign fund flows.“Covid recovery” beneficiary stocksAsia Securities’ key picks for 2021 are weighted towards the consumer sector, and cyclical stocks that look attractive in a path to recovery. Corporate earnings will see a healthy pickup in 2021 driven by consumption-related stimuli, and lower finance costs which help the bottom line. In addition, free cash flow generation should remain strong, given that corporates will operate in an environment fueled by tax cuts early in late 2019/early 2020. Local manufacturing is also expected to see improved utilisation with higher protection. With an accommodative fiscal policy and consistent tax policies, the effects of the tax cuts (yet to materialise given the timing and impact of Covid-19) are also expected to come to fruition this year. "
27 September 2020,KPI scorecard helps boost sales team performance,"The Key Performance Indicator or KPI is a measurable value that demonstrates the effectiveness of the achievement of organisational business objectives.Companies use KPIs to evaluate the success of attaining business targets. Occasionally said to be an overused term, KPIs can play one of the most important roles in the growth of a business entity. While KPIs act as a guidepost in business, the measurements can be an actionable scoreboard that keeps business strategy on track. Every company should have this important set of guidelines to reach the desired targets.One of the most important aspects of KPIs is that it is a form of communication and conforms to the same rules and practices as any other form of exchange. Through KPIs, precise and relevant information is absorbed and acted upon. In developing a strategy to formulate KPIs, the company must understand the basic objectives to plan how to achieve and who will act upon the information. The formulating team should know which processes are required to be measured with the KPI dashboard.Key performance indicators in sales are created to achieve the outcome, efficiency and effectiveness of the exact selling activity against a predetermined target. The KPIs in sales are decided on the specific needs of an organisation, considering various factors.Therefore, the measurements are subjective and vary from business to business. KPIs for sales must be aligned with the results the company aims to achieve. Focus on the wrong measurements will deceive and misguide the sales team.Let us analyse the possible advantages of setting up performance indicators. Salespeople are given targets to be achieved in a specific period and they know that their achievement can be visible after that period. It is a simple process.The main advantage of the pre-defined indicators is that it assists the sales team in a more organised manner.Instead of simply groping in the dark for sales, assessment of structured information on sales targets and achievements can be a tremendous support for the sales team, in addition to the motivation the indicators provide to them.Equal treatmentKPIs also provide equal treatment to everybody in the organisation. The information derived by the program is directly communicated to the top management without the influence of others where they can evaluate each employee individually. Properly defined objectives that are divided and broken down to time-bound short and long term sales revenue targets help organisations to perform above average. The objective of a sales team is to improve the revenue of the company, defeat competition, and increase market visibility to the maximum. To reach these objectives, the senior management must understand the data, guidelines, and metrics set up through KPIs. With the tracking and monitoring of the KPIs, the sales team can be empowered more and encourage them to do better. Therefore, let us run through some of the main performance indicators used by the sales teams to find better prospects, close more deals, and boost up revenue. Conversational intelligence is an important factor to consider in sales KPIs. The strategists must look beyond the mere numbers when considering a possible customer.An emotional link and a bond are required today to convert decision-makers who are well aware of the market conditions with the availability of technology.Engaging prospects by sharing related personal opinions can build up trust in the said prospective customer. Acting as a trusted advisor can be a valuable asset to a salesperson in the eyes of a buyer. Tracking the effectiveness of the conversation the salesperson persists with a customer must be included as a KPI to evaluate the quality of such communications where action steps can be identified.The average amount of time taken from the initial contact with the customer until the closure of the sale (known as sales cycle length) is another important measurement a company must constantly monitor.Depending on the type of product or service on offer, this information can immensely help to develop the productivity of the sales team.Usually, good salespeople do not rush prospects for the buying decision although the cycle should be reasonably timed. Measuring and keeping a close track of the length of the sales cycle can immensely help the sales forecasting, based on the available leads in the pipeline.Work in harmonyThe sales conversion rate metrics measure the effectiveness of a sales team. The information is vitally important as the knowledge of the percentage of the number of conversions gives an insight into aimed success. The sole intention of a marketing organisation is to convert the maximum possible number of prospects into buyers.To convert prospects to customers, the entire organisation, specifically sales and marketing should work in harmony. Therefore, implementing a sales conversion rate as a KPI is an effective way to integrate all relevant divisions of the company to increase sales.Monitoring customer retention rates or tracking the number of recurring customers is another vital area key performance indicators should be compulsorily introduced.Measuring the retention rate in a specified period of time is enormously helpful to a sales team to ascertain that they are on the correct path in the sales strategy of the organisation. Information on the number of customers at the start of such a specified period, the number of customers at the end of the period, and the number of new customers during the period are identified and compiled through this process.The Customer Lifetime Value, known as CLV is an analysed prediction of the total revenue projected from a customer throughout the relationship. The CLV inspires the salesperson to establish and develop mutual customer relationships that can help an organisation in many ways.Information flowCLV is useful for sales managers to understand the types of buyer characteristics better. These metrics represent the upper limit of expenditure to gain new customers.Hence, customer retention must be included in KPIs. Building a powerful sales funnel is one of the most important purposes of a commercial organisation. It is an absolute necessity to know the activities of the company’s sales team and monitor how many leads they bring in.Sales performance indicators not only inform the management of how active the sales team is but it also can point to possible problems early. Good information flow is critical for an organisation.The key performance indicators measure against a benchmark to provide actionable information that leads to an organisation to advance more effectively. KPIs breakdown complex data into understandable metrics, making the entire organisation aligned toward a common goal. As KPIs are invariably linked to incentives, teams and individuals are tremendously encouraged to achieve goals.These incentives are offered to improve KPIs to the specified level and the time. The information provided by KPIs empowers employees to increase their performances.Therefore, setting up Key performance indicators should be a compulsory requirement of any organisation, irrespective of whether the company is small, medium, or large."
15 March 2020,SEC to support Stock Market,"The Members of the Commission of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) met last week to assess the current situation in the stock market and determine what regulatory relief and assistance was needed to manage the impact arising from the global stock market downturn due to the panic triggered by the escalation of the Covid-19 outbreak.

24 January 2021,Jack Ma makes first appearance since October,"HONG KONG, Jan. 22 - Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma has made his first appearance since Chinese regulators cracked down on his business empire.His absence had fuelled speculation over his whereabouts amid increasing official scrutiny of his businesses.The billionaire met 100 rural teachers in China via a video meeting on Wednesday, according to local government media.Alibaba shares surged 5% on Hong Kong’s stock exchange on the news.Tianmu News, which is backed by the provincial Zhejiang government, first reported that Mr Ma addressed the teachers as part of one of his charity foundation’s initiatives.The annual event is usually hosted in the resort city of Sanya, but was held online this year because of Covid-19 restrictions.“We cannot meet in Sanya due to the epidemic,” he said in the speech.“When the epidemic is over, we must find time to make up for everyone’s trip to Sanya, and then we will meet again!”In the video, he was dressed in a blue pullover and spoke directly to the camera from a room with grey marble walls and a striped carpet.It was not clear from the video or the Tianmu News article where he was speaking from.Last month, China’s central bank hauled in executives from Ant Group and ordered a major shake-up of the company’s operations.Mr Ma is a founder and key shareholder of Ant Group, which is China’s biggest payments provider.Before ordering the shakeup of the company, regulators had already scuppered Ant Group’s listing on the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges.The USD 37bn share market offering was expected to be the biggest of 2020. Separately, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation announced an investigation into Alibaba over monopolistic practices.Suspicions about Mr Ma’s whereabouts were raised earlier this month, when he missed the recording of Africa’s Business Heroes, a television show on which he was a judge.Although Alibaba attributed his absence to a scheduling conflict, several media reports said he had not been seen since making comments that were seen as critical of China’s banking system at a public event in Shanghai in October.– BBC"
31 May 2020,TFC employees to take up matter in court,"The employees of The Finance Company PLC (TFC), one of the oldest finance companies in the country will seek justice from court for the loss of employment due to the termination of the company’s licence, said a spokesman for the TFC employees union on Friday.“We have been unjustly treated by the decision to terminate the licence of the company which the authorities failed to revive for over a decade. We are totally displeased with the drastic move which has led to the loss of several jobs at a critical time when the economy has been hit by a major crisis,” he said.There was ample time for the regulator to put the house back on track and in order instead of winding down its operations which sets a bad precedence of the gross inability to resuscitate an institution which needed an investor to infuse fresh capital to continue operations, a union official said.According to reports  the gap in the balance sheet widened to Rs. 20 billion around last year from a Rs. 1.4 billion net asset base in 2009 when the institution was brought under the purview of the Central.The employees’ union of the now defunct TFC had a paw wow with the authorities early this year where they were assured steps would be taken to revive the company and that it would not be shut down.The Finance Company PLC (TFC) carried its business activities under the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011 (FBA) and was severely impacted by the failure of a number of financial institutions within the Ceylinco Group in 2008.Since then, the financial status of the company deteriorated gradually, leading to a severe liquidity crisis.A media release by the Central Bank last weekend stated: “All efforts made to revive the company through different strategies have failed and the continuity of current status will be further detrimental to the interest of the depositors and other stakeholders of the company. Further, the depositors of TFC were unable to withdraw their money over the past fifteen months.“As previously informed by the press release dated 23rd October 2019, The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (MB) issued a Notice of Cancellation (NOC) of the finance business licence issued to TFC, in terms of the powers vested under the FBA, with effect from October 23, 2019, in order to safeguard the interests of the depositors and other stakeholders of TFC.“TFC had failed to tender a valid objection to the MB against such NOC within the stipulated time in terms of the provisions available in FBA. “Accordingly, the licence of TFC can be cancelled after December 21, 2019 onwards in terms of the FBA. However, upon the request of the company, the MB allowed TFC to call for a fresh round of Expression of Interests to Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions 22nd May 2020 identify a credible investor with valid proof funds and a viable business restructuring plan to revive the operations of the company but TFC failed to identify such investor up to date.“Therefore, the MB decided to cancel the finance business licence issued to TFC, in terms of the FBA with effect from May 22, 2020. TFC is not permitted to engage in finance business under the FBA with effect from such date.The Director of the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions of the Central Bank has decided to cancel the Certificate of Registration of TFC as a Registered Finance Leasing Establishment under the provisions of the Finance Leasing Act No. 56 of 2000.”The Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme of the CBSL will take steps to pay compensation to the insured depositors under the applicable laws and regulations which would facilitate to settle 93% of the company’s total depositors in full (135,100 depositors out of 145,172 total depositors), while each of the remaining 7% depositors (10,072 depositors) will also receive Rs.600,000 as a part of their deposit amount and the remaining balance may be recovered in the process of liquidation subject to the priority of claims. - LF"
2 February 2020,UN backs Lanka’s industry diagnostic initiative,"A high level team from the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), Vienna and the UN Resident Coordinator Sri Lanka, launched the next phase of Sri Lanka industry revolution in Colombo recently.“Sri Lanka’s industry sector contributes 27 percent to its GDP. The Government’s objective is to move the economy from an economy intensively based on resources to an economy based on knowledge-based industries - moving Sri Lanka from ‘Industry 2.0’ and 3.0 to ‘Industry 4.0’,” said Vienna based Chief of Regional Division of Asia Pacific UNIDO International Centre, Ralf Bredel.Bredel was addressing the launch of the new UNIDO Sri Lanka Country Program 2020-2024 (UNIDOSLCP) themed ‘Towards Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialisation in Sri Lanka’ at the Kingsbury Hotel.United Nations Resident Coordinator Sri Lanka Ms Hanaa Singer, Sri Lanka UNIDO Focal Point National Director Nawaz Rajabdeen, UNIDO Representative, Regional Office-India Rene Van Berkel, Senior Research and Industrial Policy Officer-UNIDO Vienna International Centre, Dr Anders Isaksson, Secretary to Ministry of Industry and Supply Chain Management J R Ranjith, and 30 representatives from the business sector, UN and EU agencies, government institutions, chambers and industry representatives were also present.Bradel said, “The objective of UNIDO’s new country program is to see how we can support these endeavours. The ambition is to go beyond just the number of isolated standalone projects to follow a programmatic approach which is also able to make an impact in industrial policy level.“The ambition is to manage expectations very carefully, and Sri Lanka government wants to make sure that there’s clear ownership on all sides. So we’ve had a number of bilateral discussions with many of the government departments and also with development partners.“UNIDO is not a funding agency but a technical agency. We have to be realistic in terms of what we can produce at this point-we are very willing to explore how we can facilitate interaction. The 2019 Abu Dhabi Declaration moved to develop global manufacturing alliance through business sector engagement. The business sector is very important - through Sri Lanka’s Industrial Development Board we were trying to reach out to the business sector,” he said.UN Resident Coordinator Sri Lanka, Ms Hanaa Singer said, “The United Nations Secretary-General launched the Decade of Action, which is a call for everyone to take action to deliver the 2030 sustainable development agenda. We only have 10 years left to achieve these goals.“There is a urgent need to step up action. There is a need to focus on drivers for sustainable development, including industry, infrastructure and innovations as captured in MDG 9,” she said.UNIDO expects to finalise all local industry consultations by May and to introduce the finalised Country Program (CP) immediately thereafter. The UNIDOSLCP formulation work is a collaborative process and will involve Sri Lankan industries in many stages of the process.UN’s Goal 9 SDG (infrastructure, industrialisation and innovation) is a driver of productivity, inclusive economic growth and job creation and is the sole SDG that directly involves industries of the world. "

31 May 2020, Pandemic changes insurance landscape,"The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the insurance landscape and its modus operandi in Sri Lanka and there will be a surge in demand for insurance to protect individuals and their enterprises from similar pandemics in the future, insurance industry experts said.Senaratne Insurance (Pvt) Ltd., Deputy Chairman and Insurance Consultant, Ainsely Alles said the areas of insurance that would trigger demand are loss of profits in operations and losses caused by  event cancellations, delays at construction sites, medical, life and workmen’s compensation.“Local insurers will have to respond positively to this increased demand with conducive coverage wordings to ensure peace of mind for the public.It will be a challenge to the local insurers as it is rumoured that the reinsurers are moving ahead with caution, due to the short term losses faced by them due to Covid-19, to exclude and/or limit the coverage for such pandemics in the future,” Alles said.However, he said that such scenarios would be short term and that insurers will bounce back and provide the requisite insurance cover as insurers have been always receptive to customer demands.“The Covid-19 posed a major challenge to the  insurance industry in Sri Lanka. However, the industry is resilient as it was when the tsunami struck and terrorism that plagued the country for a long period,” Alles said.On the loss figures for the local industry, he said the actual numbers are not out as yet, although clients have lodged their claims with the insurance companies.“Most of the losses emanate from business interruption insurance policies. Insurers do not envisage that claims would be lodged on other types of policies as a direct consequence of the pandemic,” he said, adding that in respect of business interruption policies too, the claims are for loss of gross profit caused by reduction in turnover during the curfew period.Insurers are reviewing the ‘Infectious Disease’ extension provided under the business interruption insurance to check whether the claims fall within the scope of the clause.He said in a pandemic situation, it would be medical insurance that would face the brunt of the claims but in this instance, as the Government ensured that the patients were taken care of by them rather than leaving it to the private health operators, there were no medical claims under Covid-19.Internationally, it has been reported that Lloyd’s of London estimates the Covid-19 losses to be around $ 203 billion which includes claims, underwriting and claim expenses and investment losses.Insurance and reinsurance giants such as AIG have estimated the losses to be in the region of $ 272 million, while Munich Re 800 million Euros, Swiss Re $ 280 million and Zurich Re $ 280 million.Most of the losses are from property, engineering, business interruption and event cancellation, which include postponement of the Olympic Games.“The outbreak of the pandemic has encouraged people to learn new IT skills in a virtual office concept. Insurers can view this positively and digitalise most of their operations to ensure internal efficiency and external effectiveness through customer centric enablers. Insurers face high internal cost and business acquisition costs, hence, digitalisation of end-to-end processes would positively impact cost structures, ultimately benefiting customers with reduced premiums,” Alles said.However, he said that although technology was extensively used for internal efficiencies, it was not fully checked for robustness in a ‘work from home’ or virtual office scenario. Most of the insurers had business continuity plans in place but the pandemic tested its effectiveness. Yet, he said one must note that insurers ensured that the policies were issued, renewals confirmed, provided platforms to remit premiums, concessions to pay the premiums without lapsing, claims inspected and settled with the least possible delay. Insurance Association of Sri Lanka President Gehan Rajapakse said the current circumstances could be analysed in different ways. First, the ‘lockdown’ imposed due to the pandemic has obviously disrupted business activities and the usual negative impact on revenue, cash flows and profitability is being felt by the industry.From an operational perspective the industry responded swiftly to put in place remote working arrangements and continued to serve customers effectively. In the medium term, with weak economic growth expected, disposal income will be limited and hence pose a negative impact on the purchase of insurance products that are not compulsory.This will be particularly applicable in the retail space. However, we do not expect to see any reduction in demand for insurance by corporates which will continue to transfer their risks to insurance companies as they did in the past.Yes, the pandemic has in fact brought to the surface the importance of retail insurance products such as life and health products. As lifestyles change with increased disposable income these products will continue to have demand. On the role played by the industry to support crisis hit clients and businesses, he said the industry with the regulator put together a program in which policyholders have been given extended grace periods of up to 90 days to settle due premiums without  the policy lapsing.During this period all the benefits of the policy are assured.“As an industry we are concerned with retaining customers for the longer term and apart from the above I am sure companies will adopt their own strategies to retain customers who may have been affected,” he said. Rajapakse said the industry is geared to face fresh challenges in the future and added that the industry functions within the framework of a highly regulated framework with high levels of compliance to regulations and guidelines.The industry has an excellent relationship with the regulator and together the industry has chartered a course of maintaining high standards of compliance. Apart from the commitment to regulatory compliance, the industry is managed by experienced, professional boards and management teams that do understand the responsibility they carry in managing insurance companies“The government through the NITF is a partner to the industry of ensuring the security of the industry and we believe it will continue to do so by taking action to diversify risks,” Rajapakse said."
18 November 2018,EDB initiative to boost exports to Japan,"The Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Embassy in Japan is organising a visit by an Inward Buyer Delegation from Japan, from December 3 to 5 with the objective of developing business links between Sri Lankan companies and Japanese buyers, and increase awareness among Sri Lankan exporters, regarding the Japanese market.Japan is the 13th largest export destination for Sri Lanka. The total export value from Sri Lanka to Japan was US $ 207.0 million in 2017 and total imports from Japan to Sri Lanka for the same period was US $ 1,038.5 million.In 2017, Sri Lanka’s major exports to Japan were apparel, tea, fisheries products, coir textile fiber products, insulated cables and table and kitchenware.

2 February 2020,CB to keep a close eye on 20 financial institutions,"The Central Bank (CB) is closely monitoring around 20 of the 42 licensed financial institutions, under its supervision, facing capital adequacy issues, a pre-requisite to sustain operations, said a senior Central Banker at the media briefing on the first Monetary Policy Review for the year at the Central Bank last week.He said the Central Bank has been monitoring these institutions for some time and had issued notices to address issues urgently.The capital regulations on licensed finance companies under BASEL rules on banks require finance companies to increase their capital ratios from 2018 through 2021. The tier 1 and tier 11 ratios of licensed finance companies needs to be increased to 8.5 percent and 12.5 percent from the five percent and 10 percent ratios.Capital adequacy regulations help improve the resilience of the financial sector to counter economic shocks. However, it could also contribute to capitalisation pressures particularly for the small-scale financial entities.With regard to the pioneering financial entity - The Finance Company PLC (TFC), the Central Bank has proposed the winding down of operations due to its deteriorated financial status.“We had issued the notice of cancellation of licence to TFC with the due process followed and now it is up to the Finance Ministry to decide,” Central Bank Deputy Governor H.A. Karunaratne said.On renegotiating with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Senior Deputy Governor said an IMF delegation is currently in the country assessing the policy framework of the government.The government after coming into power expressed interest in resuming negotiations with the multi-national donor. The former government sought US$ 1.5 billion from the IMF under an Extended Fund Facility in mid 2016 which is scheduled to end in mid 2020.Central Bank officials declined to comment on the Forensic Audit report on the bond scam as it is now being taken up in Parliament.The Central Bank cut key interest rates on the Standing Deposit Facility Rate and the Standing Lending Facility Rate by 50 basic points to 6.50 per cent and 7.50 per cent.The Board arrived at this decision following an analysis of current and expected developments in the domestic economy and the financial market as well as the global economy.The Bank in its communique noted that the decision supports a continued reduction in market lending rates, thereby facilitating the envisaged recovery in economic activity given the favourable medium term outlook for inflation, which is well anchored within the 4-6 per cent range.Global monetary policy continued to remain accommodative amidst concerns over low economic growth downward revisions to global growth projections were announced in the January 2020 update of the World Economic Outlook of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), owing to weaker than expected growth across emerging market economies, especially India.The global economy is estimated to have grown by 2.9 per cent in 2019. Meanwhile, global growth prospects have been further threatened by the spread of the coronavirus that originated in China.In the light of subdued global growth and softening inflationary pressures, central banks of advanced economies continued to maintain an accommodating policy stance, while a number of emerging market economy central banks eased monetary policy further thus far in 2020.A recovery in domestic economic growth is expected. As suggested by available indicators and latest estimates, domestic economic activity has remained subdued in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily with subpar growth in agriculture and industry related activities.However, in 2020, a revival in economic activity is envisaged supported by appropriate fiscal and monetary measures, improved business confidence and political stability.The Central Bank anticipates an economic growth of around four percent this year following a below par performance last year recording 2.7 percent in the third quarter and the year end growth to be below three percent.Inflation is expected to remain in mid single digit levels in the medium term headline inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change in Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI), accelerated in December 2019 owing to domestic supply disruptions.In spite of such short term fluctuations, the near term forecast suggests that inflation will hover below five per cent in 2020, and stabilise between 4-6 per cent thereafter, assisted by appropriate policy measures and underpinned by well anchored inflation expectations.External sector remains resilient amidst growing macroeconomic headwinds. Trade performance during the first eleven months of 2019 improved over the previous year with a notable contraction in imports and a marginal improvement in merchandise exports, resulting in a significant decline in the trade deficit.A faster than anticipated recovery in the tourism sector helped mitigate the impact of Easter Sunday attacks to a larger extent, although arrivals and earnings remained low compared to 2018. Workers’ remittances moderated somewhat in 2019 reflecting the trend observed in recent years.Meanwhile, renewed foreign interest on the rupee denominated Government securities market resulted in a net inflow during the year thus far, although the Colombo Stock Exchange witnessed a marginal net outflow of foreign investment from the secondary market during this period.The Sri Lankan rupee, which appreciated by 0.6 per cent against the US dollar in 2019, remained broadly unchanged so far during 2020. Gross official reserves are estimated at US dollars 7.6 billion at end 2019, providing an import cover of 4.6 months.The pickup in money and credit growth observed in December 2019 is expected to continue in 2020. Supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance, growth of credit extended to the private sector picked up in December 2019, on a year-on-year basis, following a continued slowdown. Headline Inflation (CCPI based) Projection: Inflation, which is projected to hover below 5 per cent in 2020, is expected to gradually stabilise in mid single digit levels thereafter. - LF"
24 May 2020,Leading economist warns 10 years of depression and debt,"LINDON, May 23. (BBC) - Economist Nouriel Roubini has warned of a prolonged downturn and sluggish recovery from the coronavirus.Nicknamed Dr. Doom for his gloomy predictions, Professor Roubini said there are some jobs that simply will not come back after this crisis.Even if the global economy recovers this year from the impact of the coronavirus, it will be ""anaemic"".He warned of ""unprecedented"" recession. Professor Roubini foresaw the financial crisis in 2008 before many others.""During the global financial crisis it took about three years until output fell sharply,"" he told the BBC's Talking Asia programme from his home in New York.""This time around it didn't take three years, not even three months. In three weeks there was a freefall of every component.""DrasticProfessor Roubini also said any recovery will be in the shape of what economists call a ""U"", or even ""something closer to an L"" - what he calls a ""Greater Depression.A U-shaped recovery means that growth will fall and bottom out, and then pick up only after a prolonged period of slow or no growth.An L shaped recovery is even more drastic - falling sharply and staying there for an extended period of time.That's because of how many jobs have been lost in both rich and poor countries as a result of massive lockdowns to combat the virus.""These jobs that are gone are going to come back only in part, with lower wages, no benefits, part-time,"" he said.""There will be even more insecurity of jobs and income and wages for the average working person.""His warning comes as the number of coronavirus cases globally tops five million, with many countries seeing a second wave of infections and struggling to reopen their economies - a key factor in whether economic growth can bounce back quickly.""You can open the stores but the question is whether they're going to come back,"" he says. ""Most of the shopping centres in China are still empty. Half of the flights aren't there. German shops are open but who wants to go and shop?""Emerging Asia though will see better growth than ""other advanced economies.""But there will be a greater split between the US and China, and many Asian countries will be forced to choose between the two superpowers.""Each one of them is going to say to the rest of the world, either you are with us or against us,"" he says. ""Either you use my AI systems, my 5G, my technologies, my robotics. Or you are using the one of my rival's. Therefore there is going to be a more divided world.""Professor Roubini's moniker of Dr Doom was earned after he was famously and consistently negative on the global economy's prospects - even as the US entered a stellar decade of stock market returns.When asked whether holding a negative position for so long meant that at some point he would almost certainly be right, he told me he prefers the name Dr Realist, to Dr Doom.""When everyone said that China was going to have a hard landing in 2015, I said it will be bumpy,"" he told me. ""I've actually been more optimistic than Wall Street was. The people who say I'm a broken clock that is right twice a day have not followed me."" "

11 April 2021,Showcasing a collection of management cases,"The Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), the nation’s management mentor, is delighted to present its pioneering collection of cases based on the projects undertaken by students local and overseas, as “PIM Cases in Management”. It was a collective authorship by my faculty colleagues Dr. A.K.L. Jayawardena, Dr. Samantha Rathnayake, Dr. Ravi Bamunusinghe and myself. Let us discuss the details. Overview Case based learning in management is an effective way of imparting knowledge, skills, and attitude, particularly in postgraduate courses. A case in fact is a story with issues to explore in finding solutions and insights to excel in applying the key lessons. It is a symbol, metaphor, or a parable in one way or another, revolving around people interacting in institutions. In other words, it is a simulation of real life through depiction of planning, organising, leading, and controlling, which are the four key pillars of management. Well-crafted cases enrich us in multiple ways in enhancing our competence and confidence in contributing towards organisational success. These carefully selected cases were primarily prepared by our committed “learning partners” as their final projects, supervised by the PIM faculty, under the guidance of the PIM’s research centre. The cases were further refined and reinforced with additional material with a view to providing a rich platform towards reflective reading, ease of comprehension, rigorous investigation, resound analysis and resourceful application. It is worthwhile stating the essence of each case in identifying the priority management theme in focus. Creating shared value The collection of cases begins with a shared value creation initiative now known as “The English Tea Shop”, with an interesting term “Prajava” derived from the Sinhala language highlighting the community involved. This case revolves around making organic tea for a niche market in an innovative manner. It reveals an entrepreneurial initiative by Mr. Suranga Herath, and the power of “Prajava” in creating shared value, initiated by a transformational leader in action. It is an invitation to discover the significance of demonstrating sustainability, implementing shared value creation and transformational leadership.The input for this case study was from a final year MBA Management Case Study Project submitted to the PIM by a telecommunication engineer at  Mobitel, Lalitha Udayanga.Exploring elegance in elephant dung The second case on Maximus invites us to have a deep understanding of social entrepreneurship, and also to identify the ways of implementing solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues with the discovery of entrepreneurial characteristics. This case revolves around an entrepreneurial firm creating handmade paper and other value-added products out of elephant dung. Maximus with its humble beginnings has come a long way in becoming a dominant player in eco-friendly manufacturing of 100 % recycled products.  The case invites us to have a deep understanding of social entrepreneurship, and also to identify the ways of implementing solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues with the discovery of entrepreneurial characteristics.  The learning partners involved in providing the inputs for this case were , Senior Quality Assurance Lead, Ms. J. B. Amandakoon and Manager, HR Strategies and Policy Section of Cambio Software Engineering, Ms. S. Y. Wijesiri.Mega heights of multi-constructions The third case on Multi-Constructions revolves around visionary leadership, organisational culture, and human resource development (HRD) climate in reaching mega heights. This case reveals the solid success of a leading construction firm with its vibrant leadership in being visionary towards building a sustained competitive advantage. Harping on its strengths and capitalising on its rich human resources, creation of a conducive climate for performance with needed cultural elements are key features. As such, the case revolves around visionary leadership, organisational culture, and human resource development (HRD) climate.It was the MBA final project inputs of  Operations Manager, Refreshments Category, Unilever Sri Lanka, I.L. Ariyarathna and  Head of Procurement, Phoenix Industries, A.M. Sampath used for developing the above case. Enterprise technology sphere The fourth case is about showcasing excellence in the enterprise technology sphere, which focuses our attention to explore innovation in the context of a supportive organisation culture with visionary leadership. This case revolves around the global reach and relevance of a local software developer in the broad area of enterprise platforms. It highlights the power of a persuasive leader in creating a world class organisation providing a variety of web-based solutions. The case hinges on  the significance of a superior support service model as well as an open-source business model. It invites us to explore innovation in the context of a supportive organisation culture with visionary leadership.The learning partner whose inputs were involved was  Head of Product Innovation IT Group of John Keells Computer Services, K.  Chandrasekera.Stormy seasThe fifth case is a success story of a family business involving two generations, and reveals us four learning phases, namely, learning business, learning our family business, learning to lead our business, and learning to let go of our business. This case showcases the success story of a family business involving two generations. It highlights how successful family business leaders understand the progression through two stages, apprenticeship, and stewardship. Optimising the likelihood of business survival requires family businesses to lay forth a workable plan in securing next generation involvement.The inputs from  Manager, Technical Operations and Scrum Master at  Savantis Solutions Lanka,  Poorna Senaratna and  Lecturer at the Department of Management and Finance, Faculty of Management, Social Sciences and Humanities, at the Kotelawala Defence University, Ms. W.D.H. De Mel, were used to develop this case. Banking and Finance The sixth case included in this volume depicts a dedicated institution for the banking and finance studies as a pioneering move in Oman, inviting us to have a deep understanding of the strategic management process, inclusive of an inspiring vision and an implementable action plan. This case involves the establishment of a dedicated institution for banking and finance studies as a pioneering move in Oman. It highlights the power of a vision becoming a reality. How valuable is the right way of crafting and executing strategies is also emphasised through a success story of dynamic growth. The case invites the reader to have a deep understanding of the strategic management process, inclusive of an inspiring vision and implementation plan.The learning partners providing inputs for the development of the above case were  lecturers at the Department of Professional Studies and Undergraduate Studies of the College of Banking and Financial Studies, Muscat, Oman, Mohamed Farzan and H. C. Feroskhan. They in fact represent the richness of the six overseas study groups of PIM in the UAE, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Bangladesh. Baking local delightsThe seventh case is about the Colombo Bakery in the UAE, showcasing the solid presence of seven Ps of marketing, viz. product, price, promotion, place, packaging, positioning, and people. This case revolves around a successful Sri Lankan entrepreneur baking delightful food items in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Colombo Bakery with its humble beginnings has now reached mighty heights with vibrancy of a variety of quality foods at an affordable price with a true Sri Lankan flavour. It highlights the spirit of entrepreneurship whilst showcasing the solid presence of seven Ps of marketing, viz. product, price, promotion, place, packaging, positioning, and people.  Again, it is a delightful input from two overseas learning partners of PIM,  Senior Auditor, Meralis Chartered Accountants, Dubai, Ms. K.A. N. S. Kuruppu and  Associate Director, Head of Trade Services, Al Hilal bank, Abu Dhabi, R.N. Z. Jayman.Serving millions The eighth case involves a multinational giant with a long presence in Sri Lanka providing fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), highlighting the efforts of social marketing. This case revolves around a multinational giant with a long presence in Sri Lanka providing fast moving consumer goods (FMCG). Its continuous growth amidst local competition is a success story of a pioneer with a social marketing focus. Social marketing aims to influence behaviour that benefits individuals and communities for the greater social good. This case illustrates its promising potential, proven over eight decades of serving millions. The MBA final project inputs of  Executive Assistant to HR Director and National Finance Director and Engagement Pillar Lead of Unilever Sri Lanka, Ms. A. S. Jayatunge has been used for this case.    Eggs The ninth case is about a phenomenal progress of an entrepreneurial venture specialising in egg-related food products, namely Raju Omelet, depicting the significance of the need for achievement, risk taking, locus of control, self-efficacy, innovation, proactiveness, and autonomy. The phenomenal progress of an entrepreneurial venture specialising in egg-related food products is the simplest way how Raju Omelet could be described.  It showcases the entrepreneurial orientation of  Rajiv Meherish.  The need for achievement, risk taking, locus of control, self-efficacy, innovation, proactiveness and autonomy which are essential for business growth, especially when operating in a highly competitive hospitality industry, are vividly demonstrated in the road less travelled taken by Raju Omelet in demonstrating business “egg”cellence.Cluster Credit Manager, The Meydan Hotels, Dubai, Ms. R.  S.

13 December 2020,CSBA to double client base in two years,"The Colombo Stock Brokers Association (CSBA), the apex body representing stock broking companies aims to double the active client base within the next two years in its endeavour to create a vibrant stock market. The Association marked a milestone in its journey this year turning 25. “Withstanding turbulent times all through the years has been a hallmark of the Association which is committed to offer a best in class service to investors,”  CSBA President Kosala Gamage said in an exclusive interview with Sunday Observer Business on Friday.The chief of the stock brokers association is determined, though it looks a bit too ambitious, to double the number of active clients from 20,000 to 40,000 by the end of next year or by mid 2022.To get there, he said the Association is working closely with all key stakeholders such as the Colombo Stock Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) and the Government to which CSBA is grateful for accommodating some of its salient proposals in the 2021 Budget  and for the first time assigning a minister to develop the capital market.“Our market is highly discounted with most stocks of blue-chips being undervalued and some even trading at attractive dividend yields. We need to attract at least 1 percent of the total Fixed Deposits which stood around Rs. 6.89 trillion at end 2019 which were getting over 10 percent interest rate though it is now down to around 5 percent to take advantage of undervalued stocks in blue chips and banks,” Gamage said, adding that the current health crisis is not a phenomena unique to Sri Lanka and that what is needed is for investors to stick to principles.In this regard the CSBA chief said the role of the investor advisor community cannot be undermined as it all to do with the hard earned or retirement money of investors which needs to be taken care of with greater responsibility. “Investor advisors have a major role to play especially in dealing with new clients to ensure the money is invested in the right manner,” Gamage said, adding not everyone could be an investor advisor, who has to follow a well designed licensing process. Gamage said 2021 and beyond will be an exciting time as a host of new products are being designed by the CSE for which the CSBA will extend its fullest support.Formed in 1995, the CSBA consists of 18 member firms licensed and regulated by the SEC. The CSBA President said there had been many challenges over the past few years for the industry and the country. However, with the assurance of consistency in policy by the new dispensation we are optimistic of a better future for the industry."
23 May 2021,Seven ‘R’s to review the “Right MBA” in Sri Lanka ,"It is a chaotic time we are going through in combating a contagion. In converting an obstacle to an opportunity, future-oriented managers have started getting more actively involved in sharpening their capabilities.  The qualification titled Master of Business Administration, simply known as MBA has always been a sought-after qualification by managers local and global alike.Though it deals with management rather than administration, the much-accepted popular term is MBA rather than MBM. Today’s column is an attempt to ponder the nature and features of a preferred MBA with Sri Lankan context in mind. Overview The evolution of MBA is an interesting one stemming from the much-criticised scientific management advocated by Henry Taylor and others. It is a response to growing industrialization where the need arose to equip managers with higher knowledge and skills. The conventional approach was to “learning by doing” with more hands-on focus. Yet, the requirement of a formal approach of managerial development was much felt. It was first a Master of Science in Commerce from the Tuck School of Business of Dartmouth College, USA, the predecessor to the MBA. It was in 1908 that the first MBA program emerged from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration, USA.  The term   Executive MBA (EMBA) came to the forefront in 1943 when the Booth School of Business of the University of Chicago offered it for working professionals as opposed to full time students. The first MBA outside the USA emerged in Canada in 1950 where the Ivey Business School of the University of Western Ontario started offering it. It was soon followed by the University of Pretoria in South Africa in 1951. The first MBA offered in Asia is known to be at the Indian Institute of Social Welfare & Business Management (IISWBM) in Calcutta in 1953. This is even before Europe, as the first MBA there began in 1957 at the INSEAD, France. The Sri Lankan scenario with regards to the MBA is an interesting one. It began with the initiatives of the Vidyodaya campus with the Faculty of Arts offering a masters qualification in commerce and finance in the late sixties.A Division of Postgraduate Studies was set up at the Faculty of Management Studies of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura in 1981. There was a solid  collaboration under CIDA with two Canadian Universities, viz., Ottawa University and Carleton University.  The upgrading of it took place in 1986, where the pioneering MBA provider was born as the Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM).Subsequently, the Faculty of Management and Finance of the University of Colombo became the second MBA provider in Sri Lanka. Today, almost all state universities are offering MBAs. Additionally, there are many non-state higher education institutes that also have their own MBAs or franchised ones from overseas universities. Whither MBAs There had been many conversations on the changing face of MBA, the sought-after qualification among managers. It has been hailed as a competency builder on one hand and hacked as a money spinner for mushrooming institutions.I read with interest the constructively critical insights by Dr. Rakesh Khurana on elite Harvard MBA. It reminded me of Henry Mintzberg, the veteran management thinker who was also critical about the typical MBAs on offer.  “From Higher Aims to Higher Hands” is the title of the treatise of Dr. Rakesh Khurana. He shows that university-based business schools were founded to train a professional class of managers in the mold of doctors and lawyers but have effectively retreated from that goal, leaving a gaping moral hole at the center of business education and perhaps in management itself. He clearly calls for reforms in management education. His criticism of Harvard MBA as a “uni-polar” MBA as opposed to being a “multi-polar” MBA is worth reflecting. According to Khurana, a “uni-polar” MBA trains managers to have lucrative carriers in multinationals and large conglomerates. Instead, a “multi-polar” MBA should prepare the candidates in becoming entrepreneurs, setting up SMEs in fostering innovation and partnerships in offering best-cost solutions. It gave me a sense of satisfaction, as the MBA we offer has the scenario of making one out of five of its recipient’s entrepreneurs. In fact, we want to make this ratio doubled through the initiatives of the Business Incubation Centre. The most recent comment on MBAs came from Elon Musk, the dynamic business tycoon of SpaceX and Tesla fame. “There might be too many MBAs running companies.” In his view, the “MBA-isation of America” limits the creation of innovative products and services. Of course, there were many previous criticisms on MBA as well. “Management is a practice. And you learn management by practicing management. Experience is critically important. You do not become a manager in a classroom, and you certainly do not  become a leader in a classroom.Leadership is earned on the basis of people who choose to follow you. It’s not granted or anointed by some holy water granted in a school.” These are the very words of Henry Mintzberg, Professor of Management, at the Desautels Faculty of Management of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. As observed by Harry Costin, “Mintzberg provides a useful distinction between business and management. He argues that MBAs teach the fundamentals of business functions, not the practice of management. What is lost in the discussion is that M.B.A.literally means Master of Business Administration, and therefore, even following Mintzberg’s argument, the degree does not disguise what it is really about.In essence, the term MBA itself is viewed as a misnomer. There is a wave of criticisms on MBAs around the world. Especially after the global credit crunch and the collapse of giants led by MBAs, this negativity has gathered momentum. I myself have heard from CEOs lamenting that some of their MBAs know a lot of theory but sadly lack the practical approach in applying them in real issues. Taking this issue into a broader perspective, an ongoing debate in the USA has even reached a point to say that MBA awarding business schools have an identity crisis. I am confident that we will not allow that to happen to us. Yet, it is better to be proactive than being reactive.Selecting the “Right MBA”There was a time when we ask in selection interviews, whether the candidate is having an MBA. Now, we ask the question from where him/her having one’s MBA. It speaks of volumes with regards to the proliferation of MBAs in Sri Lanka.I will not get into the debate to arguing what is fake and what is authentic with regards to MBAs being offered in Sri Lanka. It is sensible to have a strategic and structured approach in selecting the “right MBA”. I would detach myself being the current leader of the pioneering MBA provider in Sri Lanka, in discussing the nature and features of a preferred MBA. Also, I would take the standpoint of Michel Porter, the strategy stalwart who emphasises that the Best is a subjective term.You can always ask, Best in what? As much as there is a market for a Mercedes Benz, there is a market for Maruti Suzuki.There can also be a Lexus with awesome features at an affordable price. Seven reasons to review Having observed the bouquets and brickbats offered to MBAs offered in Sri Lanka, let me propose seven reasons that will be relevant in selecting the “right MBA”. It is an attempt to shed some light where there is a jungle of confusion, particularly in the new generation with regards to quality, quantity, and quest. ReputationIs the MBA provider a reputed institution? Has it having any accreditation as a recognition of its endeavors’? Association for Advanced Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) is the most prestigious accreditor in the world that has only accredited less than 5 percent of the Business Schools in the World.Ranking is another way of looking at it but owing to many subjectivities, it has a lesser appeal in the Sri Lankan context. The reputation of the resource personnel is of much higher significance here. For example, a person with both corporate experience and scholarly credentials will have a higher appeal. ReliabilityIs the institute that offers the  MBA a stable and sustained one with significant pass success? Has it been consistent in commencing and finishing courses on time? Has it got a panel of resource  personnel who are consistent and continuing? The variation between state sector establishments and  non-state sector players might appear here. RelevanceThis is a critical factor in the Sri Lankan context. As we live in a “glocal” world, we need global reach with local roots. It is a subtle balance that is required to cover both globally and locally relevant contents with continuously being current. RigourThis is a factor that some may overlook for convenience. I go with the adage, “no pains, no gains”. A truly transformational experience requires rigour in forming the MBA learners to unleash their potential.Pacifying them with an easy path and overly marketing the ease and convenience of doing an MBA has created lower standards. ReachA good MBA program provides an opportunity to network with many managers representing multiple fronts. The strength of its alumni speaks volumes of the success of an MBA. This is where the MBA provider can be a “leader- breeder” in having a galaxy of star executives. It is where the words across the business world matter with a preference to an MBA where the majority of top CEOs have done. ResponseThis can be often misunderstood as just customer care. It can be a nuisance to receive SMSs regarding special discounts on MBAs and complementary offers.I would say the crux of the matter deals with releasing results on time, promptly attending to learners’ queries and providing necessary information when requested. A solid backbone of effective administration matters here. ResearchThis is a debatable point around the globe. Sad to note the less emphasis on research by some MBAs making them rather course-driven depriving the learners the opportunity to apply what they have gathered in the classroom to a workplace.Research can appear in many forms, such as case studies, skills-development projects, entrepreneurial projects, puzzle-solving with theoretical frameworks etc.A sound footing on research showcases the significance of an MBA with depth and breadth. When I ask the question, what was your MBA final project and if one struggles to give a clear answer, it clearly shows the level of emphasis on research.The above seven “R”s will give some reasonable insights to review with regards to the “right MBA”. Road aheadAs the revered religious text Dhammapada begins, “Mano Pubbangama Dhamma, Mano Setta Manomaya” (Mind is the forerunner for all success). I am humbly happy that I coined the concept of  MBA as Mind Before Action.It is an invitation to transform from a task executor to a thinking executive. It is also a challenge to shift from a mere practitioner to a mega professional. With a right blend of knowledge-set, skills – set and values-set, the way forward can be indeed promising and productive. The challenge is to select the “right MBA”."
12 April 2020,Small scale rice millers request Govt help to purchase paddy," When there are 20 million people who consume rice in Sri Lanka, three large scale rice mill owners outrageously decide on the prices of paddy, maintaining an unethical monopoly in the market, said small scale rice mill owner of Polonnaruwa, Suraj Jayawickrama.Expressing his views on the paddy and rice monopoly in the market, Jayawickrama said the Government and banks provide very small loans to small scale rice mill owners to purchase paddy. However, they provide a higher number of loans to three large scale rice mill owners, namely, Araliya, New Rathan and Nipuna . Under the pretext of the coronavirus pandemic these leading rice mill owners attempt to purchase paddy and create an artificial shortage in the market and also to fix the price of a kilogram of rice at Rs. 100.He said that even if the small scale rice mills have been declared as an Essential Service they do not have stocks. We are ready to commence our operations within 24 hours and we have enough workers. Therefore, the Government should take immediate steps to provide the rice stocks in Kilinochchi and Jaffna to small scale rice mill owners. We are ready to provide rice at the maximum retail price declared by the Government .At present, the stocks of rice in the districts cannot be transported due to the curfew. Therefore, the Army can intervene and fulfil this task.Three large scale rice mill owners measure their stocks early and store them. Then, we only have the remaining paddy stocks of the farmers to purchase. By this time, the three leading rice mill owners have increased the price of paddy so that any small scale rice mill owner is unable to purchase paddy. This is called the monopoly or the ‘mafia’. Even the banks should be held responsible for this.Jayawickrama said that the Nipuna rice mill owner had told the President on April 9 that the rice mills will have to be closed for 10 days so that a rice shortage would be created in the market. These rice mill owners never close their mills or stop their operations. The Government should immediately take over the stocks of paddy of these large scale rice mill owners. As small scale rice mill owners we would convert the paddy to rice and provide enough stocks of rice as requested by the Government.He said that the Government should intervene to purchase paddy at the next harvest season. Firstly, credit facilities should be given to all rice mill owners to purchase paddy. The Government should also give some targets to small scale rice mill owners regarding the purchase of paddy and the production of rice. At present, there are 5,000 metric tons of paddy purchased by the Divisional Secretaries and the Army. This paddy stock should be distributed equally among small scale rice mill owners. Then we could provide rice for the Government as soon as possible. We are ready to help the Government in this catastrophic situation.The Government should not be scared of these three large scale rice mill owners. There are sufficient rice stocks for the next four months and there is no need to create a rice shortage in the market.He said that the Government should fix the price of a kilo of paddy at Rs. 40 - 45 so that a kilo of rice can be given to the consumer at Rs.80 -85. This would not cause any loss to paddy farmers as well. There are small scale rice mill owners associations in each district. In the Polonnaruwa district alone there are 60 small scale rice mills. Steps should be taken to provide credit facilities to small scale rice mill owners when it is time to reap the harvest. We have enough storage facilities countrywide. Therefore, the Government should not dance to the whims and fancies of these three large scale rice mill owners. We have the ability to compete with them. We are ready to commence our operations within 24 hours and provide quality rice without paving the way to create any rice shortages in the market."
19 September 2021,NCE holds webinar on coconut based exports to the USA,"The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka launched a series of webinars on the theme ‘Grow Beyond Traditional Markets’ in collaboration with Sri Lankan Foreign Missions overseas. The main objective of this initiative is to assist exporters to reach new markets and identify emerging demand for various products and services, under new normal by global consumers.  The Chamber conducted two webinars recently, in coordination with the Sri Lanka embassy in the USA and India Business Group, a chamber of commerce based in Mumbai. The webinar conducted with the support of the Sri Lanka Embassy was mainly focused on improving market access for Sri Lankan coconut and coconut based products.Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha outlined the need to support Sri Lankan SME exporters in reaching out to global consumers. The Embassy has made a strategic move to develop a ‘Warehouse Concept’ supported by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, the first such warehouse being dedicated to the apparel sector.  The expected outcome of this strategic approach is manyfold including meeting customer demand instantly, bridging the time gap between the production and consumption of products, and also obtaining prize utilisation through the creation of time utility.The delays in the supply chain due to the prevailing global catastrophe can also be mitigated to a larger extent through this facility. According to the Ambassador, they have taken steps to set up two such facilities in the East and West Coasts of the United States where exporters can send in their goods in advance, for storage.  In this regard, EDB playing a significant supportive role will provide financial aid for the first six months, he said. He said the role being played by the Embassy, setting a trend in motion, and matchmaking between the seller and the buyer, and warehouse being the hard end of the deal. He also stressed the important role played by the Sri Lankan community and academics in the US who can make connections and provide technical know-how to support Sri Lankan exporters. The Embassy is making every effort to connect such people with exporters to facilitate the process. In this aspect, the Embassy has revived the US-Sri Lanka Chamber of Commerce which had been in defunct mode. He said the untapped potential for coconut-based products in the US and the need to compete effectively with existing suppliers from countries such as India. He requested exporters to establish contact with the US investors for direct investment in the Sri Lankan coconut sector.The Ambassador also highlighted the importance of women’s employment in this sector and said that their contribution was essential for the economic development of the country.Minister Commercial of the Embassy, Sumedha Ponnamperuma made a presentation covering the main areas and requirements of coconut-based products to the USA.The NCE also joined a B2B webinar conducted by the India Business Group, to improve bilateral trade between the two countries. India Business Group (IBG) a Chamber of Commerce based in Mumbai serving the ecosystem of business sectors for the past eight years.IBG is a pioneer chamber in India, representing over 75,000 members. They have signed MoUs with over 30 chambers around the globe and in neighbouring States. During the webinar, members of both Chambers introduced themselves and their businesses and exchanged business referrals and lead generation.  "
25 October 2020,“Triple bottom line should be part of corporate DNA”,"The concept of the triple bottom line, the planet, people, profit, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and all initiatives and programs launched by global and local corporates and business leaders is showcased as a feather in their business cap and not as a part of their business DNA, Chairman and Co-founder, Ath Pavura, Chandula Abeywickrema said in an interview with Sunday Observer Business on Friday. He said this is the reason why there is so much corporate greed among entities world over at the exploitation of key stakeholders. The post Covid-19 world has amplified unsustainable and irresponsible revenue generation by corporates which are responsible for numerous issues and challenges faced by the society, increasing economic inequality, widening the gap between the rich and poor and causing environmental degradation.Any business entity be it global corporate giants, local business conglomerates or SMEs need to recognise that they are part of the planet and that if the environment that they exist in is affected there is no possibility they survive on their own.Therefore, any business entity should be aware that there are number of important equal stakeholders that support the business entity such as shareholders that will let private capital flow, employees who are the driving force of the business, customers who pays value to the purchase of the solutions presented by the businesses, and the society and the fabric of the environment that any businesses stands on.“It is very clear now that Covid-19 has thrown all to the deep end, we need to go beyond approach of triple bottom line, Planet , People, Profit to a quadruple bottom line to articulate and mandate the business corporate to work on the fourth P which is the progress of the planet and the people.“The business corporates need to have the conviction, unless the profit they make out of the planet and the people are now ploughed back to the progress of the planet and the people there is no business sustainability and continuity.“Profit with a purpose has much wider and greater inclusivity, showcasing that the profit generated is now beneficial and impacts all stakeholders,” Abeywickrema said.The leadership of the business entities at the very outset lays the framework for KPI that will translate to showcase the profit with a purpose. Return on Investment (ROI) for each of the stakeholders, the shareholders, employees, customers, society and the Planet rightfully enshrined and no stakeholder is exploited and sacrificed to the benefit of the other.Before Covid-19, most of the business conglomerates globally and locally and numerous other business entities greatly focused and worked on the top line and the bottom line. But when Covid-19 hit, except for some of the leading tech and tech-retail giants, all industry sectors were affected. They are no longer advocating the top line and the bottom line but the Life Line to Survive, Sustain and Surge ahead.In a living ecosystem there is the existence of species of different shapes and sizes from, nano, micro, small and medium, big and large, which are interdependent , integrated and interwoven, and when one is affected all get impacted.The Covid-19 lockdown, first affected the informal sector of nano and micro entrepreneurs and thereafter the rest, SMEs, large and small corporates.It is now very evident without the Life Line running throughout the fabric of the ecosystem touching entrepreneurs from nano, to micro, to SME to large and corporate, strategising on a top line and the bottom line is not sustainable.If the profit that is generated by using the planet and the people are not ploughed back to the progress of the planet and the people there is no sustainability.Profit with a Purpose (PwP) for Responsible Business Sustainability and Continuity will transcend businesses and entrepreneurs to be more responsible to enhance, empower and enrich society economically. "

22 August 2021,CSE implements DVP settlement mechanism ,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) implemented the Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) settlement mechanism on August 16.The Open Auction call session of the  CSE was from 12.15 pm to 1.00 pm.The pre-open was extended to provide more time for order entry in view of the transition to the upgraded systems. The Open Auction was at 1.00 pm and Regular Trading commenced thereafter.  The commencement of the pre-open session was delayed due to one Broker system vendor having technical difficulties in connecting to the exchange.The CSE decided to postpone the market opening until the system vendor was normalised, thereby giving the chance for all market participants and investors to participate in the trading session given the importance of the transition to the DVP environment.The CSE will investigate the vendor’s issues and will take action to prevent a recurrence.The market closed at 2.30 pm recording a turnover of Rs 834.43 million within a limited period of 90 minutes. "
8 December 2019,CSE Chairman expects rally in the market,"The tax concessions augur well for the investor community which had been awaiting relief to boost investment in the capital market which is now on an upward growth trajectory said Colombo Stock Exchange Chairman Ray Abeywardhane at the bell ringing ceremony to mark two years of collaboration between the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) last week. He said the fiscal stimuli package introduced recently comes at a very appropriate time for the CSE and added that the move will stimulate investments and boost the performance of the stock exchange. “Investors needed some relief from a host of taxes which discouraged them from entering the market. We hope to see a rally in the market with more trading in stocks and other investment instruments,” Abeywardhane said.The Cabinet made a slew of tax amendments last week - among them are the reduction in Value Added Tax (VAT) from 15 to eight percent.However, the tax reductions are also seen as a move that could widen the budget deficit which according to the finance Minister is expected to be around seven percent this year.The fiscal stimulus package also comes amidst staggering external debt repayments amounting to over US$ 3 billion annually up to 2024, and a widening trade deficit.“Sustainable investing has continued to gain momentum among financial market participants and Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) factors are vital determinants of investment decisions. As this requirement comes into the fore, it is vital that listed entities take steps to effectively measure and communicate ESG performance and impacts to its stakeholders,” Abeywardhane said.CSE and GRI marks two years of collaboration focused on providing guidance to listed companies on ESG disclosures and enhance corporate transparency.The collaboration has been successful in engaging Sri Lankan listed companies to understand their obligations on sustainability reporting and identify and deliver the technical assistance and capacity building needed to improve awareness on sustainability reporting.GRI Chief Executive Tim Mohin in his message said the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards help companies use transparency to create social, environmental and economic benefits for everyone.The GRI is an international independent standards organization that helps businesses, governments and other organizations understand and communicate their impacts on issues such as climate change, human rights and corruption.First launched in 2000, GRI’s sustainability reporting framework is now widely used by multinational organizations, governments, small and medium enterprises (SME), NGOs and industry groups in more than 90 countries. In 2017, 63 percent of the largest 100 companies (N100), and 75 percent of the Global Fortune 250 (G250) reported applying the GRI reporting framework.The Australian High Commission in Sri Lanka which has supported GRI and its activities in Sri Lanka has been a key stakeholder of the partnership between CSE and GRI.The Australian High Commissioner David Holly said that while sustainability reporting also paves the way for companies here in Sri Lanka to demonstrate to the world a commitment to be a part of the solution to address climate change concerns.Senior GRI coordinator for South Asia, Rubina Sen said, “Since 2018, GRI and CSE worked closely and has developed resource material such as the ESG guidance document to support listed companies in Sri Lanka.” "
10 May 2021,Importance of cyber liability insurance,"Many business people mistakenly think their general liability insurance will protect them in the event of a cyber attack. In most cases, it won’t, and the losses can be devastating. That’s why cyber insurance is important.It’s vital for insurance brokers to understand cyber risk, a complex type of exposure, and convey risks and solutions to clients.Cyber insurance could potentially cover something as calculated and criminal as ransomware attacking a business, or as simple as individual internet use, online commerce, or even personal data exposure from a lost mobile phone. Cyber insurance policies are critical because they provide coverage specific to cybercrime losses. We in Sri Lanka are not immune to cyber attacks as seen recently with the .lk cyber attack, and documented attacks to some banks in Sri  Lanka due to this phenomenon.What does cyber liability insurance cover?Cyber liabilityCyber liability insurance is an important type of insurance designed to specifically cover expenses, business losses, business interruption, and fines and penalties should a data breach happen to a business. Cyber liability insurance also protects businesses in the event of a ransomware attack.It is written to cover losses that other policies will not cover.Who needs cyber insurance?The short answer: everyone. Every business that uses electronic communication and/or the internet should protect their business from a potentially terrible event, that could be very costly and could harm a business’ brand or reputation.Cyber risk is realAlmost everyone uses some kind of cyber technology every day. In an era when your four-year-old can navigate your smartphone like a toy, email and texting are prevalent, and businesses conduct activity and transactions online, the cyber world is a bustling mega centre of communication and commerce. For criminals, cyberspace is the land of opportunity.Businesses now consider the risk of cyber liability losses to exceed the risk of fraud or theft. In this tumultuous environment, your business can take several steps to limit risks, including purchasing cyber liability insurance. It is only one tool in the overall risk mitigation tool box. Given that smaller institutions are at a disadvantage when it comes to having the resources to thwart sophisticated attacks, it might also be helpful for smaller banks with limited resources to focus on three control areas that can provide some of the biggest bang for their buck against cyber criminals.Mind the (insurance) gapSmart companies are evaluating risks across their enterprises and creating ways to safeguard themselves. These efforts include conducting cyber risk assessment, training employees in best online practices and how to recognise phishing attempts, creating ransomware-attack procedures, and using sophisticated programs to protect their data.And of course, purchasing cyber attack coverage is very important.It is in this backdrop that we address the issues that could affect a Bank, a Financial Institution or for that matter any business that is functioning in cyberspace.Cyber insurance provides three  important instant benefits.* Cyber health check* Financial assistance in the face of attack* Incident reporting anytime and free incident response within 72 hours.Cyber health check.Most cyber insurers require an assessment to help determine the insurance company’s risk in the underwriting process. Think of it like the physical exams that some life insurance policies require. If organisations use a sound assessment methodology that includes real-world adversarial simulations—beyond just paper-based reviews—banks can identify the biggest cyber risks and the gaps it needs to prioritiseFinancial assistance Like any insurance policy, cyber insurance can provide peace of mind — the kind you get from knowing that the insurance company will cover certain losses.These could include the costs of ransom payments, paying for customer credit freezes and reports, regulatory fines, legal defence and other costs.Incident reporting Cyber attacks genuine or threats, aborted or threats needs an instant response team to mitigate and arrest the arising losses. The first incident reporting and response teams effort and services of up to 72 hours will be free of cost to the insured.Cyber security, the evolving riskWhether it be considering economic impacts and ramifications; supply-chain management; dealing with cyber security risks; enterprise and operational risk management; business  continuity and enterprise resilience Covid-19 is proving to be one of the most globally  significant stress tests of organisational, community and individual resilience ever.  * Risk in cyber cycle data breach and incident management coverage (first party)* Cyber extortion coverage (first party), reputation risk coverage (first party) network security* Liability coverage (third party), privacy breach liability coverage (third party) confidentiality * Breach Coverage (third party), fraudulent funds (first party), business interruption coverage (first party), failure to supply coverage (third party), media liability coverage (third party).* Outsourcing coverage (first and third party), privacy breach protection coverage (first party)*  Additional covers - dependent business interruption, and cyber terrorism.

Malware, Phishing, Man-in-the-middle attack, Denial-of-service attack, SQL injection, Zero-day exploit and DNS Tunneling are said to be the common types of cyber-attacks ?III. If a bank current or savings account or credit card is hacked and funds lost, will the bank cover the whole loss or are there limits?The bank will bear the whole cost.IV.   Which insurance companies are involved in providing cover for cyber risks for the banking system? Are there specialist insurance companies for cyber?There are many internationally active re insurance companies available in the market.V.   Do you have recent examples of attacks on the banking industry, loss suffered and cover provided by Insurers?Cases on large banks abroad are many. A cyber attack on Union Bank of India last July began after an employee opened an email attachment releasing malware that allowed hackers to steal the State-run bank’s data. The losses were mounting to 171 mn. USD. But slowly the bank could retrieve some amount of the losses.There are at least three Sri Lankan Banks which had to avert Cyber attacks recently. Almost all financial institutions have experienced a cyber attack in one form or another, and the number of attacks is only increasing. Financial firms are 300 times more likely than other institutions to experience such attacks.Fears of a major cyber attack on banks have been rising since hackerssuccessfully stole nearly $100 million from Bangladesh’s central bank in February 2016. Shortly afterwards, Russian central bank officials disclosed that hackers stole more than $31 million (two billion rubles at the time) from the country’s central bank and commercial banks.VI.   What can you advise anyone interested in crypto accounts such as Bitcoins?

What type of insurance policy would you recommend for Cyber –attack, Third Party Or comprehensive – exactly what risks are covered? There is no policy called a Third Party or a First Policy in Cyber Insurance. A cyber Insurance policy usually picks up both losses. Hence the defence cost, Third party liability and business interruption are covered in a cyber insurance policy.VIII. On what basis are the premiums computed?These are all annual insurance contracts. Premium is charged on an annual basis.IX. Is it common for an attack to be handled internally within the bank, or is it more often handed over to a specialist firm to control the event? What process is recommended by you?Such cases are always handled by the forensic IT specialists.X.  Both the HDFC Bank and SBI in India revealed in their annual reports that they have cyber security Policies providing up to $100 mn. in cover, but did not disclose the cost of the premium – is this what banks in Sri Lanka   should anticipate and hypothetically what would such cover cost in terms  of annual premiums?The current cover for SBI is about 120 mn. USD for this year. The limit of indemnity is high because the kind of data and transaction that they handle is humongous.  The Premium is something not advisable to disclose.  This would largely depend on the risk exposure of the Bank.For a $10 million insurance policy, the premium could mount up to $ 2.5 million (approx).  XI. The new post Covid-19 work environment has moved to working from home – does such off- site work increase risk from cyber attack resulting from unsecure home networks – is such off-site work being priced in new policies?The policy covers all such risks. There are no such exclusions in off-site work scenarios so far. XII. What is the position of the Regulator in terms of Insurance for the Banking system- is Cyber Insurance mandatory as in other jurisdictions?  In India it is mandatory. Other countries are looking into it, particularly in the Asian market.XIII.  In Sri Lanka is there any insurance company that can be regarded as a specialist in cyber risk?The answer is that there is such specialist expertise in the domestic insurance market.xiv. What limit of insurance should I get?”Current market benchmarks in SL:* Corporates IT based overseas exposure - $ 3-5 m* Banks & FIs - $ 3-10 m* Large banks in the region including India $ 100–250 m.The answer is “depends”. The limits you need to purchase will depend on the number of sensitive records you store, the type of the data and other tools you use to minimise the fallout from the data breach.It’s essential to really understand the data that you store and the information systems you use to grasp the full picture of what you stand to lose if the breach happens. The writer is the Chairman of an insurance broking company."

28 June 2020,Offer hope to consumers through brands,"The Covid-19 pandemic has made it arguably more important than ever for marketeers to measure the value of every bit of advertising they do. The economic outlook is gloomy, finance departments are worried and limited marketing budgets are under scrutiny.Yet, direct marketing in Sri Lanka has its own problems. Many companies are struggling to fulfil orders on time or running out of stock, while others simply have nothing to sell. That would make brand marketing a more sensible option than direct response right now. I had a personal experience where a pioneer online marketeer took 11 days to deliver a product whereas the promise was ‘delivery within 48 hours’.As every walk of economic as well as social life has been severely impacted globally by this unexpected catastrophe, it would be unthinkable to imagine that the marketing domain in general and branding and consumer behaviour in particular would remain unscathed.The dynamics of demand is poised to alter at least in the short run. The reduced income would force the majority of consumers to practice self-imposed austerity. Producers may need to re-customise their products to survive. As an obvious and major psychological toll of the pandemic of this scale and scope, consumers more than ever before are likely to remain risk averse.Consumers would expect more mindfulness from brands in these testing times by addressing the larger issue than being opportunistic. They expect brands to communicate around the company’s purpose, values and commitment to consumer wellbeing.This trend is expected to prevail after the pandemic too. One would expect that instead of resorting to product push strategies, large established brands will gravitate to empathetic communication to connect with consumers on a deeper level.On the contrary, smaller brands and new age startups will focus on bottom of the funnel content to push for direct results.Irrespective of the vintage of brands, the age of ‘service with a smile’ has truly arrived and that alone will define the success of brands. In parallel, one would guess that brands will adopt a ‘cautiously optimistic approach’ that will shape their growth.The new consumer demands emanating from the changed scenario are not catered to nor are they being satisfied fully through the offerings by marketeers.In a crisis situation such as this, two kinds of consumer needs viz., need for affiliation and need for change are inevitable.These needs arise due to social distancing. Customers during the lockdown were looking for experiences that were newer and varied to escape the monotony of limited social interaction and movement.This is where the creativity and ingenuity of marketeers was put to the test. Now, they have to discern and uncover ways and means to reach consumers.As an immediate fallout of the pandemic, a sudden spurt in the buying and consumption of at least daily essentials such as groceries, medical supplies and supplements in the short-run was spurned by panic buying.However, consumers may exhibit a ‘wait and watch’ attitude to buy consumer durables and luxuries.When consumers are allowed to pivot from the status quo, they will try out new consumption patterns and test out new things in the altered conditions.For instance, there would be a steep spike in demand for newer and emergent teaching-learning processes as teachers and the taught are left with no other choice.Other examples are soliciting the advice of medical professionals and legal consultants online which consumers were earlier hesitant to do.In the post-Covid consumer psychology, brand perceptions are bound to change when marketeers strategically attempt to bring about positive impressions in consumers towards the brands they promote and make such impressions sustainable for competitive advantage in the long-run.Digital marketingIn the emerging context, digital marketing apparently has increased potential to track and unearth the psyche of the consumers by leveraging the power of data analytics. Most consumers today are glued to the TV, active on social media, and view long videos online.Any data, statistics, and analytics related to consumer’s home-bound activities would provide insights into their changed consumption habits for effective targeting. For instance, millennials today do not wish to watch whatever is aired in general but prefer to be selective in the choice of ads that are put up on the medium they use.Hence, brands should search for and focus on alternate means on digital platforms. Small businesses can make use of more affordable yet very powerful Twitter, WhatsApp and FB for commercial purposes all the more now than ever before. Brands that craft messages that are value oriented and compassionate may achieve better mileage. Social listening can help track the changes in consumer perceptions and preferences. Companies which invest their time and money to keenly observe and follow signals on social media through comments, favourable and critical, stand to gain.OpportunitiesThis crisis has created an opportunity for brands to instantly go virtual which in a normal scenario would have taken years. Brands need to think like a customer and try to assess the emotional upside they may be experiencing in these turbulent times. Societal Marketing Perspective maintains that companies are better off in a stronger, healthier society that incorporates ethical behaviour and social responsibility. Hence, brands should not focus on short term gains but see how they emerge as socially responsible.Brands can explore opportunities even in times of adversity by strengthening their social media presence. Intelligent use of data and analytics would help marketeers take evidence-based decisions in the realm of consumer behaviour. It is important for brands to assess, with the help of analytics, whether the use of the term Covid and its context is actually helpful in market communication.At present, what the marketeers should be focusing on is not merely surviving but maintaining consumers’ perceptions through successful positioning strategies to build and sustain a credible brand image far beyond the crisis. The post pandemic era will test the true resilience of brands and their ability to scale.Those which anchor communication around fundamental messaging and align strategies quickly, will pierce through and witness monumental growth.Human beings, for all the million years of evolution, believe in one thing – something to hold on to, perhaps faith or love or the hope for a better tomorrow and that’s what’s shaped us. It’s time for brands to look up and deliver that message. "
18 October 2020,"Sales knowledge, vital in business","In any commercial entity, the sales team plays perhaps the most important role in the success of the business operation.The most essential and unique role of the sales team members is to bridge the gap between the customers’ needs and the product or service offered by the organisation to fulfill that need. Unlike in the past where the salesman was an aggressive persuader and a product expert, the modern salesman has evolved to be a business consultant and an advisor who provides maximum value to the customer.Let us discuss some of the key application areas, responsibilities and traits needed in the sales role.The sales role is related to a number of different types of activities in an organisation with many varieties and options. Each role has different parameters for success such as skills, experience, and other needs depending on the function of the team member.Therefore, when a person decides that he or she wants to be in sales, a decision has to be made at the beginning of the career, which role would be the best and the most suitable based on the person’s own analysis. For that, the entrant must understand the differences of the functions to determine where the skills apply to obtain the best results.Internet eraSales lead conversion is one of the most important aspects of the sales role. In this internet era, most often, the sales team is communicating to prospects that are already aware of the product they want to purchase and also the competition that prevails. Usually, customers know the details of the company through internet data and the advertising efforts of the organisation. Hence, the job of the salesperson is to offer further information and secure the deal.In an organisation, salespeople interact directly with prospects and has the advantage of obtaining personal knowledge about them. This will assist the salesperson to present the sales pitch exactly suited to the prospect that has the expertise of the salesperson in the customer’s opinion, creating credibility and trust.The building of loyalty and trust between the customer and the business is another key aspect related to the sales role. Loyalty, and trust are two of the main reasons for a customer to make a purchase and recommend the company to a third party. If these two factors are in place properly, they can even be persuaded to offer personal recommendations, reviews, and referrals.Reliable third party references and recommendations are always regarded highly by the potential customers in any business and carry more integrity than any paid advertisement. Particularly, in this digital age, perceptions of a customer can be immensely influential due to the reach of digital media. Therefore, the approach of the customer in building customer trust is a vitally important part of the sales job role.Creating and continuing long-lasting relationships provide tremendous long term benefits to a company. Retaining an existing customer is much cheaper than attracting a new one. The impact a salesperson makes on a first-time customer is supposed to last as long as possible in any type of business. The interaction between the salesperson is probably more useful to future business than even good service delivery. The proper performance of a salesman leads to repeat sales and enhances the brand image.Switching of suppliersTherefore, customer retention is considered another one of the most essential aspects of a commercial organisation. Often customers simply switch suppliers without even complaining if they are unhappy with the after-sales service of the company. The sales role comes into effect in these situations as most customers communicate with the salesman if the relationship is good. Customers mostly prefer the attention and the feedback of the salesperson who served them, if the salesman has built up an adequate relationship.The traditional method of face to face selling that is done outside the office, also known as field sales, is performed by the sales staff. This role is probably the most effective in my personal opinion with my long experience as a field salesperson. Although this is more challenging as a role, a field salesman has other factors that make the job more compelling than other functions of selling. Particularly, the independence and freedom, own day and journey planning, less boredom, less supervision, and many other positive factors are available for a field salesman.However, a field salesperson must be more self-motivated and goal-oriented than others as they typically work in harder conditions.Inside sales, usually mostly related to retail store selling, is another important sales role where the team member has to maintain the customer relationship aspect as the first contact point in a retail operation. A retail salesperson’s main responsibility is to build a strong business relationship with the visiting customer. Also, a key duty of an inside salesperson is to make sure that the customer remains with the organisation continuously, after the first visit.Vital rolesSales support or back-office sales operation functions are other vital roles in sales. This team of people in a sales department provides important details when and where necessary to the direct sales staff.This is a dynamic role in a marketing organisation that helps to reduce costs. Usually the support team assists in investigating leads, creating customer profiles, and analysing other information in support of the sales effort.Customer services are a strong sales job role where the staff is primarily responsible for continuous customer satisfaction. Long-term retention of a new customer is in the hands of the customer service team. This is a multi-tasking function where the staff performs the role of helpers, advisors, problem solvers, advocates, therapists, and more. Most often, the customer care team enters the operation after a sale is completed and the job role is challenging as customers’ complaints and issues are primarily managed by this team.Business development is another key role in sales. The staff is tasked to bring in new business by using various strategies. The tasks are to identify new customers, pitching products or services, and maintain a good relationship with customers for enhanced revenue.Their priority is to assist the organisation to acquire new customers and sell additional products. This is a crucial role for companies to expand or diversify the business.Some organisations recruit account managers to manage accounts where continuous sales revenue is assured. Their job role is to provide individual service to make sure that the customer remains with the company as long as possible.They usually act as overall consultants to the customer and provide all the services. There is no controversy in stating that sales is the most important role of an organisation for survival and growth. Revenue generated by the sales team provides the cash flow of the company.Revenue generation activity is the lifeblood of the organisation as all other criteria including all important budgeting are based on the revenue, invariably produced by the sales team. "
20 June 2021,Creativity in entrepreneurship,"Creativity at any stage of a business allows an entrepreneur to detach from the accustomed norms and move into uncharted and unexplored territories in the market. Hence developing creative skills in every aspect of a business has to be widened by entrepreneurs, both start-ups and experienced. Innovation is produced by creativity and by bringing unconventional ideas to the table, the entrepreneur can bring assured business success. Several salient factors make creativity in the entrepreneurial process leading to the success of an organisation.  First among them is the creation of subjective innovative ideas of the entrepreneur. The process of entrepreneurship revolved around the exploration of new ideas of an individual that can make the business stay ahead of the competition.  Creativity in business simply is the capacity of imagination of the individual. The intention, imagination, and ingenuity are factors associated with creativity that produces different businesses or products from what is already available. Imagination should cross all limitations and boundaries that go beyond the box. The creative thinker always fearlessly thinks outside the frame to replace what is traditional with a new idea. In today’s fiercely competitive markets, the products and services can be accessed with ease. The businessman entering into the competition must be aware of the basic factors such as the precise needs of the consumer, competition he has to confront, the marketable price, costs involved in other aspects of the company, and so forth. Lucrative resultsThe answers to all above exist in a creative mind. Creativity helps the entrepreneur to improve business practices and produce more lucrative results. Regardless of the prevailing customer preference of a product, it can be improved further in different angles if a person thinks imaginatively.  Rehearsed thinking can come up with unthinkable ideas and bring innovation to any business or brand. However, the creative mind of the entrepreneur alone is not sufficient to succeed. He or he should also possess or learn business skills such as how to establish a new venture and manage it.  The business model should be designed with strategies to support and execute in the first place. When the administrative aspects are in place properly, the execution of created innovative ideas is more successful.An entrepreneur should also adhere to rules and principles when they add creative value to the business in order to attract more customers. They should act on any idea, irrespective of the foreseen effectiveness; carefully and initially practice such an idea with caution. They should experiment first, learning from the experience, before actually applying the idea into practice. A salient fact to remember is that any creative new business idea has a certain risk of failure. Analysing such risk to find alternatives is also included in entrepreneurship creativity.The entrepreneur must not be afraid of a failure of a new and ground-breaking idea. They only have to assess the ratio of success or failure before executing the idea. Believing in oneself implicitly is the key to success in business. Hence, initiating action on a new business scheme, new improvement to an existing product, a new method of marketing is totally acceptable. DiversificationInnovative diversification is another area of creative thinking in business. Many entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka have become tremendously successful by diverting their businesses into alien territories. For example, historical business brands in Sri Lanka such as Maliban, Nawaloka, Munchee, DSI, and many other ventures became successful due to the creative minds and fearless decision-making on diversifications by their respective founders. The admirable fact is that most of these Sri Lankan business greats were not highly educated individuals but almost everyone possessed brilliant and creative mindsets. Diversification of a business is not always about infusing more capital but mere imaginative thinking.  Resourceful entrepreneurs find new markets and new opportunities or even create new niches simply through their out-of-the-box thinking. Inventive thinkers can successfully create new products for existing services or new services for existing products. Being alert about everything that takes place around you and learning different things, regardless of whether they are related to the business line or not, can make an individual reach business success. Good businessmen learn from others and seek improvements rather than concentrating on their own perfection. They learn to become flexible and accept success or failure on equal terms. Those who fear failure will not take risks on a new idea and probably fail to spot opportunities throughout their careers. SuccessCreativity and entrepreneurship skills form a perfect combination for the success of an organisation. In today’s advanced environment, creativity and imagination have become integral components of business acumen. In any organisation, proprietary interest and resourcefulness is compulsory and the lack of these two aspects can drag a business to a stagnant mode.The common notion that people need only intelligence and courage to achieve everything they need is obsolete now and has become a misconception. Along with many other aspects, creativity and innovativeness are essential traits in entrepreneurial success. However, regrettably, most of the learning institutions teach more on methods and intelligence than innovative thinking, perhaps because of the immeasurability in creativeness. Nevertheless, business leaders now realise that creative thinkers in their teams can be game-changers in their respective businesses and they set forth an important reason for overall success.  Exploiting employee potential to the optimum capacity is essential in an organisation. By encouraging and inspiring the workforce creativity is also part of entrepreneur imagination and skill. Innovative and explosive ideas can be harnessed through the individual workers in a company for long-term success if the leader approaches them fittingly. By stimulating the team members of an organisation, amazing results can be achieved.  Day-to-day activityCreativity can be of immense help in problem-solving in business. Solving an omnipresent simple critical problem and making a decision on the best available alternative is a day-to-day activity in any business entity. A creative way of thinking and analysing the problem and finding the most suitable decision is imperative to an entrepreneur.A problem can be solved either by taking a common mediocre action or creatively inventing a solution that can give more appropriate solutions.  There are several types of characteristics in creativity in entrepreneurship.An individual who is always purposeful and carrying a huge amount of knowledge possesses deliberate and cognitive creativity.They use their knowledge, abilities, and skills to achieve a predetermined goal. This type of entrepreneur is particularly good at analysing situations, experimenting, and solving problems in any business situation. They develop creativity by their superior knowledge about the subject obtained by studying it for a long period.Others become creative by being sensitive in nature. They become creative deliberately and emotionally and require a longer time to make decisions in business. Nevertheless, usually, their decisions often are more rational and logical. People with spontaneous creativity find successful solutions by reacting to a situation promptly. Such decisions can go wrong at times, yet this type of entrepreneur is a bold risk-taker and they do not fear failure or disappointment.Creative entrepreneurs bring unconventional and daring ideas to the business world. They most often do away with traditional and regular thinking and challenge the standard systems. Created by Steve Jobs who is recognised as the pioneer of the personal computer, ‘Apple’ has changed the mental image and the concept of a phone forever by creating the iPhone. Creative entrepreneurs constantly attempt to think differently and create something different and non-existent.They show that they are different from the competition by standing out in the market.  "

25 April 2021,NCE and Lankan US Embassy to boost Lanka’s access to US market,"The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) is partnering with the Sri Lanka Embassy in Washington DC (SLEMB/DC) to better inform Sri Lankan exporters regarding evolving trends in the US market and strategies that could help navigate challenges and overcome bottlenecks.At a webinar recently, over 40 Sri Lankan exporters, engaged with 10 business entrepreneurs identified by SLEMB/DC, following its State level interactions of the recently constituted Overseas Sri Lankans (OSL) Network.The event was also live streamed through social media. It was agreed to conduct sector specific dialogues, where the Sri Lankan exporters will be provided the opportunity to engage in discussion with the business community of the particular sector, to foster mutually beneficial trading relationships.A separate event is proposed as a dialogue to enhance long-term trade relationships between the two countries. Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to the USA, Ravinatha Aryasinha said, while increasing the value of apparel exports to the US, a concerted effort is presently being made to diversify the export product basket to US.He said while the USA has remained the largest single buyer of Sri Lanka’s exports since 1979 and in 2019 had a share of 26.3% of all exports, the products basket to the US had seen very little diversification. Apparel has been the dominant export item accounting for 74.5% of the total value, and did not benefit from GSP facility. The rest which enjoyed GSP, were mainly rubber based products which accounted for 7%, and the other products included tea, iron and steel articles, activated carbon, precious and semi-precious stones and sea food.The Embassy was reaching out to the OSL community in the US and to Americans interested in doing business with Sri Lanka and helping them in identifying the products which they could import from Sri Lanka to the US. The discussion that followed led by Chairman of the NEC, Shiham Marikkar, focused on obstacles faced by importers when importing from Sri Lanka and the need to adapt to e-commerce marketing strategies to increase exports.SLEMB/DC Minister (Commercial) Sumedha Ponnamperuma shared insights on the introduction of the US market, import system and current trends.Sri Lankan professionals residing and doing business in USA shared insights regarding the current market conditions and the opportunities available.The discussion also focused on the prospects for collaboration between the NCE and the reactivated US-Sri Lanka Chamber of Commerce. Dilan Ariyawansa of the US-Sri Lanka Chamber, elaborated on the role they proposed to play in the future in the furtherance of two-way trade and investment between the US and Sri Lanka. Some of the key highlights of the discussion were:* The US is a highly competitive market due to the size of the market and the prominence in the world economy, therefore the businesses often dominate the trading terms. It is important for exporters to understand this background when negotiating their business, and be well prepared to face challenges.The Customs system and the import structure is complex. Importers operate separately from the vendors.• Importers face challenges when importing from Sri Lanka due to issues arising in quality, commitment and seriousness of exporters. Lack of knowledge on the regulations in the US market was also highlighted.• Discussing the GSP scheme, it came to light that the US GSP for Sri Lanka has expired on December 31, 2020 and currently the US Congress is in the process of deciding the next phase of GSP Scheme for all countries. Sri Lankan exporters are requested to submit their suggestions to be included in the GSP eligible product list, when it comes for review of the scheme later this year.More people prefer online shopping to physical stores and USA is a price sensitive market with high competition from China and Bangladesh. However, consumers are concerned regarding purchases from China, and this could be a positive opportunity for the Sri Lankan exporters in the sector. Another noteworthy change that has occurred in this sector is the reduction of stock turn-around time, as the consumers change their preference rapidly, unlike in the past.• Focusing on logistics, strategically locating businesses activities are important to ensure delivery on right time in right quantities, hence focusing on the timing and direction.The East Coast is one the convenient areas to reach the market, given the times and the convenience in reaching from Sri Lanka.The USA cities are connected with a rail road; therefore, it takes three to 10 days generally. For exporters hoping to expand in e-commerce, the 19 to 20 days’ transit time has to be considered and for exporters of smaller shipments, especially LCLs, it is important to select transit locations wisely to reap the best benefits of market opportunity. The NCE is coordinating with all Sri Lankan Missions and their trade officers to create awareness on new market needs. Plans have been made to conduct a series of webinars, to provide valuable informative insights to the exporters and connect them to stakeholders.The Chamber invites exporters to team up with the chamber’s initiative to expand market access.Interested exporters could contact the chamber via [email protected]."

8 March 2020,Leadership ranks first in management success,"Although there are many definitions and interpretations in terms of leadership, in my long experience in business as a follower and a leader, I find that leadership is a process in which an individual attempts to influence the activities of another in matter of importance in a given situation.Personality and leadership ability play a more important role in business and management success than subject knowledge.Many successful large conglomerates with broad and diversified business lines are led by a single person, often with knowledge of one or a few chosen subjects. These business leaders always have a strong and confident viewpoint, customarily with people skills.Leadership is an influencing process. Therefore, leaders, irrespective of the number of subordinates, must understand and get to know each person’s motivation factor. Also the leader must predict how subordinates will respond to leadership attempts and to adjust the efforts to influence the followers from situation to situation.There are five sources of leadership power. They are, the legitimate power given by the organisation as the position, Reward Power: the ability to reward subordinates, Coercive Power: the ability to punish subordinates, Expert Power: expertise, knowledge and skills of the leader and finally Referent Power which is the followers’ attitude towards the leader. All five criteria are equally important depending on the given situation.Among many theoretical leadership styles, throughout my career, I have always practised what is known as the situational theory as the best approach.This means that the leader analyses the situation and selects the best style of leadership where the inter-relation between the leader and the followers is effective as both find themselves in the same situation.The framework I identified was instrumental behaviour where the leader plans, organises, coordinates and controls subordinate action. Extending support to the task, participating by sharing information and using their suggestions in decision making, not only improves the result but also establishes mutual trust.The leader’s personality, aims and experience show his approach and behaviour styles such as instructing, persuading, participating and delegating according to the task and the situation they are in.He should understand individual characteristics and behavioural patterns, objectives and level of performance of each subordinate.The leader should also consider the same criteria of the group they are involved with. Finally, he should consider the situation, the task at hand, organisational factors, problems and the pressure of time.As in democratic/participative leadership style, instead of controlling behaviour we have analysed, it is best to empower followers and motivate them. It is also useful to genuinely trust your subordinates and establish that trustworthiness before events test it.A good practice is delegation of powers, by encouraging decentralisation and the sharing of ideas. Effective flow of lateral communication with subordinates is imperative to establish a lasting and successful leader and follower reciprocation.Charisma is a deadly leadership trap. Most people think charisma is vital for leadership or is an important trait for a leader. This mannerism not only dilutes the judgement and rational decision making but also can be misread as emotional manipulation.Charismatic people draw more attention than others. That is why others naturally assume that they are capable leaders. However, this is not always the case. When it comes to executive leadership, charisma alone can produce negative results and often can be dangerous due to incapability of respectfully reasoning with followers.In business leadership, motivation is coextensive. Motivation is a goal oriented characteristic that helps a person to achieve objectives and the initiative to undertake a task or activity without another’s nudging or supervision.Often, companies opt to motivate staff by financial benefits such as compensation and special incentives or non-financial benefits such as recognition or career development opportunities. The leader must possess the right leadership traits to influence motivation. Knowing the needs of individuals and the group immensely assists the leader to influence followers.An effective leader who steps into the shoes of the subordinate to view things from his or her angle and empathise with them, makes them strong and boosts their morale.Organisational leadership deals with the human mind and specialised strategy and the leader must have the potential to control the group of individuals. The leader should have the ability to guide a team without dominating them, by giving them a sense of direction.Organisational leadership is about processes, results and strategic communication that lead to an achievement. Personalities with high energy levels, self confidence and flexible qualities along with other leadership traits are recognised as good organisational leaders.Whatever said in theory, leaders are different to each other and do not possess the same attitude or perspective. Although it says that the carrot and stick method is ineffective in the modern world, both can be effective depending on the situation. Leadership styles differ with the individual personalities a leader interacts with and the specific situation.That may be why Steve Jobs, one of the most successful and respected business leaders said, “My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to take these great people we have and to push them and make them even better.’’"

30 May 2021,SLT-Mobitel will fulfill business objectives - CEO,"As 2021 dawned, two powerful telecommunications brands in Sri Lanka, SLT and Mobitel, came together in a brand unification as SLT-Mobitel, forming ‘The Connection’ that they promised will deliver all telecommunications and ICT products and services under one brand. Sunday Observer Business caught up with Chief Executive Officer of Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd Chandika Vitharana to find out more.Excerpts:Q:  How do you see brand unification helping boost business in the telecommunication sector and adding value to customers?A. As the National ICT and Telecommunications Service Provider, Sri Lanka Telecom has been in operation for over 160 years and the ‘go to’ brand in fixed telephony, and Mobitel being one of the largest mobile networks in the island,has played an integral role in transforming Sri Lanka with digitalization.By unifying the strengths of both fixed and mobile spheres, we have formed one mega brand ‘SLT-Mobitel’ bringing better services that will further empower people’s aspirations and fulfill business objectives with cutting edge connectivity solutions. Brand unification has also brought in robust synergy to combine the benefits of both SLT and Mobitel to offer innovative and diverse products and services that meet the requirements of our valued customers in terms of price, quality and value under one roof. With the SLT-Mobitel unification, customers can now leverage on the combined expertise and latest technology; to avail state-of-the-art products and services ranging from Voice connectivity, Fibre, IPTV, Home and Mobile Broadband, Enterprise Solutions, Mobile Money, Digital Health Services and a host of retail and corporate solutions.With the pledge to lead Sri Lanka towards an information and knowledge rich society, SLT-Mobitel’s unification theme “The Connection”, promises the end user a transformational experience through technological advancements. In other words, the connectivity needed for an SME is vastly different to a blue chip conglomerate, and with SLT-Mobitel, we are able to better identify the multi-faceted business requirements and provide tailor made products and services at an affordable price. Q: What special benefits will customers gain and how will it be worked out as one venture?A. The SLT-Mobitel unification unlocks doors for customers to access a range of products and services under one roof. The objective of the brand unification is to provide customers the entire ecosystem when it comes to connectivity. Be it a simple voice connection, home or mobile broadband, super-fast fibre connectivity, entertainment or enterprise solutions, customers receive complete connectivity solutions at an affordable price. With the unification, the company has obtained better market share as it enables us to cross sell and upsell products and services, providing Mobitel and SLT wider access to tap into the vast customer base of both organizations. As a unified brand, we believe that we are in a better position to offer total communication solutions for households and businesses covering the fixed and mobile category throughout the island. These cross functional solutions will be offered to customers at a lower cost point, as it comes from the same entity, providing the ideal win-all situation for consumers and the brand.Q:  What are your immediate and future plans to expand services and technology in the country?A. The global tech landscape is changing with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0), with more AI changing how we live, work, and most importantly, communicate. With data becoming the key driver of growth; IOT, AI, Big Data and other such elements will start playing a pivotal role in our lives becoming digitalised to the minutest detail. We have already started adapting to some of these ‘new ways’ and even more is on its way enhancing the way we shop, shaping a smart lifestyle and smart workplaces; creating a digital revolution for all Sri Lankans.It is in this new world that SLT-Mobitel will play a pivotal role, bringing future ready technology to our customers. For instance, the mobile arm of SLT-Mobitel has been heavily investing in digital infrastructure to improve connectivity across the country. In 2019 alone, SLT-Mobitel carried out the largest broadband expansion in the island, with an investment of over USD 100 million to improve 4G coverage across the island and has spent over USD 250 million to bolster overall broadband connectivity in Sri Lanka, since 2015.SLT-Mobitel is committed to facilitating the national goal of creating a digital Sri Lanka by supporting national level initiatives led by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) which aims to provide 100% 4G LTE connectivity solutions to rural communities.We have also started laying the groundwork for 5G technology which is fast becoming the game changer across the world. I must state that we were the first telecommunications service provider to trial 5G in South Asia and we have been recognised as the fastest mobile service network for 2019 and 2020. IWe also marked the first anniversary of trialing 5G for the first time in South Asia recently.  With the brand unification, SLT-Mobitel is on a transformational journey from being a mobile service provider to becoming a digital lifestyle enabler; offering cutting-edge connectivity solutions to individuals and enterprises and leading Sri Lanka towards the digital future."

1 August 2021, Giant freshwater prawn contributes to income enhancement of inland fishers,"Inland fisheries are crucial for many socially, economically and nutritionally vulnerable groups of people around the world. The increasing recognition of inland fisheries in development discourses has also encouraged research to enhance knowledge on the importance of inland fisheries.Increasing domestic demand for fish and fishery products in the countries of the southern hemisphere, such as Thailand, Indonesia and China that has been driven by the confluence of urbanisation, and rising incomes of people triggered by the international trade under the open economic policy, prompted concerns about food and nutritional security linked to fish and fishery products.Enviornmentaly friendly way of growing fishFisheries enhancement, which is defined as limited technological interventions in the life cycle of common pool fishery resources, and combines attributes of aquaculture (intervention in the life cycle of aquatic organisms) and capture fisheries (exploitation of common pool resources) in a unique way, is a strategy of achieving high fish yields per unit area of the habitat. Aquaculture-based fisheries or culture-based fisheries (CBF) is an environmentally friendly fisheries enhancement approach to increase fish yield per unit area.In CBF, the hatchery-reared juveniles are released to the natural habitats such as reservoirs, to recapture after a sufficient growth period. As these stocked juvenile fish or prawns feed on natural food sources available in the habitats, artificial feeding is not necessary, making this strategy an environmentally friendly venture.In Sri Lanka, CBF development in small village reservoirs, most of which are non-perennial and are not traditionally used for capture fisheries production, is essentially a rural development activity because at all stages of CBF including stocking, management of stocked fish, harvesting and marketing, active participation of rural people is in place. Due to initiatives of Government Fisheries Authorities and considerable scientific inputs, CBF development has been getting a momentum in Sri Lankan reservoirs.In 2003, as an initiative of the Aquatic Resource Development and Quality Improvement Project (ARDQIP) of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, medium sized (200-800 ha) and large (>800 ha) reservoirs of Sri Lanka were utilised for the development of CBF. Generally, Chinese and Indian major carps, common carp and Nile tilapia are stocked in reservoirs annually for CBF development.At presently, three giant freshwater prawn hatcheries of NAQDA produce over 50 million post larvae annually. This freshwater prawn (FWP) post larvae are also stocked indifferent kinds of reservoirs. In addition, a private sector aquaculture enterprise also operates a small-scale freshwater prawn hatchery and FWP post larvae produced in this hatchery are also stocked in selected reservoirs.Although freshwater prawns do not form a significant proportion of the culture based fisheries (CBF) production members of the rural fisheries organisations of several reservoirs have decided to stock post larvae of freshwater prawn in reservoirs, due to the reason that it is fetched at a higher price such as Rs. 300 - 1300 per kg compared to other finfish species groupsAccording to the NAQDA information sources it is targeted to harvest around 352000 mt of freshwater fish and aquaculture products in 2025 with fingerlings and prawns post larvae production increased up to 422 and 200 million.The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) has previously (1995-2003) supported two research projects for the management of reservoir fisheries and development of CBF in non-perennial reservoirs in Sri Lanka.In response to the recommendation of the 2016 ACIAR scoping study ‘Re-engagement in agricultural research for development partnerships in Sri Lanka’ a new project proposal was developed for ACIAR funding. This project duration will be four years that is July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2025 period.This has direct relevance to three key policies under the National Policy Framework: Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour. The three key policies relevant to this development plan are as per DW the cabinet decision,(i) People centric economic development(ii) Sustainable Environmental Management(iii) Technology based Society.Fresh water giant shrimps farming within Sri Lanka has been identified as a promising trade drawing a lucrative income with a higher potential to be developed and ensure benefits to the rural fisher folks’ community. It has been further identified appropriate to conduct scientific research since the young shrimps are not scientifically released to the fresh water resources.In this context, the Government has accepted a Cabinet resolution for implementing such a research project in conjunction with Wayamba, Ruhuna and Jaffna Universities, the NAQDA NARA and the Australia’s James Cook University as well as entering in to a research agreement among the applicable institutions. The project covers Trincomalee, Batticalo, Moneragala, Anuradhapura, Hambantota, Puttalam and Kurunegala Districts.The title of the project is ‘Improved productivity, efficiency and sustainability of the culture-based fishery for finfish and giant freshwater prawn in Sri Lankan reservoirs.’The project aims to introduce a robust, science-based management regime for the culture-based fishery of giant freshwater prawn and finfish species in Sri Lankan reservoirs, and improve facets of the supply chain that will ensure long term sustainability, improve productivity, profitability, livelihoods and incomes of local men and women, and impact positively on overall rural wellbeing.The objectives of the project are toInvestigate stocking, monitoring and harvesting practices, including development of biodynamic models, that optimise fish and giant fresh water prawns production, product quality and sustainability;Conduct an inclusive, complete market chain analysis from harvest to plate, to ensure post-harvest and supply practices meet market requirements and both male and female actors in the supply chain gain maximum benefits;Assess the economic performance of reservoir fisheries and identify changes in management practices that can increase their economic value for local communities; andDetermine opportunities and constraints to achieving socially equitable livelihood benefits from culture-based fisheries.Professor Upali Amarasinghe (Co-leader - Sri Lanka) attached to the Department of Zoology and Environmental Management of Kelaniya University said referring to the project. That the project would be led by James Cook University (JCU), Australia in collaboration with the National Aquaculture Development Authority of Sri Lanka (NAQDA), Wayamba University of Sri Lanka (WUSL) and University of Ruhuna (UoR). NAQDA is the primary governmental agency responsible for development of aquaculture and inland fisheries and related policy development and execution.The Sri Lankan universities are selected for the availability of expertise in fisheries and aquaculture, and previous experiences in collaborative research funded by foreign donor agencies including ACIAR in the subject area.10 district namely Monaragala, Anuradhapura, Mullaithivu, Hambantota, Killinochchi are used to implement the project.Fish production from the reservoirs is predominantly consumed by the local communities, providing a significant proportion of protein requirements.In addition to a variety of finfish species, giant freshwater prawn has become part of the stocking for CBF in recent years. The harvests of giant freshwater prawn are not used for local consumption but are sold to high-end restaurants and hotels in Sri Lanka or are exported. Their value is about eight times higher per kilogram than the finfish species, i.e. approximately Rs1300 per kilogram as compared with Rs 150 per kilogram for the finfish species.The project will provide mechanisms to increase fish and prawn production in currently stocked reservoirs, and also extend CBF to additional reservoirs, thus contributing to livelihoods, poverty alleviation and food security in reservoir communities, professor Amarasinghe explained further.Giant freshwater prawns are a high valued fishery product, in great demand in Asia and particularly in Thailand and China. Over the past 10 years, world GFP production, primarily from aquaculture rather than CBF has fallen, while demand has increased. Although the combined aquaculture production of GFP from China, Bangladesh, Thailand and India has exceeded 200,000 tonnes, this has fallen in the past five years due to issues with post-larval supply and other factors.Sri Lankan CBF-produced GFPs have unique characteristics; they are mostly live product rather than frozen, are of large size (300g as compared with 200g from aquaculture), and are considered as organic because of the natural production, all of which provide a premium in price. Prospects for increasing price paid for Sri Lankan GFP, while production is increased through improved CBF practices arising from this project, are strong. By studying the supply chain from reservoir to consumer, the project will seek to maximise the value of the product and improve the return to the fishers.The culture-based fisheries of Sri Lanka provide two primary benefits, firstly, the fish production contributes to food security, providing much needed protein for the local communities adjacent to the reservoirs and nearby, secondly, the giant freshwater prawn production provides substantial income, which may contribute significantly to livelihoods, poverty reduction and provide a stimulus to the local economy.Enhancing giant fresh water prawn productionAccording to Prof. Amarasinghe the core issue to be addressed in the proposed research is the enhancement of the giant freshwater prawn production, within the context of improving the management, livelihood and food security outcomes of the entire fishery comprising finish and GFP.Increased production of GFP alone will have the greatest benefit and impact due to its high value, and this will be pursued within strategies to increase reservoir fishery production overall (fish and prawns).There are currently approximately 675 reservoirs stocked with GFP under the auspices of NAQDA, representing some 2500 fisher families. Through preliminary studies, it is envisaged that enhancement of the existing prawn stocked reservoirs and addition of new reservoirs, could benefit more than 10,000 families directly, and many more indirectly.NAQDA’s role in the project is comprehensive as it will be involved in all aspects of the research and communication of results. NAQDA will provide the interface between research findings and recommendations for revised stocking strategies and CBF management, and the reservoir communities, through their respective Fisheries Societies.The NAQDA extension staff will operate side by side with project researchers to facilitate the surveys for supply chain, economics and social science investigations. NAQDA will provide the giant freshwater prawn post-larvae for research purposes, and their staff (hatchery staff and extension officers) will work alongside the University researchers for the reservoir research activities.NAQDA will be responsible for communicating CBF policy recommendations, arising from the project, to the Government of Sri Lanka.Applyin culture based fishery practicesDr. K.B.C. ,a team leader representing NAQDA attached to the study program told to Sunday Observer that the productivity of the fisheries resources of Sri Lankan reservoirs has been improved through application of culture-based fishery (CBF) practices.The term culture based fishery refers to communally managed production of juveniles that is prawn post larvae and finish fry. through aquaculture practices and the stocking of those juveniles into reservoir, to create or enhance a fishery for those species.In addition to a variety of finish that serve to provide protein to rural island communities adjacent to reservoirs, the addition of stoked giant freshwater prawn (GFP) has added significant value due to high market price 10 times higher than that of finfish. Currently the GFP are captured as a by catch to finfish and the stocking practices are ad-hoc, resulting in very low yield per seed prawn stocked.This fishery is managed as a single multi- species fishery and although the project will focus on research of GFP, some aspects of the research will involve the entire fishery particularly modelling of stocking and yields.This will provide benefits for production of all species with an emphasis on enhancement of GFP production through specific research of stocking practices, production dynamics, interactive affects among stocked and naturally recruited species, harvest and socio - economic aspects of the fishery and the supply chain.It should be noted that all products such as fish and prawns arising from CBF have a better reputation for consumers than equivalent products from traditional aquaculture. The project aims to introduce a robust science- based management regime for the culture based fishery of macro.macro brachium resenbergil (giant fresh water prawn) finish species in Sri Lanka reservoirs and improve facets of the supply chain that will ensure long term sustainability, improve productivity profitability, livelihoods and incomes of local men and women and impact positively on overall rural wellbeing, Dr Pushpalatha emphasised.She said that NAQDA has three fresh water prawn breeding centres at Kahawamodara in Hambanthota district Pambala in Puttlam and Kallavawa in Trincomalee District to produce post larvae of fresh water prawns. Wayamba and Ruhuna Universities have proven capacity in fisheries, biology, resource management and socio-economic disciplines. Both have collaborated in previous internationally funded projects (including ACIAR) in the subject area.There will be further capacity building in these two universities through involvement in the project and the contributions from high calibre scientists from both Sri Lanka and Australia, engaged by the project.Individual capacity building will be a particular focus, with planned post-graduate study programs for at least five young scientists who will be employed as research assistants by the project. The project will inform strategies that are likely to lead to changes in reservoir communities’ knowledge, attitudes, assets, skills, and equity, and, hence, their adoption of best practices for culture-based fisheries. Increased adoption and best practices are likely to lead to improvements in stocking, management, harvesting, and marketing, leading to increases in the production and quality of reservoir finfish and GFP.The inclusive market chain analysis is likely to identify new domestic and export market opportunities, as well as constraints within current supply chains and opportunities for improving these chains for the men and women involved.The social science research will inform strategies to ensure men and women in the reservoir communities are empowered to meet their livelihood goals through engaging with CBF, and that other outcomes of the project are equitably distributed and accessible.The social science research will also contribute to developing management and capacity building strategies that align with and enhance existing governance and management structures to maximise sustainable ecological, social, and economic outcomes of CBF.After careful implementation of the research findings, these opportunities will provide significant livelihood and employment opportunities for women and men in local fishery communities.The project has a significant focus on strengthening inclusive capacity of project partners. All in all, the project findings will place inland fisheries management on a firmer footing ensuring sustainability and improved livelihood opportunities for the country’s fishery community in rural areas.Also, the findings will supplement previous findings from ACIAR-funded CBF projects in the Asian region, thereby contributing to inclusive guidelines for effective implementation of culture-based fisheries in lacustrine waters in the region.This will enhance fish production and contribute to inclusive poverty alleviation in rural communities through engagement in fisheries activities. Indeed, the overall increase in inland fisheries production through adoption of culture-based fisheries in lakes and reservoirs will supplement fish production from aquaculture development in the region.Culture-based fisheriesCulture-based fisheries in reservoirs are environmentally benign, will be sustainable in the long term and will generate inclusive benefits for the whole region. The results can be extended into other continents such as Africa which has lagged behind in fish production and effective utilisation of available inland waters for fish production and improvement of rural nutrition.The fisheries management committees will be encouraged to maintain transparency and hold annual meetings of the membership where members of the research team will be invited and healthy dialogue among all members encouraged; as far as possible efforts will be made to minimise political interference and particularly so in respect of stocking strategies which should be conducted based on viable scientific information only.As the project proceeds and the understanding of management strategies become apparent, the researchers will continue to apprise the fishery societies of the relevant findings and developments at their monthly meetings; these interactions will also provide the opportunity to receive feedback on the potential changes and accordingly fine tune the management strategies that are to be put in place.The exit strategy will also include provision to the NAQDA of a protocol for determining the suitability of reservoirs for adoption of Culture Based Fisheries (CBF) in each of the districts. This outcome will become the policy of NAQDA, and suitable, easily comprehensible information fact sheets will be prepared for distribution to the reservoir fisheries societies."
6 September 2020,Core benefits of customer relations,"Customer relations is an important paradigm in business that promotes customer satisfaction and loyalty. The process fundamentally involves managing communication, resolving issues and complaints amicably, and building lasting relationships with clients.Relationships are important for repeat buying, references, and recommendations from customers which provide essential assistance in the long run to a business entity. Most companies dedicate and focus on relationship management to build a strong reputation in the market as a customer-oriented business entity.The actual and most important purpose of customer relationship management is to strengthen customer loyalty.A customer may be satisfied with the service provided by the company without being loyal. Therefore, the organisation must distinguish loyalty from satisfaction clearly. Loyalty brings the customer again to the company without buying from the competitor.An important factor is that it is always easier to keep existing customers than finding new ones. Besides, it is easier to cross-sell and increase revenue when the company has a loyal customer base.The cost of attracting a new customer can also be several folds higher than bringing back existing patrons.  Repeat customers are more likely to recommend the company to others and the effectiveness in such an act is tremendous.  In the prevailing modern trade scenario, companies use various strategies to build strong relationships. While the most vital action in building a relationship is the first interaction with a customer whether it is physical or digital, companies concentrate on providing training to the frontline staff for this purpose. In any business situation, from the time of the doorman’s greeting, until the customer leaves the premises, the entire staff that meets him must be comprehensively aware of the importance of relationship building.    However, there are other important tools available for an organisation to engage customers. Using feedback forms, training of staff on handling disputes or other issues, responding to customers directly, and developing and encouraging a service culture are some of them.  The creation of customer loyalty points, which are widely practiced by many large organisations in Sri Lanka is an effective tactic.This practice can be introduced to any organisation irrespective of size. Offering discounts and free-product coupons, competitions, and extended warranties are some other forms of strategies by established companies with significant impact.Experts have recently found that a customer abandons a product or a company due to poor customer relations. Therefore, proper attention must be paid to enhance service to build a lasting connection. In a competitive market, a strong personal relationship can be the difference between the successes of the organisation and the competitors. If your competitor provides a better and friendlier service, the customers, most likely, will leave and take their money to your competitor. Hence, in this fiercely competitive market, companies must take the departure of even a single customer seriously.  If you neglect this move, customers will switch ships. A sound relationship gives an assurance of a customer’s return and repeat sales due to the loyalty created. A happy customer will come back for more purchases whereas an unhappy customer will seek assistance from elsewhere for his needs. Good rapport with incoming customers can help the organisation by way of new connections.More connections in the pipeline will make it easier to communicate about your products or services. More connections and relationships can also help increase word of mouth communication by clients who keep on recommending your products to others. This is a very successful model of effective advertising.However, on the other hand, one must realise that usually, people are also good at spreading bad news if they are unhappy about a product. This can be serious and lead to market rejection if not handled with caution. A single person can cause grave damage to the reputation of a product or a company through bad and negative comments. This is the reason for many marketing organisations to carry out customer satisfaction surveys to ascertain the level of customer’s actual response. The information from these surveys can be immensely helpful to raise the level of service.    A good relationship and the trust established can increase sales not only from repetition but also from cross-sales.A customer coming to purchase a specific product may be encouraged to purchase a different item with the loyalty created through the relationship.When your staff is consistent in maintaining a honest and friendly attitude while selling a product or delivering a service, the customer is certain to come again. In an aggressively competitive and unpredictable market such as in Sri Lanka, providing the best possible service will result in a secure customer base.  It also will strengthen the brand of the organisation.Companies must take the maximum effort to exceed the service expectations as the relationships are one of the most important factors in the success of an organisation engaged in any business. Customers always look for proactive service that creates a good impression of the organisation.Real-time assistance, by way of personal involvement or online live chat, is a key factor in providing a good experience to the customer.   The company can obtain feedback information to understand the customer’s needs better and provides an opportunity to deliver a great service experience through this. Everybody, by their own experience, knows that customer happiness and satisfaction are important to an organisation. Therefore, interacting with the customer on a personal level is immensely important  to establish a trustworthy inter-connection. Personalisation can increase loyalty which provides a high conversion rate.Nevertheless, personal involvement with a customer must be done cautiously as the personalities differ. The staff must be trained to match their tone with the customer’s personality.The factor to understand is that some customers prefer long conversations while others like briefings. Recognising customer preferences to understand their needs is essential. Integration of customer service etiquette is vital for an organisation to extend an exceptional service.The staff must be trained adequately to interact with customers. They must be convinced to genuinely engage customers by always using positive words or phrases, active listening, to offer gratitude and show empathy. Today, companies use Customer Relationship Management (CRM) management tools to optimise revenue and profits and enhance customer satisfaction.CRM software enables companies to streamline customer communication. By using these software programs, companies can easily segment clients in a better way for augmented revenue, retention, and faster communication.Making the customer feel special can be a huge impact on a company’s name. Hence, going the extra mile to deliver and exceed customer expectations is imperative. To improve the brand, the organisation has to offer reasons to customers to emotionally connect. "

This was in recognition of the Bank’s success during the past financial years.Surpassing its position in the Top 30 from number 27 in 2017 to number 18 in 2018 to number 9 in 2019, NDB was recognised for the bank’s stable performance, steady organic growth, competitive strengths, innovative banking solutions and sustainability initiatives.Business Today Top 30 2018-2019 indicates the manner in which the banking and financial sector has performed even through challenging times. They have streamlined their strategies and processes to ensure that while the organisation performs the customers to benefit.NDB Group CEO Dimantha Seneviratne said, “As we move into the new decade we believe that digital convenience is the way forward. Digitisation of our customer touch points, such as the neos app and phygital branches has not impacted the rapid progress we have had in deploying robotics and workflow systems in the support functions. This will improve efficiencies and also give us the agility to lead the transformation that digitisation will bring, not only in the banking industry, but the country as a whole.“The credit of this esteemed achievement should go to my leadership team, who are here today, for leading the transformation of the bank to the force it is; the staff, for their unstinted loyalty and hard work; my board of directors, for their guidance, wisdom and strategic directions,” he said."
10 May 2021,SEC to showcase Lanka as a destination for foreign portfolio investments,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has performed exceptionally well in the past 12 months with the All Share Price Index (ASPI) appreciating over 55% and the S&P SL 20 Index appreciating over 44%. In 2021, the Average Daily Turnover of the CSE stands at Rs 4.8 bn as against Rs. 1.8 bn in 2020.Even though the market has performed exceptionally well, foreign investor contribution to the total market turnover is not substantial due to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic throughout the world. Efforts will be made to impress upon foreign investors and fund managers and the diaspora, of the compelling value proposition of the Sri Lankan Capital Market. The SEC believes capital flows will also act as a catalyst for economic growth and contribute towards increased wealth creation.As an initial step, the SEC along with the Foreign Ministry and the CSE has commenced a series of virtual meetings to educate staff of Sri Lankan Missions overseas on the growth potential and investment opportunities available in the Capital Market of Sri Lanka. This initiative will enable the staff  to promote portfolio investments to Sri Lanka among the investor community in the respective countries and assist the SEC and the CSE in organising future overseas forums.“Portfolio investment will act as a catalyst for economic growth and is a top priority for the Government, particularly in the context of post-Covid economic recovery. These forums will offer the Sri Lankan diaspora the opportunity to understand the investment prospects available in the capital market of Sri Lanka as well” remarked VirajDayaratne PC, Chairman SEC.The first in the series was conducted with the participation of Minister (Commercial) Dr. Lakmini Mendis and senior officials of the High Commission of Sri Lanka in United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland., High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in Singapore, Ms. Sashikala Premawardhane, Ambassador of Sri Lanka in Sweden, Dharshana M. Perera and Ambassador of Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, Malraj de Silva, Consul General of Sri Lanka Dubai and Northern Emirates, Nalinda Wijerathna, Head of Chancery, Embassy of Sri Lanka Abu Dhabi, M.I.M. Rizvi and senior officials from the Foreign Ministry also participated in the virtual forums conducted with the respective Foreign Missions.The SEC and the Foreign Ministry are in the process of organising three more virtual presentations with the assistance of Sri Lanka Missions in Tokyo, Washington and Beijing. Additional Secretary Foreign Ministry, P. M. Amza, the Chairman SEC Viraj Dayaratne, Director General SEC Chinthaka Mendis, CEO CSE Rajeeva Bandaranaike, Director, External Relations and Capital Market Education, SEC, Thushara Jayaratne, Director Surveillance and Capital Market Development, SEC, Prabash Wanigatunge, Head of Marketing, CSE, Niroshan Wijesundere, Head of Research and Strategy, CSE, Nishantha Hewavithana and senior officials of the SEC and CSE participated in these initial virtual forums."
24 May 2020,  Handling labour migration in Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka, which has been sending workers abroad for employment for decades, is now faced with the formidable challenge of repatriating large numbers of migrant workers affected by Covid-19. Having brought back students from China, UK, Australia, and South Asia and pilgrims from India, the authorities are now making plans to repatriate large numbers of migrant workers.But, unlike bringing home students and pilgrims, this upcoming repatriation exercise involving migrant workers calls for a continued coordination with the returnees, beyond the period of travel and quarantine.Need to repatriateThe pandemic resulted in Sri Lankan origin migrant workers returning to the country in large numbers, during the first half of March 2020. The influx of returnees up to mid–March comprised mainly workers in South Korea, Italy, and other European countries.But, with the closure of Sri Lanka’a air and sea ports for arrivals on March 19, many were unable to return. As of mid-May, the number of migrant workers waiting to return to Sri Lanka has further increased. This includes those without jobs in their countries of destination, possibly due to being laid off as a result of the economic downturn caused by the pandemic and those who have ended their employment contract and were due to return anyway.It includes migrant workers still holding a job but are underemployed or fear becoming unemployed in the near future, and those who are willing to give up a secure job to safeguard themselves from the raging pandemic.Latest estimates show that around 17,000 migrant workers and their families are trying to return to Sri Lanka, and the government has planned out a meticulous scheme to repatriate them. This involves prioritising those hoping to return based on the countries of destination, and within countries, prioritising based on the type and the situation of these migrant workers. For instance, repatriation from Kuwait will be fast-tracked to make use of the amnesty granted to those without valid entry documents.At the same time, the government is nudging migrants who are still holding a job to reassess their situation in their countries of destination and consider their plight in Sri Lanka once returned.Halted departuresEven though most migrant workers who are planning to return are still outside the Sri Lankan labour market, the domestic labour market is already affected by the stock of ‘would-have-been’ migrant workers. Specifically, compared to the approximately 15,000 Sri Lankans who left for foreign employment in April 2019, in April 2020, there were zero departures of migrant workers,  the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign employment (SLBFE) temporarily banned the departure of migrant workers registered with them.May 2020 also appears to be a lost month in terms of foreign employment, while in March 2020, only about a half of the planned departures occurred (around 7,500). As such, from mid-March to end of May, the missed foreign employment opportunities for Sri Lankans amount to around 37,500 jobs. All these ‘would-have-been’ migrant workers add to the displacement in the Sri Lankan labour market, as they are unemployed for all intents and purposes.Domestic labour marketRegardless of the returning migrant workers and those who could not take up their planned foreign jobs, the labour market in Sri Lanka has been feeling the impact of Covid-19 in many ways. For instance, hundreds of thousands of informal sector workers immediately became unemployed or underemployed with the economic shutdown on March 20. Now, private sector employees are hit by the unemployment/underemployment wave. In short, even without factoring in the returning and the ‘would-have–been’ migrant workers, the Sri Lankan labour market was already in turmoil from Covid-19.Way forwardWith a growing unemployment rate, Sri Lanka should rapidly start programs to address the unfavourable repercussions of the pandemic on the labour market. In doing so, special strategies should be developed to handle unemployment associated with migrant workers. As such, just as the government has invested time and resources to carefully plan a large scale repatriation exercise of migrant workers, it has to be complemented with a detailed plan to address the resulting labour market challenges. ‘Would-have-been’ migrant workers1. Ensure they retain their skills and training until they can be redeployed.i. SLBFE to provide online programs or short videos to help them maintain their skills and training.2. Redirect them towards reskilling and upskilling activities and provide appropriate certifications.3. Contact their ‘would-have-been’ employers and find out about the availability of the same employment opportunity.•  If the above employment opportunity is still available, plan out a rapid deployment plan, without losing this opportunity to another sending country.•  If the above employment opportunity is no longer available, explore the possibility of negotiating a new employment package (wages, benefits, etc.) with more flexibility to facilitate the employer to hire the same ‘would-have-been’ migrant worker.Returning migrant workers1. Ensure that returning migrant workers have received their service letters and other such credentials, as well as payments and benefits.2. Provide Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) certification.3. Deploy them, as appropriate, towards skills development of those unemployed in Sri Lanka.4. Assist their socio economic reintegration.Migration sector1. Lift the SLBFE’s current temporary ban on departure for foreign employment for all countries, as this restriction only applies to those registered with SLBFE, and the continuation of the ban further deepens the dichotomy among registered and unregistered migrant workers.i. Instead impose the ban on a list of selected countries, with selection to be done on a scientific/medical basis.2. Maintain regular contact with employers of returning migrant workers, and overseas recruitment agencies through:•  Sri Lankan diplomatic missions.   i. Recruitment agencies in Sri Lanka.3. Explore possible measures to encourage overseas employers to retain Sri Lankan migrant workers.• Alternative working arrangements, telecommuting.4. Introduce an attractive, streamlined, flexible and speedy mechanism for overseas employers to rehire laid off Sri Lankan workers as well as to hire new employees. •  Provide additional flexibility for employers who have previously employed Sri Lankan workers.Bilesha Weeraratne is a Research Fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka."
15 November 2020,Govt confident of implementing Budget proposals – State Minister Ajith Nivard Cabraal,"State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms Ajith Nivard Cabraal said he is confident that the expertise and the commitment of the President, Prime Minister, Cabinet of Ministers and other Government officials, will enable us to achieve what has been set out in the Budget. The State Minister in an interview with the Sunday Observer said they are keen to ensure that the Budget is implemented fully and that all that has been set out are achieved. We are confident that the Budget implementation will actually be quite robust so that we will derive the benefits envisaged.State Minister Cabraal said overall we can be reasonably pleased that Sri Lanka has come out well in the Covid-19 as well as the economic management, which are important for a country like ours.He said we are back on the recovery path and many people from the world over are remitting money to Sri Lanka. There is a 36 per cent increase in the remittances last month alone which shows a clear improvement in the rural and the industrial base. The State Minister is optimistic that the economic growth will not suffer as much as what other countries have had suffer.Q: Since there is a global pandemic what is the outlook for the Budget?A: We have some clear strategies and goals and wish to implement them as fast as possible. While implementing those strategies to achieve the goals, there may be a few adjustments that we need to make on a temporary basis to deal with the Covid-19 situation.But our overall goals have not changed, and we will be pursuing them notwithstanding the Covid-19 pandemic. That is the way we will approach it.Q: Does the Government offer new incentives to boost the export market?A: We have already done the most important thing. We have maintained the rupee at a favourable level. We have brought down interest rates to manageable numbers. We have improved port facilities as well as port activities. We have brought in some innovation as well as automation at the Customs.All those facilities that support the overall export industry have been undertaken. At the same time, we are ensuring the logistical arrangements to bring cargo in and to take cargo out. They have been improved in the Customs and the Ports. Therefore, we are confident that the export sector will do well thereby improving economic growth.Q: The local manufacturers are reeling under the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Has the Government launched a ‘bailout’ package?A: We have already given the local industrialists a debt moratorium which we have worked out through the banks. We have given them a tax reduction. Almost all the sectors in the country have been given a tax reduction, and we have given an interest rate reduction. These are the things that the people have been asking for. Of course, there has been some closure to certain periods.That is actually a temporary phenomenon. Other than tourism which has faced some setbacks, all the other industries are bouncing back. If you study some of the companies listed in the Stock Exchange almost all of them have shown very good results in the third quarter, and the fourth quarter is also showing some improved results.Hence, I think we are very well back on the recovery path and many people from all over the world are remitting money to Sri Lanka. The remittances have improved quite significantly.About 36 percent improvement in the remittances in the last month alone shows that the rural base as well as the industrial base has been improving on a basis that has been fairly clear. So I am optimistic that the economic growth will not suffer as much as what other countries have had to face.Q: The Central Bank appears to have deviated from the traditional role and begun to introduce aid packages to the affected businessmen. Could you elaborate on this?A: The Central Bank also has to be flexible to ensure that the economic growth as well as the transition of funds in the entire system is improved. In a situation where there is some disturbance, interruption or difficulty, the Central Bank must come to the forefront to provide support.This is nothing unusual because if you remember the time when I was the Central Bank Governor we carried out many innovations to ensure that business continues to operate and move. This is the right attitude to take and we are doing that. Interest rates have been kept low to stimulate the economy and I believe we are on the right track to provide those facilities to industrialists.The Central Bank has been guaranteeing certain loans with the reimbursement of certain funds that have been transmitted by the banks. These are important to maintain growth at reasonable levels. I believe in the next few weeks and months, we will continue to see results and we will hopefully get over this situation with less pain than we originally thought we would have to suffer.Q: Is the Budget going to be development oriented and if so what are its priorities?A: Several priorities will be identified in the Budget. One is the water based project. We wish to ensure that the people in the country enjoy pipe borne water in the future. As we know about 42 or 43 per cent of the people have pipe borne water, and we want it to reach at least 95 per cent of the population.If you remember, during the tenure of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the country had only 70 per cent coverage in electricity but the Government was able to increase electricity coverage up to 99 per cent.Similarly, water will be a priority for this Government. We will also be looking at 100,000 kilometres of road projects which again will have a lot of support from the Government.The Government will also address the human- elephant conflict to ensure that the people in about 14 districts who are suffering from that conflict will be given support. Sometimes the elephants attack human beings and human beings attack the elephants.Due to this conflict we see a lot of economic activity being stalled. Children are unable to go to schools and people have to stop work and leave for their homes by 5 pm. Such issues crop up because of the human-elephant conflict. So we need to address this matter as well.Also, we have to encourage Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) to the country. We are arranging new pockets of sources to which the FDIs should flow in. One is the Port City.The second is port related activities and the third, the farmer industry where we have already allocated 400 acres of lands. We are also promoting the improvement of educational and health facilities.Hence, there are vast numbers of new ventures that will be promoted to ensure that the people will make these investments. It will be an investment driven budget. At the same time, the Government has about 289 projects which are presently ongoing, each over billions of rupees.It is another area where we would concentrate to ensure that those projects are completed as fast as possible to ensure that the growth momentum is maintained. These are all avenues open to the Government and the country which we will promote. We also wish to ensure that the macro fundamentals remain stable.That is, the rupee to be stable and interest rates to be stable at lower rates. We have to ensure that the reserves build up. We want to see that unemployment is kept in check. All these will be helpful to take the country forward in the next five years.Q: Instead of going for a total lockdown, the Government has resumed business activities while controlling the Covid-19. Could you explain the new system?A: I think that is what is important. When you lock down a country or a vast geographical area, you find that the economic factors suffer immensely. Many countries are beginning to understand this and are moving to a situation where it is a partial lockdown for a limited period of time of limited areas which have concentrations of Covid-19.Sri Lanka is following that. I think it is an excellent way to deal with this situation because we have to have a reasonable balance between the management of Covid-19 from the perspective of health conditions while ensuring that the people have the space and the ability to continue with their economic activities and their livelihood. It is maintaining a delicate balance as instructed by the Government.We have to ensure that health regulations and health conditions are adhered to while at the same time allowing people to do their businesses, attend to their employment and continue with their economic activities. That is important for the country to move forward and also have the resources to fight this disease.Q: Is there any truth in the Opposition allegation that the Government has not properly handled the second wave of Covid-19?A: It is natural for the Opposition to make such allegations. Actually, if the Opposition was in Government, there would not have been a second wave of Covid-19 because the first wave would have probably finished us all off.They are now talking about a second wave. Had they been in office we would have been in a real mess because we know how badly they have been handling other issues, let alone Covid-19 which is of a huge magnitude. However, we have maintained a delicate balance between the two.We have dealt with the Covid-19 situation and at the same time ensured that the economy also moves. So that a balance has been struck carefully and the Government is moving forward. We have got a few more patients than we had in the past.But the number of people who are recovering and discharged from hospitals are also increasing rapidly. Unfortunately, we have had some deaths which we had to face. However, those numbers are much less in terms of the percentage that some affluent countries have had to suffer. I think the health authorities have done an excellent job. The support staff of the Security Forces and the Police have also done their duty in the tracing of Covid-19 suspected patients and treating them. The quarantine system too has worked very well. Most of the patients were those who came from abroad.Therefore, we can see the community spread that the Opposition is talking about is not as widespread as what they had been making out. I think overall we can be reasonably pleased that Sri Lanka has come out well in this Covid-19 management as well as economic management both of which are important for the country.Q: Are there any special measures in place to protect the garment industry and ensure its smooth functioning as a major foreign exchange earner?A: All industries have been given the space to continue with their activities. Not only the industries, but the agriculture and services sector too have been provided with the space to develop their own methods to be able to continue with their businesses.So working from home, working with the proper protective gear, making sure that meetings are held in an atmosphere where the transmission is limited are all carefully handled by the Government and guidelines have been issued to ensure that the spread of the Coronavirus is controlled as much as possible. We have to appreciate the fact that the results have been comparatively good and it is an indication of the way that the Government has handled this situation.Q: A Budget is a development initiative. Will the current global economic stagnation have its constraints on the Budget implementation?A: There would always be challenges. But the implementation of the Budget is mainly a function of the commitment that we have to ensure that the Budget is implemented. Someone has to follow up.That is the important part of the philosophy of implementing any Budget or for that matter any action. I think we are working well in the management techniques. We have been in the forefront of many challenging tasks in the past. I am confident that with the expertise and the commitment of the President, the Prime Minister, the Cabinet of Ministers and other Government officials, we will be able to achieve what has been set out in the Budget. We are keen to ensure that the Budget is implemented well and that all that has been set out are achieved.One of the functions of my Ministry is project monitoring. As I said before, we have about 289 projects in progress. We will be following those projects carefully to ensure that they are implemented on time. We have already started working on these projects. We are confident that the Budget implementation will be robust and the people will derive the benefits that are envisaged."

13 September 2020,“Organisations with fair policies face the least disruption”,"Organisations need proper governance and concern for people who serve them whether they have a profit orientation or not, said Former Director General of the Employers’ Federation of Ceylon (EFC) and legal luminary Franklyn Amerasinghe at the launch of his book ‘Business Oriented People Management’ at the EFC last week.Excerpts of the speech:“The common perception is that business management is about profits and people are only a means to an end - the end being profit.“My theme was to place People Managers within an organisational frame which is all the while grappling with a multitude of factors some of which are beyond the control of the enterprise and dictated by social and political forces.“By acquiring awareness of factors which influence stakeholders, Human Resource Managers could make a more significant contribution to their organisations, and also benefit by better recognition of their own roles by demonstrating their ability to think holistically.“The professionalism of a People Manager comes from an ability to understand the organisation and its people as completely as humanly possible.“I have had a working life of over fifty years. I learnt industrial relations, and learnt to deal with its many social ramifications, from the master, Sriyan de Silva, to whom the book is dedicated.“Governance and handling people I learnt by my participation in Boards in the public and private sector, and of course by managing the Federation and its services.“People at work need to identify their accountability to the community and having socially well-adjusted employees is another key aspect of the People Manager’s role. Overall sustainability is a people-driven activity.“People need to be the same whether they are at home or at the workplace. The pandemic and the locus of employment being shunted back and forth between the traditional workplace and the home, may have caused confusion in the lives of some.“The history of managing people in Sri Lanka is attempted in the first chapter. Organisations react to situations rather than anticipate events.“The EFC, for example, was formed as a reaction to the first national trade union of Goonesinghe. Managing people was reactive and based on dispute prevention and mitigation of damage through agreed processes.“Companies sought refuge either under the labour laws or collective agreements, to ensure that they could do their business without interruption.One thing was always clear, the least disrupted organisations were those which had clear, transparent and fair policies.“The Open Economy challenged management to be productive and efficient for their survival or growth. From the 1980s, sector wide bargaining was progressively dismantled and employers grasped the opportunity to introduce the carrot of personal incentives, and other individual carrots, which would make the employee think of his or her individual interests.“HR Development seemed directly proportional to what the organisation wanted to extract from the employee and by and large paid scant attention to what the employee himself or herself wanted. “When the markets are buoyant, when career paths can be opened, profits flow steadily, and there is largesse to distribute. History shows us that cyclical changes are inevitable in consumer markets, but our organisations are never ready for adverse situations. Employees are then seen as a burden, aggravated by the rigidity of local laws.Bad times“Organisations need to think of the ever present risk of bad times and cushion themselves against it. Decision makers in a company have paid little attention to accepting the value of Human Resource Services for anticipating and planning for the risks which beset them.“The CEO has the primary responsibility for performance, and motivating employees to perform, by ensuring that they are treated fairly, equally and with empathy. He or she, in turn must see that the code which he lives by is adopted by all with People Management responsibilities.“The HR Service would be a team of Managers and Executives who form a core service of communicating policy, setting and administering processes, managing issues and settling them amicably, coaching and mentoring those responsible for teams, encouraging the aspirations of employees and planning their development.The bond between the CEO, sector managers, line managers and the HR services is a vital one.“Governance issues are as distant from the realm of HR Services as could possibly be, right now.This needs to change so that the HR function is an integrated strategic function. The organisation has apart from the need to be responsible to shareholders, an overarching responsibility to a multitude of stakeholders. This includes the employees and their families, groups to which they belong whether religious or social, the community within which one does business, the political groups, consumers and value chains to name some obvious groups.Dialogue“The policy makers of a company need to have a dialogue with employees on an ongoing basis, and this can be best achieved by an HR Service which could be a channel for two-way communication.“The need for a proper system of dialogue is strongly advocated by the book. But for such a dialogue to be possible, the HR function must have adequate competence to know what the issues for top management are, and what information should be communicated to it to ensure that decisions are people sensitive.“HR people nowadays know little about Industrial Relations which many ignore at their peril. The current global situation has brought the focus again on collective interests rather than individual interests of employees, which latter area is what most HR people have been tutored in.I have given an overview of the significant laws and of collective bargaining as these are essential to understand legal compliance and the implications of collective thinking. ILO Conventions, concerns of the WTO, International Unions, and Ethical Investors are useful to create a global context for employment.“We live in an era of specialisation, and technical people who direct the work of people, fail to see that employment has social and economic consequences far beyond the work unit.Survival“The Novel Coronavirus has resulted in businesses being challenged to create novel methods of survival. The clock was an essential tool of managing work, and in the past, employers thought that discipline started with employees being made to adhere to a norm of eight solid hours, or more if needed, under their watchful eyes.“A paradigm shift in favour of work which is self-managed, casts obligations on both sides to be responsible. There has to be a culture change to be flexible and creative, in eliciting performance from a virtual workplace.“There is also no special credit for talent acquired or retained.In short, people are not valued as a resource.“The failure to have processes which help everyone in the organisation to have access to information I think is responsible for much of the pain.“Social Responsibility is not only for good times but is a continuing responsibility. Laws are of no consequence as they are meant to be applied when conditions are normal. This is why Courts of Equity were born.“The current situation demands common sense solutions which are flexible, fluid but responsible in terms of sharing the pain equitably. The history of the world has revealed that desperation caused by inequality is the seed for revolution. "

19 September 2021,Entrepreneurship - surviving Covid-19,"One of the hard-hit sectors of the pandemic is the informal sector. Entrepreneurs of various businesses find it hard to operate with minimum resources due to constant restrictions.

We were already a lean organization with industry experts.Q: How did you restructure the business?A: We did not restructure. We were using the tools we had in place one year ago which brings joy to any technopreneur. Our payment gateway is used the international clients who are facing lockdowns this makes us a forward-thinking Sri Lankan agency.The automation tool is attracting other international agencies to work with us, as it’s simple, cost-effective and efficient.Q: What was one thing impossible to do during the lockdowns?A: Network.Q: How has your industry been affected?A: Promotional budgets cut by companies, newspapers reducing the number of pages resulting in the lack of space for business news and slow decision making.Q: What new thing did you do concerning your business?A: Attention to sustainability - News Publisher is growing a tree for every client.We will have our little forest. We also help selected entrepreneurs with their marketing plans, share knowledge on tech incorporation into business and publicity.****Financial aspect of the business is challenging for entrepreneursAlanki Kishani Perera - Founder, Radha, actress and talk show hostQ: As a young entrepreneur, how has it been dealing with Covid-19?A: Dealing with the pandemic has been challenging for many entrepreneurs in terms of the financial aspect of the business. Most of our clients purchase sarees for weddings. Since weddings and events were cancelled it directly affected the business and most in the wedding and events industry.Q: How did you restructure the business?A: We didn’t have to restructure the business in a major way but we mostly take in clients through appointments to maintain social distancing as much as possible.Q: What was one thing impossible to do during the lockdowns?A: We have not changed our business much because our clients love what we do and therefore we hope to keep it the same way. The business is run by women for the women. It has been a fulfilling and rewarding experience working with wonderful clients even amidst the pandemic and trying times.****The online platform was the only optionJayendri Perera - Founder, Bollywood Fitness with Jay, and IT Project ManagerQ: As a young entrepreneur, how has it been dealing with Covid-19?A: It is so difficult to get work done. Exhausting and frustrating would be the exact words.The moment you think everything is starting to go well, another lockdown. However, staying strong and not losing hope, trying to incorporate positive ways to be engaged with my customer base as possible.Q: How did you restructure the business?A: With multiple travel restrictions and quarantine, curfews imposed, moving into virtual platforms was the only option to continue classes. I would be lying if I didn’t mention that this was unknown territory for me. However, with the support of clients, online classes have been a success.I was also able to use this period to focus on promoting my page and creating more awareness by collaborating with Yeti (online dance competition), I also got called to be featured on Model Katha hosted by Rozanne Diaz.Despite the native impacts, I would say there were positive impacts that came with COVID.Q: What was one thing impossible to do during the lockdowns?A: Convening online classes would be the ONE difficult task during the lockdown. There is a huge difference between in-person classes vs online classes.Q: How has your industry been affected by the Covid-19?A: Fitness workouts are most impactful when you can convene in-person sessions, as this motivates our clients and give them that break from a long day at the office.However, most clients have lost their motivation to be consistent with their workout routine since online classes have commenced. This has led to an increase in negative impacts not only on physical health but with mental health.Q: What’s your advice to young entrepreneurs?A: Don’t give up, and don’t lose hope.There’s a reason why you started your business. if it made you happy at a certain point in your life.Don’t let covid19, any other variant or a person let you stop from doing what you love. You have no idea the change you can bring into someone’ life.****Long-term plans were divided into simple yet effective short-term plansNadeeja Fernando Munasinghe - Founder / Owner & Designer at SereppuQ: As an entrepreneur, how has it been dealing with Covid-19?A: Entrepreneurship is always an exciting but risky business, even in the best of times. The last months could reasonably be called “the worst of times” that the world has collectively endured in recent memory, and most people’s response to such times is to avoid risk. Once hailed as a bright spot in the economy, today many of them are at the end of their runway.While struggling with the covid 19 pandemic, I always considered the health and well-being of my employees and customers as the top priority. However, as an entrepreneur, I also came across ample opportunities where others saw roadblocks!Q: How did you restructure the business?A: My business ‘Sereppu’ from the very beginning was structured in two models of virtual and physical stores so I really did not have to restructure just had to implement some extraordinary plans for my virtual store!Q: What was one thing impossible to do during the lockdowns?A: The Covid-19 pandemic of course has disrupted plans, changed priorities, scrambled existing projects, and made us all acutely aware of the fact that we cannot predict the future.So all the long term plans were divided into simple yet effective short term plans. Nothing was impossible for an experienced entrepreneur I’d rather admit but sourcing materials was sort of difficult.However, we were able to get the maximum use of the resources which were already available at our stores including some materials which were upset at corners due to my negligence. We managed to create some masterpieces out of them. Every single material at the store was utilized in the manufacturing process during the pandemic.Q: How has your industry been affected?A: The fashion and footwear industry has been negatively impacted by the coronavirus outbreak on every imaginable level; production has ceased, retailers have closed, demand has plummeted. However, the good news is its fashion. If you really understand the trends, if you make your product relevant just from a product point of view, you can still play. So it’s art and science. And the art part will always be strong in this industry.We have identified new strategic plans to spice up our virtual business and reach our physical clients virtually. It’s my belief that this unique set of circumstances can hopefully bring about a positive change in the fashion and footwear industry that has been needed for years.Q: What’s your advice to young entrepreneurs?A: My advice to young entrepreneurs is that if your sales have dipped during this period or your operations have shut down due to the lockdown, use this time to speak to your customers, brainstorm with your team and improve your offering.During the nationwide lockdown, we reached out to our customers for feedback and received some very valid and practical suggestions on how to improve our user journey and we also utilized the lockdown period to focus on implementing the feedback.This way, when the lockdown is lifted and when business is back to normal, you hit the ground running."

15 November 2020,Water… water…in every bottle,"Young boys and girls ambling to school and office workers travelling in buses and trains can be seen with bottles of water. Some of them carry ordinary bottles filled with tap water while others take plastic bottled water. Some of them may not know that bottled water has become a booming industry worldwide.I had a friend who always carried bottled water wherever he travelled. He used to say, “Water is the essence of life.” He always drank bottled water to remain healthy. However, he was taking treatment for various ailments. Nobody knows whether bottled water was the cause of such diseases. At restaurants and hotels in the city you are served with bottled water as if they are concerned about your health. In fashionable hotels in the West there is a water bar with some 100 selections. Bottled water manufacturers seem to be competing with wine.Wine is a form of manmade liquor. Grapes are crushed and processed to produce wine. But water is something which falls from heaven. The water eventually runs down streams, canals and rivers. People make reservoirs to collect rain water for drinking and irrigation purposes. In cities water is collected in tanks, purified and distributed through a network of pipes to the people. Once a minister claimed that tap water is safer than bottled water. Even a magazine published in England found that tap water from the Thames tasted better than some bottled waters which were 400 times more expensive than tap water.Dubious labelsThe Central Bus Stand in Colombo is full of vendors who sell bottled water which carries dubious labels and sources. Some people complain that the bottles contain only tap water. As the authorities have not tested or tasted the water in such bottles we never know whether it is tap water or water coming from the Beira Lake.In cities such as New York and Paris, there are more than 700 brands of bottled H2O. In the United States Eau de Bouteille has reached a high-water mark. Even some leading companies in Sri Lanka depend heavily on bottled water. Some companies deliver bottled water to houses and business establishments on a regular basis. In the United States and Europe more and more people have been drinking bottled water. In the United States alone 50 per cent of the people drink bottled water. The sales are growing about 10 per cent a year according to a recent survey. Whether you believe it or not, bottled water is selling faster than any other beverage.The situation is quite different in Sri Lanka and neighbouring India. Even in cities all the people do not drink bottled water as it is quite expensive. In villages people still drink water drawn from wells and other water sources. In most villages in India water is scarce and people consider it as something sacred.Market leaderThe bottled water industry in the United States is estimated at $8 billion and it remains the market leader in the world. But some rich people still prefer bottled water produced in France. According to market analysts, bottled water is likely to overtake coffee to become the second most consumed beverage. Soft drinks still remain the first choice.There are many reasons for people to drink bottled water. The most important reason is safety. There are many water-borne diseases such as dysentery. And to avoid them, people drink bottled water. In developed countries there are many regulatory quality standards that apply to bottled water. It is questionable whether such stringent measures are adopted in developing countries.Those who drink bottled water are conscious about its health benefits. For instance, a 150-millilitre glass of wine contains 400 kilojoules, but bottled water is a kilojoule-free beverage. Today, expensive bottled water is fortified with nutritive trimmings such as calcium, vitamins and vegetable extracts and is called ‘Water Salad.’ In bottled water produced by leading companies there is a high-octane blend of potassium, calcium and magnesium. Such nutritive supplements are not found in ordinary tap water. However, it is questionable whether such nutritive supplements offer any real health benefits to consumers. Although there is no scientific proof about health benefits, consumers still prefer bottled water to tap water.ChemicalsIn industrialised countries water may contain certain chemicals which act on soap to form a scum. If water comes from a limestone area, some rock is dissolved in water and this makes it hard. But hard water can be treated to remove unwanted chemicals. In the home small amounts of washing soda or borax can be added. At large water softening plants which serve a community the water is filtered through a mineral called zeolite which removes the chemicals.Village folk usually boil the water before drinking. Boiling can destroy the bacteria found in water but it cannot remove the chemicals. However, this is the oldest method of purifying water. Boiling is sufficient if the village is situated away from an industrial city. As poor villagers cannot afford to buy bottled water or water filters, the government has to supply them with filtered water at a nominal cost.Where do you find the purest water in the world? According to Filip Wretman who was the first water sommelier at the Ritz-Carlton, the purest water is found in the Norwegian artesian water Voss. The water is taken from a virgin aquifer (a very clean underground well) and bottled before it is sullied by exposure to the air. Voss is said to be the number one nonalcoholic pick of Madonna who refuses to stay at hotels that do not stock it. Even the bottle was designed by none other than Calvin Klein.More hintsWretman gives some more hints on bottled water. He says a slightly chilled bottle of San Pellegrino would be an ideal choice. He also recommends Fiji water that comes from rain that fell 450 years ago on the pristine South Pacific Island. Finally, he wants you to try Perrier with your cheese or chocolate soufflé. However, there are many other brands you can try if you happen to visit the United States or European countries. King Island Cloud Juice guarantees 4,875 drops of Tasmanian rainwater per 375-millilitre bottle. Lurisia is melted Italian snow water that seeps through a volcanic rock. Chatledon that comes from a village in Auvergne has no taste. Iceberg water is harvested from huge icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland.Arthur von Wiesenberger is a water critic known as ‘Water Master’ He is the author of four books including Oasis: The Complete Guide to Bottled Water throughout the World. He says plain old tap water is not that bad. New York City’s Municipal water has been dubbed the champagne of tap water which is known for its purity and taste.There is a battle for market share between soft drink manufacturers and bottled water companies. It is no longer a secret that 25 per cent of bottled water comes from tap water. Even well-known soft drink producers use more purified tap water than spring water.Nagging desireAlthough we are aware of the sources of bottled water and how it is marketed, we have a nagging desire that we should drink more bottled water than tap water. This may be due to the fact that we are more health conscious than others. And when we drink bottled water we appear more cultivated and cultured than others who do not do so. A diehard Marxist tells me that our desire for bottled water comes from a wellspring of capitalism whose source is deep in our culture.A court doctor is said to have presented Chartledon water to King Louis XIV promising it would “cure His Majesty sometimes, often alleviate his distress, and comfort him always.” Bottled water companies seem to be giving us the same prescription![email protected]"
26 April 2020,SLIIT Graduates geared with necessary skills to contribute to Sri Lankan economy during life after COVID-19 ,"22nd April 2020:In the past few months, COVID 19 has become the common enemy for humans across the world, and dealing with its impact on everyday life has become crucial. In Sri Lanka too, the prevailing situation presented a new set of challenges for all sectors and segments of communities.During curfew and lockdown periods, accessibility of daily essentials, medicine and healthcare services, financial services and other transactions have posed challenges for most citizens.However, as every dark cloud has a silver lining, there lies a great opportunity for information technology and ecommerce to flourish and placed at the forefront for both businesses and consumers.In the past few weeks, the nation has witnessed how many businesses quickly moved to online platform models partnering delivery logistics providers. Especially, Retail, Banking and Education too can benefit greatly from opportunities arising through e-commerce technology.As such, there will be tremendous opportunities for those with knowledge and skills to design, develop and maintain e-commerce platforms for existing and new businesses. Moreover, hybrid skill sets in both IT and business management will be critical in laying out new e-commerce business models.Specialists in the areas of Information Technologies, Data Sciences, Software Engineering, Computer networks, Information Systems, Business and Systems Analysis, Multimedia and Cyber security will also be of great demand in the post-Coronavirus pandemic era, not only in Sri Lanka but also in the global market.SLIIT, as the nation’s non-state degree awarding institute is poised to train the next generation of talent necessary to solve global challenges in health, wellness, computing, and engineering and to meet the needs generated as a result of the COVID-19 crisis aftermath.All programmes at SLIIT are introduced and based on applied education targeting the prevailing job market. Additionally, SLIIT’s focused academic approach ensures a strong emphasis on practical exposure and experience. SLIIT’s on-going relationship with business and industrial sectors has enabled the institute to become the first choice for intern recruitment and industrial training opportunities among the private sector. The institute’s state-of-the-art facilities provide students a unique learning experience that enables them to reach their maximum potential and succeed in the global arena.SLIIT’s Faculty of Computing continues to contribute significantly to national IT industry. During the past 20 years it has produced more that 60% of the total IT work force of the country offering students a broad range of degree programmes, SLIIT Computing students have direct access and knowledge of E-commerce and advances in technology.Additionally, the faculty also provides seven degree specialisations such as Information Technology, Software Engineering, Computer Systems and Network Engineering, Information Systems Engineering, Interactive Media and Cyber Security.

5 June 2021,Kala Pola support for artists amid pandemic,"Sri Lanka is known for talented artists that add value to the culture, heritage and diversity of the country. Both artists and art lovers alike look forward to ‘Kala Pola’ as Sri Lanka’s renowned annual fair for visual art.Conceptualised by the George Keyt Foundation in 1993 and supported by the unbroken patronage of the John Keells Group over the past 27 years, `Kala Pola’ has been promoting Sri Lankan art and providing opportunities for local artists over the past 28 years.‘Kala Pola’ focuses on fostering a space for artists and sculptors to learn, network and market art given the limited opportunities that are available to promote their work outside gallery spaces.The ongoing pandemic has exacerbated the challenges. As a solution to gathering restrictions, the art fair was hosted as an online event for the first time in 2021. The month-long event hosted on John Keells Foundation’s digital art gallery site www.srilankanartgallery.com from February 21 to March 21 featured over 4,000 works of 202 Sri Lankan artists.The event received a remarkable response attracting over 56,000 visitors from various parts of the world. Over 240 pieces of art were sold online to buyers in and outside Sri Lanka with artists also receiving commissioned orders.Online eventWith Nations Trust Bank (NTB) coming onboard as its Banking Partner, NTB’s Private Banking customers were hosted to an exclusive preview of the online event on February 20, one-day prior to opening for the general public, which also enhanced market potential of artists.Sharing his feedback on the virtual event, senior artist based in Galle. Thushan Illeperumarachchi stated that “even though I was quite skeptical about an art fair being taken online at first, I managed to sell about 17 paintings online and even though it was a new experience I think it was successful as it attracted many local and international buyers.As the event was one month long, it allowed buyers to leisurely go through our work and pick what they like. I hope we can continue both online and onsite Kala Pola in the future.”The virtual event also featured four fringe events to better engage collectors, artists, children and art lovers through `A Collector’s Guide - Start and build your own art collection’, two panel discussions entitled ‘Digital Transformation in the Art Industry’ and `Do Artists have a Place?’The online event was followed by a one-day pilot pop-up sale held at Arcade Independence Square, Colombo 7 featuring 25 senior artists who have been part of the event for 15 or more years.The event which was held in strict accordance to Covid-19 health and safety protocols, attracted 978 visitors and generated over Rs. 1.46 million in estimated sales revenue. Over 50 John Keells staff volunteers supported both initiatives.Works of artChairman, George Keyt Foundation Michael Anthonisz said “We are indeed very grateful to our partner - John Keells Group – for being agile and innovative in taking Kala Pola online this year, and providing artists a global platform for their work, despite the ongoing pandemic.Both events created an opportunity to exhibit and sell works of art and in these trying times this was of immense benefit to our artists.The George Keyt Foundation is very happy with the outcome of both events and values the continued support of John Keells in organising and funding this event.”“At a time when many local artists have been severely affected in reaching out to buyers as a result of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the John Keells Group together with the George Keyt Foundation remains committed to support and promote Sri Lankan artists”, said Carmeline Jayasuriya, Head of Operations, John Keells Foundation.“We are delighted at the response received from both artists and buyers to the pilot online event this year and hope to continue hosting such events to further the objectives of Kala Pola as well as the Group’s wider roadmap within the focus area of Arts and Culture”.Arts and culture is one of the six focus areas of John Keells Foundation - the CSR entity of John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH), Sri Lanka’s largest listed conglomerate in the Colombo Stock Exchange operating over 70 companies in seven diverse industry sectors.With a history of over 150 years, John Keells Group provides employment to over 14,000 persons and has been ranked as Sri Lanka’s ‘Most Respected Entity’ for the last 15 Years by LMD Magazine.Whilst being a full member of the World Economic Forum and a Participant of the UN Global Compact, JKH drives its CSR vision of “Empowering the Nation for Tomorrow” through John Keells Foundation and through the social entrepreneurship initiative, ‘Plastic cycle’, which is a catalyst in significantly reducing plastic pollution in Sri Lanka."
27 September 2020,Competing with competencies: Developing future-proof Sri Lankans,"Competencies are required in an increasingly competitive global environment. Sri Lanka occupied 84th place on the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) last year. This shows a dismal picture as Sri Lanka in 2012 was at 52, in 2015 at 68 and in 2016 at 71.Obviously, many fingers will be pointed at policymakers for their action and inaction. My intention is not to engage in a detailed analysis on the reasons but to reflect on what we can possibly do together as a nation. Today’s column focuses on future competencies for Sri Lankans that will ensure confidence in competing in local, regional and global spheres.OverviewThe future belongs to those who create it. In fact, we Sri Lankans are doing it on multiple fronts thanks to some enthusiastic professionals. The adequacy of political patronage for such initiatives is questionable.As it is often said, we are increasingly moving towards a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world, particularly after the Covid-19 pandemic. We see many political rumblings with multiple signals, retarding growth focus. Our neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh are much focused in their development plans and steadfast in their growth momentum.Will they beat us on the economic front by maintaining a higher growth rate to become a vibrant economy in South Asia, the way they beat us in cricket? Loads of food for thought. It was amazingly consistent at the deliberations in three international conferences last year, in Pune and Ahmadabad in India and Nadi in Fiji, which I participated in, with regards to comprehending competency needs.Competencies are the measurable or observable knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviour critical to successful job performance. Choosing the right set of competencies is core for consistent performance expected by an employee. What was echoed as future competencies can be easily labeled as ABCDE.Let’s see what they are:A: Analytical thinkingIrrespective of whether our background is science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) or not, the future demands us to be analytical. With the massive inflow of information, selecting, prioritising, focusing and deciding are key for speedy action. If we do not become smart in this terrain, what possibly could happen will be “analysis paralysis”.It further invites us to work systematically and logically to resolve problems, identify causation and anticipate unexpected results. It also involves managing issues by drawing on own experience and knowledge and calls on other resources as necessary.Undertaking complex tasks and breaking them down into manageable parts in a systematic way, thinking multiple possible causes and anticipating consequences of situations, thinking of possible alternatives for a situation, recognising and reconciling data discrepancies, identifying information needed to effectively solve problems, weighing the pros and cons of options and alternatives and systematically changes variables to determine effects on the whole are other associated activities.At a time when there is a conscious effort to shift GCE (AL) students from the arts stream to STEM areas, the emphasis on analytical skills is very relevant. Sharpness of reasoning than getting overly emotional in decision-making is what is acutely required at many social fronts.B: Business savvinessHaving a holistic understanding about the world of business is essential for any manager to perform and progress. The future demands us to move beyond our functional silos in becoming broader in our perspectives encompassing wider perspectives. Narrow specialty should pave the way for multi-skilling, perhaps retaining some specialty.If I take an HR executive as an example, does he or she know the business realities such as market conditions, competitor activities, opportunities and threats out there and the key people needs accordingly?I still recall, when I interviewed CEOs of South Asian countries, as a part of my doctoral research, a significant majority of them said, “My HR person knows HR, but he or she does not know business.” Partnering with the core business processes in getting connected to business related decision making is key for a collective contribution towards corporate success.As a nation are we there? is the big question. In the public and private sectors alike, what we sadly see missing is the much needed “holistic thinking”. How people pursue their personal agendas with a narrow ulterior perspective with gross ignorance or glaring inconsistency is very pathetic to observe.C: Creative mindsetCreative thinking is a mental activity, which produces new ideas or new insights. It does this by de-patterning or re-patterning thoughts. In fact, our mind is the sum total of our memories, images, desires, expectations, beliefs, feelings and other such mental processes. Thinking is, therefore, a sequence of images and events, which constitutes our mind.Creativity involves breaking patterns and thinking out of the box. A mind pattern based on traditional, or stale perceptions should give rise to a fresh new wave of creative thinking. The result is the generation of new ideas. Warren Bennis described creativity as a dimension of a “new paradigm” for managers.Despite the proliferation of automation, robotics and other vistas with Artificial Intelligence (AI), human creativity will be much in demand in the continuing era of imagination. Whether we make a conscious effort to foster creativity among the school children, leading to imagination and innovation is a question mark.D: Digital diligenceTechnology has always been an enhancer of our work. From adding machines to the advanced computer this was the case. Such extensive applications are broadly categorised as digital transformations. When integration of digital devices to our daily lives happens at an increasingly rapid pace, it is the survival of the fittest in being digitally diligent. In simple terms, it is about the smartness one demonstrates in embracing the change with regards to changing technology.It was Joseph Schumpeter, the Austrian-American economist who first spoke of a “gale of creative destruction” to sustain economic growth. We can see a parallel to that in the now popular use of the term “disruption”.Prof. Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School, widely regarded as the concept initiator of disruption, said that a disruption displaces an existing market, industry, or technology and produces something new and more efficient and worthwhile. Whilst being disruptive on one hand, it is creative on the other hand.“We are witnessing profound shifts across all industries, marked by the emergence of new business models, the disruption of incumbents and the reshaping of production, consumption, transportation and delivery systems,” says Klaus Schwab, in his most recent book, “Fourth Industrial Revolution”.Are we reaping the benefits of our digital initiatives? Perhaps to some extent. Creation of information and Communication Agency (ICTA) and recent revitalisation of it appear as constructive steps. Being ahead in South Asia with 4.5 G mobile communication technology is another sign to say that we have positive trends to encourage the society to be more digitally diligent.E: Emotional maturityTo harmonise the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) we need to foster Emotional Intelligence (EI). What is needed is AI-EI synergy in being high tech and high touch.As Daniel Goleman advocates, EI is a capacity for recognising our own feelings and those of others, for motivating ourselves, and for managing emotions well in ourselves and in our relationships.Despite many subsequent presentations and interpretations, I still prefer the five key components of EI advocated by Goleman. They are self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, empathy and effective relationships.If I am to single out, empathy is the key. To ensure lasting relationships and sustainable partnerships, one needs to demonstrate empathy. We need to make a conscious effort to move from taking one-sided emotionally-laden erratic decisions to a more mature platform. Sri Lankans have a long way to go in this respect.ABCDE competencies vs. connectionsI see a Human Resource issue at the macro level baffling national leaders. How to pick the right person for the right position, especially with regards to the key ones from a national perspective.We have seen bouquets and brickbatsby a section of the public through social media about certain recent appointments.It is pertinent to mention what David Oglivy, the advertising tycoon, had to say with respect to hiring: “If each of us hires people who are smaller than we are, we shall become a company of dwarfs, but if each of us hires people who are bigger than we are, we will become a company of giants.” The hiring process has to be professionally designed and executed to hire people with potential.ChallengesLeaders should be performers in practising what they preach. They inspire, influence and initiate in such a manner to ignite result-oriented action. In contrast, laggards are passengers. They hamper the progress by being lazy and lethargic. Indecisiveness resulting in inaction is often common in their approach.Do we see more leaders or laggards? The answer lies in the results they achieve. It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness. Living with leaders and laggards leaves us a less number of choices for achievement. Leaders have to be far more effective to overcome the ineffectiveness of laggards.Way forward“You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today” so said Abraham Lincoln. We need to embrace competencies needed for the future in the present itself. We need to train not only the current managers but also the emerging leaders in becoming future-proof. ABCDE is one clear way of awakening to the required competencies and to take key strategic initiatives accordingly.It reminds me what I learnt from my alma mater: “Disce aut Discede” in Latin meaning “Learn or Depart”. I think we need to interpret it in the contemporary private and public domain as “Perform or Depart”. Time is ripe for us to relentlessly strive to reap a rich harvest. "
12 September 2021,Tatas: Not merely about buses,"Title: The Tatas: How a Family Built a Business and a NationAuthor: Girish KuberTranslator: Vikrant PandePublisher: Harper BusinessWhat bus company has made the most number of buses running in Sri Lanka? Most probably it is the Tata bus company in India.Tata is the most sought-after brand when someone seeks to buy a bus (or lorry as well). Tata became such a familiar name for Sri Lankans that anyone knows that it refers to a bus. But Tata emerged not out of the bus category, but out of business by a respected and leading business family in India spanning 200 years. Girish Kuber, a veteran journalist, chronicles the story of this family legacy in this book.Nusserwanji TataIt all starts with Nusserwanji Tata, a middle-class Parsi priest from the village of Navsari in Gujarat, who was born in 1822. He headed to Bombay (now Mumbai) with his wife Jeevanbai and their infant child Jamsetji to start a business – a cotton trading. He was the first in his family to do so. However, he had neither higher education nor knowledge of business matters to engage in business, the only qualification he had was a burning passion to carve a path of his own.What Nusserwanji started as a cotton trading venture, his son Jamshetji Nusserwanji Tata (1839-1904) grew into a multifaceted business. He joined his father’s export trading firm in 1858 after an education at Elphinstone College in Bombay.In fact, he had an extraordinary business instinct and helped establish branches of the company in Japan, China, Europe, and the United States. In this way, starting from trading of cotton and opium (which was legal back then) he set up cotton mills in Nagpur and Mumbai.Then, laying the foundation of building India’s first steel manufacturing company and the Taj Mahal hotel, both of which fructified after his death and were nurtured and brought up by his two sons, Sir Dorabji Tata and Sir Ratan Tata.Their legacy was continued by Jehangir Rantanji Dadabhoy (JRD) Tata who dared to foray the group into aviation by setting up India’s first airline, Tata Aviation Services (originally an air mail service) and later rechristened Air India as India’s first commercial airline. Finally, Ratan Naval Tata, who succeeded JRD as the group chairman, led the group’s entry into the information technology sector, apart from building passenger cars. Ratan Tata, born in 1937, became the fifth chairman of the Tata Group and retired in 2012.It is more than just a history of the industrial house; it is an inspiring account of India in the making. It chronicles how each generation of the family invested not only in the expansion of its own business interests but also in nation building.Few know, for instance, that the first hydro power project in the world was conceived and built by the Tatas. Nor that some radical labour concepts such as eight-hour work shifts were born in India, at the Tata mill in Nagpur. The Tata Cancer Research Centre, the Indian Institute of Science, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, as also the national carrier Air India - the family has a long, rich and unrivalled legacy.The book is a tribute to a line of visionaries who have a special place in the hearts and minds of ordinary Indians. And it is also the only book that tells the complete Tata story spanning almost two hundred years.Family treeIt is clear for readers if the family tree of Tatas is mentioned. As described earlier, the business of Tatas started from Nusserwanji Tata (1822 - 1904). Nusserwanji had five children, but three of them died early and two, Jamshetji and Virbalji, survived. Jamshetji (born on March 3, 1839 – died on May 19, 1904) took the baton of business from his father, earning a name as one of the fathers of Indian industry.Jamsetji had two sons, Dorabji and Ratanji. Dorabji Tata, the elder son (1859-1932) became a prominent Indian industrialist, philanthropist and the second Chairman of the Tata Group. His wife, Meherbai Tata, was the paternal aunt of nuclear scientist Homi J. Bhabha. But the couple had no children. The younger son Ratanji Tata (1871–1918) was a philanthropist and pioneer of poverty studies. After Ratanji Tata died without children, his wife, Navajbai Tata, adopted an orphan named Naval and raised him as her own son.This orphan boy, Naval Tata’s (1904–1989), biological maternal grandmother was the sister of Hirabai Tata, wife of group founder Jamshetji Tata. Also, his biological father, Hormusji Tata, had belonged to the broader Tata family, and Naval, therefore, carried the surname “Tata” by birthright.Director in several Tata companies, ILO member, recipient of Padma Bhushan, he married twice and had three sons. The first two, Ratan Tata and Jimmy Tata were from his first wife, Sooni Commissariat, while third son, Noel Tata, was from his second wife, Simone Naval Tata, a Swiss woman and a Catholic - she ran Lakme and served as chairperson of Trent. So Noel Tata ended up becoming chairperson of Trent, and Ratan Tata, born in 1937, became fifth Chairman of the Tata Group.There is another character in the Tatas’ family who became the fourth Chairman of the Tata Group and pioneered Indian aviation and founded Tata Airlines (later known as Air India). He is J. R. D. Tata (1904–1993), son of Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata. Who is Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata? He (1856–1926) was one of the early stalwarts to serve the Tata Group. His father Dadabhoy and Jeevanbai - mother of Jamshetji Tata - were siblings.Importance of the bookThis book won the Gaja Capital Business Book Prize in 2019, and has many interesting anecdotes of stories, struggles, trials and tribulations, and also many jubilations behind the family’s journey. By and large, three themes spring up from it. The first is how the Tatas contributed to nation building at a time when the British were very much ruling India.The second theme that comes out strongly is how the Tatas nurtured its employees. When Jamsetji set up Empress Mills in Nagpur, the city was laid back; absenteeism was common. Jamsetji devised a retirement fund and an insurance policy to cover medical costs for injuries incurred at work, among the earliest known examples of employee welfare schemes in India.The third is about the Tatas, especially JRD (Jehangir Rantanji Dadabhoy) Tata, struggled with India’s political heads, particularly in the first two decades after India’s independence – JRDs struggled with politicians such as Mahatma Ghandi, Nehru, and it continued until Indira Gandhi and Morarji Desai as well though Nehru family was his close associate.Writing to ‘Moneycontrol’ magazine in Mumbai, Kayezad E. Adajania, the head of the personal finance bureau at ‘Moneycontrol’, said that the only flaw of the book is that it comes off as slightly one-sided. For the many successes of the Tatas that the book focuses on, its failures aren’t much highlighted. A whole chapter is focused on the struggles that Ratan N. Tata went through to realise his dream small car, but the book is silent on Nano’s struggles in subsequent years after launch. Other businesses that are struggling like aviation or that didn’t yield much like the group’s entry into telecom and its ill-fated acquisition of Corus - Europe’s second-largest steel producer - are virtually absent from the book.About the author and the translatorThe author of this book Girish Kuber is the editor of Loksatta, a Marathi daily from the Indian Express Group. He is a regular columnist in the Indian Express, and also an author of six books in Marathi. Kuber originally wrote and published this book in Marathi in 2015.

19 July 2020,  External sector showed signs of stabilisation in May,"The external sector showed signs of stabilisation, with the removal of most lockdown measures in the second week of May.The impact of restrictions on non essential imports was observed in May with a notable reduction in merchandise imports. Meanwhile, merchandise exports, which dropped significantly in April, rebounded more than expected during the month. Workers’ remittances were significantly low in May compared to the corresponding period  last year, but recorded a notable increase compared to the extreme low levels recorded in April this year.In relation to financial flows, the total exposure of foreign investment in the GovernmentSecurities market remained significantly low with a marginal outflow being recorded in May. With the resumption of trading in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in mid May 2020, there were some outflows of foreign investment.The Sri Lankan rupee stabilised, mainly aided by an improved trade deficit, recording an appreciation of 3.5 per cent during May.The deficit in the trade account narrowed by US $ 416 million in May to US dollars 407 million, from US dollars 823 million in May last year, as the decline in imports exceeded the decline in exports. On a cumulative basis, the trade deficit narrowed by US $ 180 million to US $ 3,100 million during the first five months of this year from US $ 3,281 million in the corresponding period of last year. Meanwhile, terms of trade, i.e., the ratio of the prices of exports to the prices of imports, improved by 20.6 per cent (year-on-year) in May 2020 with prices of exports having increased while prices of imports declined."
22 November 2020,Making youth entrepreneurship successful ,"Simply explained, entrepreneurship is known as the concept of starting, developing, and managing a business venture to make profits. The person who is willing to undertake a challenge and the related risks is an entrepreneur.Among many factors, some of the key elements of entrepreneurship success are dependent on the skills, knowledge, creativity, self-confidence, and the personal commitment of the entrepreneur. An independent entrepreneur is appreciated in society as they are considered as individuals who are willing to take personal risks to reach the predetermined heights in the business world.Under the sub-heading 'Harnessing the power of youth' in chapter four of the Presidential manifesto, special consideration is given to youth entrepreneurship. Besides, President GotabayaRajapaksa, in many forums, has reiterated the importance of entrepreneurship.His opinion is that the youth must be self-employed through the plenty of avenues available in the country and become independent rather than hunt for government jobs. The manifesto pledges extensive opportunities and ample incentives to create an economy driven by young entrepreneurs.Sri Lankan youth must be made aware of the key role they can play by being in business. By using the skills and initiatives, they can play a critical role in the economy. On one hand, they cease to be a burden on the economy and society and on the other hand provide for others to be independent by creating employment. Therefore, nurturing entrepreneurship will have an immensely positive impact on the economy and society. New entrepreneurs contribute to the national income by creating new wealth and new markets.CareersEntrepreneurship is the best career option available to a person keen to take on a challenge, at any age. For example, in my forty-year career, I was at one time employed by an entrepreneur who had started his business at the age of 50 with a negligible capital and created a billion rupee venture in furniture and interior solutions in a few years.Contrarily, a young school leaver who visited me to sell digital marketing solutions some years back became the owner of a multimillion rupee business with a large staff in less than five years.Having control over work is something only a tiny percentage of people can enjoy. In addition, there are several other perks such as functional and financial independence, decision-making power, freedom of practicing innovative ideas, and more importantly, self-satisfaction is an important benefit available for an entrepreneur.However, a vital factor to remember is that entrepreneurship is not an ‘easy way out’ for someone who is not in favour of working under someone else. Successful entrepreneurship is much more momentous than that.There are various salient factors to entrepreneurship success. Let us discuss some of the key aspects. In my view, the first and foremost feature is the person’s willingness to take action without fear of failure. However, the important criterion is that the entrepreneur must be completely aware of the business he or she wants to be in.A thorough initial study of key aspects such as market feasibility, financial information such as capital and running expenditure, budgets, possible risks, and several other areas must be looked at even to start a small scale business. This information can be done simply without going into complex calculations.Creativity is an integral part of entrepreneurship to be successful in business. Most often the people enter into a business that already exists in the market. Hence, creative thinking of how to gain entry into the business, particularly in terms of marketing, is imperative. The entrepreneur should have an adequate level of intelligence to manage all anticipated situations from day one. The business owner must learn to be a problem solver as constant issues are part of business.Patience is important in business as the journey to success can often be demanding and thorny. Therefore, they must learn to make calculated decisions throughout the run.Every successful business owner I have come across during my career as an employer, buyer, supplier, or service provider is habitually oozing with self-confidence. Most often they are natural leaders whether they are educated professionals or common folk.Therefore, the self-confidence of an entrepreneur is an essential key factor in business success. Setting up a clear and measurable goal, preferably broken down to a few time slots is another vital factor to consider at the staff. In order to succeed, it is essential to keep a tab on the goals.Close and frequent monitoring of the pre-set goals against the progress is a must to have a clear impression of where the business currently stands.Step-by-stepAt the launch of a new business, setting up a structure as per the business plan is crucial.The organisational structure can be imaginary and in line with the goals already established based on the vision. Recruitment must be made according to the planned structure, on a step-by-step basis. My recommendation is to commence with the minimum possible employees and gradually work the way up.The essence of a new business venture is the workforce irrespective of the number. Therefore choosing the most suitable and the best people in the industry is important. The team, from the beginning, should be individuals with knowledge, skills, and character.However, selecting and recruiting the best workers is always a daunting task as whatever the theories and preparations used at interviews, the actual recruitment is done based on guessing who the best applicant is. Therefore, through my experience, I can confidently say that these guesses can go wrong time and again.As mentioned previously, building a successful and sustainable business, starting from zero, is an enormous personal undertaking. Therefore, going through a gradual process with patience is imperative.Breaking down every functional aspect into small and measurable steps is vital. As mentioned, the goal must be split into smaller targets with short time frames and work furiously to achieve.Many young entrants to business fail due to a lack of focus on the core business goal. An entrepreneur's life can be restless and scattered during the initial stages. Also, young entrepreneurs tend to work on too many different related sub-goals that make them concentrate on unnecessary diversions. Therefore, giving the best attention to the primary task is a crucial factor. Hence, my advice for youngsters is to avoid getting distracted by too many tasks and focus on one solid target.MentorsNew entrants to the business should look at mentors to get inspiration. Success stories of business leaders are a good example. To have mentors, one should not know them personally. Reading inspiring stories and biographies is one of the best methods to learn real lessons in business. In reality, a person can perhaps gather more information and derive knowledge by studying successful leaders more than all the theories that are learned from education. Particularly, for those who start with no experience, the following examples of mentors are the best way of gaining practical knowledge.In my next column, I hope to offer a few guidelines. However, a fact to remember is that succeeding in business is not an overnight process. The entrepreneurs have to develop strategies step by step and work their way up, whatever the required time frame is. Also, one must be aware of possible pitfalls, dangers, and the chances of failures as well.This is why the term 'risk-taking' is emphasised on every available definition of entrepreneurship. Business success will be a relatively easy task for those who can see opportunities without fearing failure, those who are enthusiastic, self-confident, and persons who can inspire others even in a depressing situation. "

15 August 2021,Trade deficit widens,"The deficit in the trade account widened on a year-on-year basis for the fourth consecutive month in June 2021. Both exports and imports were significantly higher in June 2021 compared to June 2020. Considering the first half of the year, although exports recorded a healthy growth, import expenditure increased at a higher pace, according to a media release by the Central Bank. Workers’ remittances recorded a year-on-year decline in June 2021, while earnings from tourism remained at minimal levels.In the financial account, both foreign investment in the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) continued to record marginal net outflows during the month. The Sri Lankan rupee remained broadly stable in June 2021The deficit in the trade account widened on a year-on-year basis to US dollars 652 million in June 2021 compared to the deficit of US dollars 161 million recorded in June 2020.The cumulative deficit in the trade account in the first half of the year also widened to US dollars 4,316 million from US dollars 3,262 million recorded in the corresponding period in 2020, and US dollars 3,597 million recorded in the corresponding period in 2019.

Exports improved by 12.9 per cent in June 2021 over May 2021."
31 May 2020,Compromise reached with rice mill owners,"While the Government made an effort to save the consumers and farmers without affecting the distribution, from yesterday, the Consumer Affairs Authority began raids on rice traders to check if they comply with the new controlled price regime announced by the State recently.The Government revised the fixed prices of three varieties of rice, Keeri Samba, Samba and Nadu, on three occasions mainly to protect the consumers affected by Covid-19 related issues. As of now, the prices remain at Rs.120 for Keeri Samba, Rs. 98 for samba and Rs.96 for Nadu.The latest price revision came after the Government took into consideration the rice mill owners’ woes and expert advice as well as the farmers’ and the consumers’ complaints.Former Mahaweli State Minister, Roshan Ranasinghe, told the media recently that the Government should have the interest of the masses when deciding on a fixed price for rice, adding that large scale owners of the rice mills monopolise the market for their gain.Ranasinghe said he had proposed to the Government to take action to put an end to the country’s rice monopoly and to restore the operations of small and medium-sized rice mills.“I have requested the President to set up three rice mills run by the State. Also, small and medium scale rice mills need to be uplifted.However, the number one priority is to eliminate the rice and paddy monopoly in the country” he added.Rice mafia, no moreMeanwhile, at a press conference last week, leader of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya, Udaya Gammanpila, said that the rice mill mafia had only existed during the last government.“There is no such thing as a rice mafia today. Sathosa is buying paddy from farmers, assisted by the Paddy Marketing Board. The military is now managing the stock. Mill owners who have created a scarcity in the rice market have now lost the opportunity to increase their prices,” he added. Until May this year, rice producers had purchased a kilo of paddy at Rs. 50 and it was subjected to the Government’s maximum retail price of Rs. 98 per kilo of rice. But in a recent gazette notification, the Government reduced a kilo of nadu rice from Rs. 98 to Rs.90, which ultimately created a scarcity in the market since the mill owners refused to release rice at the controlled price.The new gazette notification has been issued based on the profit earned by the rice producers in the absence of a controlled price.However, as there was no rice in the retail outlets under the controlled price, officials of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) visited major rice mill operators in Polonnaruwa recently. Their visit to famous rice mill operator, Dudley Sirisena, brother of former President Maithripala Sirisena was made public via social media. Sirisena’s rice factory was inspected by officers of the CAA headed by its chief, Major General (Rtd) Shantha Dissanayake on May 23. During this tour, Sirisena stressed that they cannot sell rice at the price set by the Government due to the ‘substantial losses’ that it would create.“Instead of selling rice at the controlled price, I am ready to go to jail” Dudley Sirisena, the owner of Araliya Mills told CAA officers.SettlementIn this backdrop, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa met large scale rice mills operators last Wednesday in Colombo, reaching a settlement to release rice to the market under newly introduced controlled prices. Following this meeting, the rice mill operators agreed to release Nadu at Rs. 96 per kilo and Samba at Rs. 98 per kilo to the market.The maximum retail price of Kekulu and Keeri samba will be Rs. 93 and Rs. 120.Even though a settlement was finally reached and rice stocks are back in the market, in situations like these in the past, it was evident that the State mechanism is incapable of controlling the price of rice. As experts have opined on many occasions keeping enough rice and paddy stocks with the Paddy Marketing Board is a viable solution to control the market price for rice. Currently, the Army is deployed in the paddy purchasing of the Paddy Marketing Board and athe Consumer Affairs Authority is headed by an ex-Army officer. Therefore, this may be an opportunity for the country to re-look into the entire market behaviour and take strong decisions for the betterment of the public.There are a few things to consider when it comes to the price of rice. It is the staple food in Sri Lanka. Hence, there should be a mechanism to buy rice without any inconvenience to the public.In other words, rice has to be an abundant food item at an affordable price. Also, it is not the intermediary, the processer or the trader but the farmer who should always receive the lion’s share of the profit. However, the rice trader also deserves a reasonable profit. There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their livelihood by contributing to rice production. Especially, as our state mechanism is not strong enough to be involved in rice production, a high-level contribution from the private sector is vital.As a short term strategy introducing a fair mechanism to monitor and execute decisions from the cultivation to products entering the market is necessary. It is important to look for the problem, intervene to solve it and then to follow-up.Appropriate solutions should be implemented by looking at all stakeholders from time to time. In conclusion, the rice market is not just a matter of controlling prices. "

28 March 2021,Legal action against errant coconut oil importers,"Trade Minister Dr. Bandula Gunawardana told Parliament on Friday that legal action will be taken against those who imported unrefined coconut oil that contained carcinogens.The Minister said that no political intervention will be allowed when the culprits are brought to book. He said, “In Dambulla, traditional coconut oil producers had revealed to the media that there is an attempt to release a consignment of imported coconut oil that contains carcinogens. When this was published in the media, I called the Chairman of the Consumer Affairs Authority and asked him to investigate. It was learned that unrefined coconut oil has been imported to the country for a long time.”Minister Gunawardana said investigations revealed that the oil contained toxins and the stock of oil has been stored in warehouses for re-export. “These stocks have not been released to the market. They have to be re-exported,” he said.Dr. Gunawardena said the Sri Lanka Standards Institution and the Food Division of the Department of Health investigated the matter. Due to the quantity of coconut oil which is unfit for human consumption in these containers, it has been ordered to re-export it.A party has requested an investigation from the CID in this regard. We urge the IGP to expedite the investigation and find out the culprits. Sri Lanka Standards Institute (SLSI) Director General Dr. Siddhika Senaratne issuing a media release on Friday, said it has been observed that the media and social media have hyped a fabricated and false allegation that senior officials of the Sri Lanka Standards Institution had authorised the sale of unhealthy coconut oil imported to the country by four importers.The SLSI, being the standards body for quality to the nation, will not compromise the set standards for any commodity or material that will be detrimental to the lives and livelihood of Sri Lankans.The media release added that the SLSI continuously conducts laboratory testing for Aflatoxin in coconut oil imported into the country by all importers to ascertain that it conforms to the set standard of 10micro grams/Kg.Contrary to false media reports, 13 containers of coconut oil have not been approved for sales to consumers by any authority. The Consumer Affairs Authority has also decided to test the quality of coconut oil in the market."
5 July 2020,You need to know ,"New to the startup world? You’re in the right place; our handy list busts the jargon for aspiring and early entrepreneurs alike. Ten years ago, many of these words didn’t really exist, or weren’t used in the same way. It’s only with the rise in startups across the globe that a whole new vocabulary has come about.So much so, that lingo like ‘unicorn’and ‘pivot’ in the context of entrepreneurship are being used more and more by people outside the startup sphere.Since you’re bound to come across these terms at some point (they’re sprinkled throughout our books and our site), here’s a handy resource to reference whenever you need to.ACCELERATORSomething to do with speeding down the highway? Not quite. An accelerator is an organisation or program that offers advice, mentorship and resources to help small businesses grow.This type of investment typically happens when a startup is in its early stages; it’s when an investor, or a ‘business angel,’ provides startups with initial or growth capital for a stake in the company. Having invested in big names like Google and Uber, CEO of Amazon Jeff Bezos is one of the world’s most well known angel investors.BOOTSTRAPEver heard the phrase pulling oneself up by one’s bootstraps? Well, this term has evolved from it and it means to self-fund using personal resources, like friends and family, to get cash going.BRIDGE LOANA loan taken out for a short-term period, typically between two weeks and three years, until long-term financing can be arranged. Also known as a swing loan.Quite literally, how fast you are spending your money. Alternatively referred to as a run rate, don’t be surprised if you hear this term being tossed around at industry networking events.Founders sometimes develop an exit business strategy before or during their entrepreneurial journey. An exit is a way to transition the ownership of your company to another company and pay back your investors.INCUBATORAn incubator differs from an accelerator in that it supports startups in their early development stages. It’s essentially an organisation that nurtures young firms during their first few months or years, usually in exchange for equity.IPO (INITIAL PUBLIC OFFRING)When a startup’s shares of stock are made public for the first time, it’s called an IPO. At this point, a private organisation turns into a public company.A method used to validate a business concept quickly and cheaply when founding a new company or introducing a new product.A technique which involves the development of a basic version of a new product that aims to satisfy its early adopters. The product is then developed with further features only after considering feedback from initial users.PITCH DECKIf you’ve ever had to pitch an idea to your boss before, you probably tried your best to be convincing. Similarly, a pitch deck is a short version of a business plan which presents key figures to potential investors in hopes of winning them over.PIVOTMuch like its meaning when used to describe a mechanism turning on a central point, the term pivot in the startup world occurs when a company quickly changes directions after previously targeting a different market segment.SCALE UP You can say you’ve scaled up when your company has grown in terms of size, geographical location, market and other relevant factors.The noun scaleup refers to a company that has already validated its product in a market and is economically sustainable.SEED FUNDINGThe first round of small, early-stage investment from family members, friends, banks or an investor is commonly referred to as seed funding.STARTUPThough there’s no universal definition of a startup, one that’s generally accepted is that it’s a company in the early or growth stages of operation, usually under three years old and (if not already) becoming profitable.TERM SHEET/LETTER OF INTENT The document between an investor and a startup including the basic terms and conditions for financing which is commonly non-binding.

5 September 2021,CSE seeks root cause analysis from system provider,"The Colombo Stock Exchange has requested a root cause analysis from the system provider, Iron One Technologies (Pvt) Limited regarding a disruption to the order management system provided to four stockbroker firms during trading recently, which resulted in trading difficulties to clients of these firms. System providers are an integral element of a technologically driven, smoothly functioning capital market, especially in the perspective of investor accessibility. The CSE therefore stresses the importance of system providers taking all possible proactive and preventative measures to provide seamless services and access to investors. The exchange did not view completely limiting market access to local and international investors via a trading halt as a viable response to system difficulties faced by one system provider.A CSE spokesman said close supervision and monitoring of system providers would be done on a continuous basis. and that a WhatsApp message being circulated alleging CSE manipulation in  trading is completely false and misleading. "

20 September 2020,Progress of sectors under NES not adequate - Past NEC Chief,"The progress of sectors under the National Export Strategy (NES) is not satisfactory despite the efforts to achieve the outcomes of the national strategy said the past head of the National Export Chamber on the progress of the NES.National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) Immediate Past President Ramal G. Jasinghe said although there have been efforts to deliver the expected outcome of the NES it is clear that the progress under the sectors are not sufficient.There should be greater  focus on the IT-BPM sector given the unexpected boost of digitisation as a result of the global pandemic to exploit the changing work ecosystems.He said that the processed food and beverage sector has overall,  sustained their exports, given the nature of the exports, and its necessity due to the pandemic situation.However, he said looking deeply into value addition, the products exported are not on par with the regional players. The exploitation of plus factors, such as the medicinal value of Sri Lankan food products and its use in traditional processing methods, specialised and developed  in this country could be a strong differentiator.On the other hand improving productivity and quality of the output of processing operations is a significant need to meet the needs of the global market.He said the NES focuses on five main export areas such as processed food and beverage sector, spices and concentrates, IT-BPM, boating industry, wellness tourism and electrical and electronic components. The overall export performance, during 2019, exports grew by 14.4 percent with a value of USD 16,140 million.This growth was mainly due to industrial exports and agricultural exports indicated a decline. Regarding the NES, the favourable impact of the restoration of the EU GSP+ facility, conducive external trade policies with improved institutional support and some trade diversion resulting from the US-China trade tensions helped increase export earnings. However,  we have experienced and faced the brunt of the global economic contraction due to the  Covid-19 pandemic. On capitalising of the global shift from US and China for sourcing Jasinghe said Japanese investments moving away from China could be an opportunity for Sri Lanka.The country should  explore the opportunity of attracting Export Catalyst Investments and technology transferring partnerships as a way forward.To do business with the Japanese, one should maintain extremely transparent and ethical business practices, therefore, Sri Lankan business should build the infra structure, to be appealing to such global investors. Regional opportunity with the East Asian countries – taking into account the growth potential still lying within the East Asian countries; Sri Lanka could enter into partnerships and carefully negotiated bi-lateral or multilateral trade arrangements to reap benefits from the available potential.  Stressing on the need to create a conducive business environment in the country for export oriented investments Jasinghe said the country also should attract the investments and technologies to make use of these opportunities by building a conducive business environment. Sri Lankan exporters are doing their best within their capacities to exploit new markets related to the changes in the international market place which has been affected by the Covid-19 crisis. The Export Development Board (EDB) in consultation with Sri Lankan Missions Overseas is spearheading efforts to identify the emerging opportunities in international markets and guide exporters.Exporters have  used this opportunity to reach newer markets. For example Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) and rubber based products such as face masks were targeted at 12 markets, protective gowns sent to 17 markets. Exports that amounted to USD 227 million during April 2020, increased to USD 606 million by May 2020. However, he noted the challenge to the exporters is to develop innovative products to suit the emerging demands from the international markets in the post pandemic era, provide  wider digitised service exports, managing internal and domestic costs to ensure that competitiveness is maintained, maintaining sustainability related responsibility within the entire supply chain are factors that stands out at present.“Adopting strategies to face the aforementioned challenges, is workable, and has been proven by the resilience and innovative nature of the export community, to make use of this unprecedented opportunity and place Sri Lanka’s exports firmly on the global map,” Jasinghe said."
21 March 2021,Lanka’s potential to mark global transportation presence immense - Hanif Yusoof,"Sri Lanka enjoys the geographical advantage of being in close proximity to the maritime silk route and having less congestions and delays compared to regional airports  it should leverage on the benefits to mark its presence in the global transport industry, said Expolanka Holdings CEO Hanif Yusoof in an interview with the Sunday Observer Business last week.He said the right mix of infrastructure development, streamlined processes and industry best practices will enable to achieve the feat soon. Expolanka Holdings, a global diversified conglomerate is looking at expanding its local and international customer offerings this year.The Group specialised in logistics, leisure and investments  performed well withstanding the pandemic maximising on opportunities emerging from the global crisis.“We were able to do well even during the height of the crisis was  largely due to our ability to adapt to challenges and maximise on opportunities that arose out of the pandemic,” Yusoof said, adding that  while the company continues to grow its freight arm of the business, it plans to look at areas such “We believe that it is vital to be part of a wider section of the customer’s overall logistics requirements,” Yusoof said. Logistics, a large component of Expolanka’s business is an industry that is prone to disruptions and challenges that requires a business model that is agile and able to react when times are uncertain. “The most important contributor towards our success over the past year was in managing yields and leveraging our long-term carrier relationships to facilitate the needs of our global customers,” Yusoof said.“Market conditions were dynamic, capacity was low, supply chains were disrupted and customers had expectations all which had to be met while the world braved a pandemic. Our teams secured Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) shipments and conducted charter operations and moved away from the traditional cargo services. “Even today, with some markets returning to normalcy and less demand for PPE and related cargo, our model remains the same, to be ready for upcoming shifts in global trade,” Yusoof said. For the company to do well and support its customers, “we ensured that our teams were able to operate in the best possible working conditions during the last year. Each of the global and local offices implemented their own health and safety guidelines based on the ground situation and in line with government initiated protocols. “As an organisation, our focus has always been on the safety and well-being of our employees and all necessary best practices are being followed to ensure timely delivery of services to customers.Like most companies, we executed our BCP’s, established monitoring mechanisms and implemented guidelines across the network,” Yusoof said. Going forward Yusoof said the company has been gradually growing its Third-Party Logistics (3PL) service offering in certain select markets including Sri Lanka with the aim of repositioning ourselves as a more solution based logistics provider, offering end to end supply chain solutions. “One of the things that arose from the pandemic is the realisation by customers to use the right partners to manage all aspects of their supply chain and we are exploring opportunities on how we can leverage our existing infrastructure and network to do that,” Yusoof said, adding that the company’s  focus remains on integrated technology with a view to providing more visibility, transparency whilst enabling operational efficiencies internally. He said automation will play an important role in this journey and are constantly evaluating means of  enhancing operations through the use of technology. Expolanka was the first to launch free-port operations under commercial hub guidelines and are actively working with all the authorities to help the country realise its true potential of being a global transshipment hub.On the leisure sector he said the focus is  on stabilising the company during these challenging times, improving our efficiencies to optimise our performance once the industry returns to normalcy. The changes we have identified are simply directed towards increasing focus on certain operating verticals, enhancing closeness to our customers, new solutions and value added offerings, focusing on experiential and innovative travel solutions, introducing technology to make the customer journey more efficient and memorable while remaining operationally efficient. “The progress we have made with the tourism bubble are all good steps in the right direction and a more concentrated, unified and well thought out approach will definitely help Sri Lanka recover in this Industry,” Yusoof said. "

14 February 2021,CSE performance recognised worldwide - State Finance Minister,"The consistent performance of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) which has been recognised worldwide is a reflection of the growth of the economy despite the challenging times, said State Minister of Finance Ajith Nivard Cabraal.He said the rating by world bodies of the performance of the equity market of Sri Lanka reflects the sentiments of the local and foreign investors who have reposed immense faith in the policies of the government which are aimed at strengthening the macro-economic fundamentals and driving economic growth. “Since taking over the reigns in 2019 President GotabayaRajapaksa and the new Government have been pushing for policy reforms to boost economic growth,” the Minister said, adding that the positive sentiments on the performance of the market has been felt across the country which is an incentive for more local especially SMEs and other institutional investors to come into the market.However, the Opposition and certain sections allege that there has been pump and dump in the CSE enabling the market to expand artificially in recent weeks and that it is a repetition of the trend that took place from around 2012 to 2014.“It was dump, dump and dump during the ‘Yahapalana’ regime which led to the crash of the stock market and economy. It was during the former regime that broad daylight robberies took place.Investors were driven away due to chaotic policies. Such bankrupt elements and so called ‘economic experts’ didn’t  do anything other than talking big and taking the people for a ride for five years,” the minister said, adding that now they have woken up to the bitter truth which they find difficult to stomach. He said the Government has stabilised the rupee and the foreign exchange and have created an enabling environment for investors.The Rupee was at its worst state during the former regime and no investors dared to come . The Rupee depreciated to Rs. 196 against the USD in mid January this year and thereafter  showed some stability hovering around 190 in the recent weeks following intervention of the regulator. “People today see action and  light at the end of the tunnel and are confident of investing and doing business. We will revive the economy and make it the best in the region soon,” the State Minister said.The Colombo Stock Exchange has been rated the  best performing exchange in the world in recent times and the main index of the Exchange, the All Share Price Index (ASPI) was  ranked  the second best performing stock index in the world as of January 13, 2021 according to Bloomberg."
7 June 2020,         A fresh start for Sri Lankan business,"It is clear that the extent of damage coronavirus has caused the entire world is mind boggling. Plenty of things were discussed in the world media during the past four months about the negative effects of the pandemic.However, despite the colossal destruction, it offers unparalleled opportunities to us in terms of international trade and in the native business environment. Right now, not only Sri Lanka but also most other countries in the world are preparing to address the big question: How to recover and get their respective economies running.The big question is that do we take the country back to where it was before the pandemic or redesign to be better. The decision is entirely ours to move forward with the opportunities that are likely to be opened or ignored as we have done several times in the recent past. The virus has suddenly changed the context of the world at large. It has given us daring possibilities to advance in any direction we choose. This is an incredible freedom for the country.It is predominantly the decision of the President and the Government to decide what type of economic policies the country needs in terms of economy. President Rajapaksa has pledged a people centric economy with very effective and pragmatic proposals, mostly based on development of agriculture and native productions. The President has touched almost everything in this regard, in his economic policy statement. However, new post Covid 19 openings, locally and internationally, can assist his efforts more, if he and the Government decide to redesign. Since the outbreak, we see much more domestic representation in the markets and the economy, particularly in the Asian region. This current crisis has accelerated new trends such as digitalisation, technology, healthcare and so forth. In Sri Lanka this domestic awakening is clear with the willingness of business fraternity to invest in native production, largely due to the Government’s encouragement.Practical measuresLet us investigate what practical measures companies can be taken to discern, exploit and shape the post pandemic reality. Businesses anywhere in the world tend to become prejudiced and insular when under threat. The key concern is what action to be taken without a clear knowledge about the consequence.The opportunities are often born out of new consumer needs, hence learning about such needs are vital.  As the crisis still prevails, consumers themselves are not explicitly aware of their upcoming needs. Therefore, to understand the level of opportunity, companies need to look more deeply how social behaviour are shifting. For an example, if workers feel more comfortable working remotely, it can make a significant impact on office furniture, home remodeling and office equipment as well as electronic devices. Such behaviour obviously creates opportunities for relative businesses.The world will look different from what it was although the magnitude cannot be calculated as yet. Despite the pronouncements about working from home, the trend is yet to be identified. One certain thing is that e-commerce, e-payments, e-learning and e-health consultation seems to be in an upward trend.Many Sri Lankan larger players in banking, consumer marketing, health service and education service are already accelerating their efforts to be in the forefront of this trend. As for them, this is a strong future opportunity.So far as domestic manufacturing is concerned, Sri Lankan entrepreneurs involved in manufacturing will have an unmatchable opportunity to establish themselves against the country’s dominating imported products. This phenomenon was triggered by the President’s emphasis on the importance of promoting indigenous manufacturing. Ban of many imported items and restrictions imposed on others is a positive sign that the future is bright for local manufacturing.It was a shocking revelation that Sri Lanka is importing approximately 70% of its domestic requirements of consumer durables and nondurables including certain food related products. Due to Covid-19 these figures turned into common knowledge. We import countless products which can easily be manufactured locally and save foreign reserves. Consumers are also accustomed to give priority to a  majority of these imported products neglecting locally manufactured substitutes.Sri Lanka has an unlimited potential to export scores of products other than traditional tea, rubber and coconut. The present shift in political thinking helps these exports tremendously, if a proper order is introduced. For the past many decades, appropriate attention to this major opportunity was not given by the respective Governments. During the past two decades, Sri Lanka was enormously dependent on imports, particularly from China.SpicesWith more focus on segregation, value addition, brand building and upgrading the quality of products will be the required edge for our exports in the world arena. This is the time to aggressively market our spices which is known as the best in the world. The Export Development Board has identified several sectors where markets can be found. Apart from apparel, which is likely to take time to recover, the EDB has identified coconut and related products, floriculture, fruit and vegetables; IT related industries and seafood. Spices probably will have one of the best chances in exports.Sri Lanka’s knowledge industry will also have a huge opening in post Covid-19 markets. Social distancing and remote working will trigger a substantial demand for online operations. The knowledge based skills can be digitised in every field and can be delivered to the world. Computer literate youth will have a considerably large gateway to use their skills. As we know, many of the world’s most successful knowledge service companies are already operating in the country. These companies currently are supplying software solutions to top stock exchanges, airlines, retailers, accounting companies and banks.The impact of the virus has made people around the world shift more towards online transactions for many of the needs including medical, educational, retailing and many others. As Sri Lanka is known to have quality and qualified professionals, a large opportunity seems to be available in the future for this industry. However, the Government has to be more attentive and support growth of this important sector by offering assistance to source talent, cutting unnecessary red tape and by implementing friendly regulations.Despite the negative impact of the coronavirus, the crisis presents many new opportunities for Sri Lanka. Due to the effects of the situation, Sri Lanka’s usually smart business fraternity has come out with additional interest and eagerness by way of new thinking to make the best. Many of the corporates, large companies and SMEs have openly expressed their willingness to invest and develop various domestic and export oriented sectors. It is the responsibility of Government agencies to strip-away bureaucracy and traditional public service thinking and aggressively promote Sri Lankan exports and knowledge service sectors while developing native manufacturing to substitute unwanted imported non-essentials.  "
20 December 2020,CA Sri Lanka to transform SME entrepreneurs,"The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) last week kicked off a dynamic new initiative which aims to transform business owners in the SME sector into successful entrepreneurs across the county, with the ability to add value to the business world while contributing to the national economy.The mentoring initiative by CA Sri Lanka which is conducted in collaboration with Sanasa Development Bank PLC (SDB) was launched in Galle with the participation of a large number of owners of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) from the region.

5 July 2020,No depositor will be left high and dry -Central Bank,"The Central Bank will complete the second stage of recompensation for The Finance Company (TFC) depositors under the deposit insurance scheme soon and will explore the possibility of paying other depositors who had over Rs. 600,000 deposited in the company, after the legal issues have been sorted out, Central Bank Governor W.D. Lakshman said.“We will not leave any depositor in the lurch but would ensure the return of their hard earned money as soon as the legal issues have been cleared and funds come in,” the Governor said.However, as in the case of the ETI and certain other now defunct companies whose depositors are yet to receive their money, paying back the money of TFC depositors would be an uphill task for the regulator.Financial experts have been cautioning the authorities including the regulator about liquidity levels and the accompanying risk of certain financial institutions that lavishly paid high interest rates to lure in investors.“There is no point in shutting the door after the horse has bolted,” said a senior banker and financial analyst who has been blowing the whistle on certain financial institutions that had been continuing operations despite severe financial crises.“We have set up a committee comprising experts to monitor the companies identified as high risk entities to ensure they get out of the turbulence and safeguard the interest of its stakeholders ,”the Governor said.President Gotabaya Rajapaksa directed the Central Bank last week to take steps to compensate depositors of TFC and ETI companies after obtaining legal advice.He insisted that a committee comprising officials of the Presidential Secretariat, the Central Bank, the Treasury and the depositors be set up to monitor the process.Meanwhile, the Central Bank last week decided to implement a Credit Guarantee and Interest Subsidy Scheme to accelerate lending by banks to businesses affected by the pandemic.The scheme will operate parallel to the Saubagya Covid-19 Renaissance Facility and the new facility approved by the Monetary Board within the already announced threshold of Rs. 150 billion.Under this scheme, the Central Bank will provide a credit guarantee to banks, ranging from 80 per cent for small loans to 50 per cent for relatively large loans, enabling banks to grant loans to address the working capital needs of the affected businesses.With the Central Bank absorbing a significantly higher percentage of the credit risk, banks can extend their lending to vulnerable businesses focusing on the viability and cash flows of such businesses rather than collateral.Banks are expected to use their own funds, particularly the additional liquidity of close to Rs. 180 billion provided by the Central Bank through the cumulative reduction in the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) of 300 basis points thus far during the pandemic period, to grant loans at 4 per cent to businesses. The Central Bank will provide an interest subsidy of 5 per cent to cover the cost of funds to banks.Responding to media reports that vests the responsibility of failure and subsequent cancellation of licence of several finance companies which were licensed under the Finance Business Act, No. 42 of 2011 (FBA) the regulator stated that it carries out the regulation and supervision of licensed finance companies (LFCs) to ensure and strengthen the stability of the LFCs and in turn the stability of the financial system, which is one of the core objectives of the CBSL. “Stability is ensured through minimum capital, minimum liquidity, and provisioning requirements; regulation of investments to reduce concentration risk and corporate Governance requirements. LFCs are managed by boards of directors and key management personnel, which take independent business decisions and take full responsibility of managing the business. Such business decisions may lead to failure of such LFCs, despite continuous regulation and supervision by CBSL.Cancellation of the licence of an LFC, is the final step of a number of supervisory measures, and is done only when it is established that the continuation of the business would be detrimental to interests of its depositors and other creditors,” the regulator said.“The banking sector has liquidity remaining up to around Rs. 200 billion. It is now up to the banks to support the financial sector and the economy at large,” the Governor said. - LF"
11 April 2021,Challenge your boss for business progress,"Workplaces are no more places where you can have your own way. With so much diversity within organisations and with conflicting individual values and egos, there are times when dealing with your colleagues at work can evoke a mixture of complex emotions inside of you.While challenging your equals is relatively easy for you, it’s another thing entirely to challenge those who are above you. But there are times when you have to challenge your boss. Unless you have the courage to challenge, you will be a Yes Man who will never progress in career life. Challenging your boss at work is something that might cause weaker employees to crumble at their knees. The very idea of arguing or disagreeing with higher management might very well be the thing that could cause you to lose your job.However, people shouldn’t be afraid of standing up to their superiors at work, especially if the argument revolves around an important issue directly related to business matters. Despite what kind of professional relationship you might have with your superior, there’s nothing for you to fear about engaging in some sort of debate with your boss if you are thinking about the wellbeing of the company you are working for. You need to challenge your boss in a constructive manner and end up being respected for your actions at the end of it. It is tricky when you have a beef with your boss. How do you disagree with a person who most likely hired you — and has the power to potentially fire you? Say something, and you run the risk of being seen as difficult or even adversarial. Stay silent, and you could seem ambivalent or complacent.But your boss wants you to be successful. Your company hired you because they think you are an asset, so bring your experience and point of view to the table — but do it strategically. Time it right Bringing something up at an inopportune time can spell doom for whatever issue you are trying to address. Choose the right moment — likely a private chat — to discuss things.Key in any negotiation is understanding what the other side values. The best way to get them to listen is to be able to reflect back to them that you understand what’s important to them and to the organisation.This might take some detective work on your part.It may be that you have to ask some good questions, because you may not understand what’s behind the decision or action that you’re disagreeing with. So before you state an opposing view, “You have to understand what it is you are disagreeing with at the root & how it kills value. You can use this information to frame your suggestion as something that’s different from theirs—but that still serves your boss’s ultimate purpose or priority.Make it their ideaIf you present information in the right way, you might change your boss’s mind about things — and let her come to her own conclusion.This approach will usually take more than one discussion, so don’t give up. Plan on having a few conversations over time to make this happen.Help them look goodWhen managers and bosses are dealing with their team, they get a lot of the brunt of what’s not working and the complaints. Remember that your boss is trying to look good, just like everyone else, and if you can help her do that, you have got a greater chance of success.You may not agree with them, and you may have some constructive feedback, but if they feel like you are trying to help them shine, they will be more open to your ideas.Don’t wait until the last minuteSometimes people will bring up a dissenting point of view after the fact, when no one can do anything about it, and that’s just not productive. No matter what, make your thoughts known while there’s still a potential opportunity to take action.Be prepared to loseThere is never any guarantee whether you will emerge as the victor of an argument with your boss, and if the end result paints you as the loser, then you need to be gracious about the outcome and move on.Even though you put up a good fight and managed to remain poised under pressure, you should still respect the decision of the aftermath and walk away from it knowing that you have said what you needed to say to your supervisor.When your boss sees that you are gracious in accepting the loss and emerges from the conflict with no hard feelings, then it helps them see that you are someone who understands the value of professionalism.Your gracious demeanor will allow them to raise their level of respect towards you, not to mention strengthening the level of trust, which just goes to show that you can survive a fight with your boss and live to tell it. There’s always a chance that you will speak your mind and nothing will change. And you have to mentally prepare for that possibility.Your point may be taken, but it may not be taken well, in that it’s not going to change anything. It doesn’t mean losing your job, it just means you may have to comply with something that your boss feels is the best approach.Know what is at stake Another thing that you need to take into serious consideration when picking a fight with your boss at work is that you should know exactly the reason why you are disagreeing with your immediate superior, and the possible consequences that could come out of that argument if your challenge was proved to be unsubstantiated and not objectively driven but personal.This is of the absolute importance because you need to see the bigger picture in any debate so that you will know exactly where you will stand once the issue is laid to rest."
17 May 2020,India’s coronavirus cluster at a vegetable market,"CHENNAI, May 16. (BBC) - On 5 May, Bharath Gupta, a district collector in southern India, learnt that the sprawling Koyambedu market in Chennai city was being temporarily closed.The reason: several vendors and labourers at the market had tested positive for coronavirus, and were being linked to a spate of cases in Chennai and surrounding areas.Mr Gupta knew of the market because every day, farmers from his district - Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh state - send trucks packed with tomatoes to Koyambedu, which is in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu.But what alarmed him was that the trucks are driven by locals, often accompanied by a helper or cleaner who loads and unloads the cargo, and sometimes a cashier, who collects money from the sale on behalf of farmers. They leave every night around 19:00, and return to Chittoor the following afternoon.On 6 May, officials in Chittoor began testing all of those who had been to the market since 20 April. Other districts in Andhra Pradesh, which also supplied to Koyambedu, followed suit.As of Wednesday, Chittoor had reported 43 new infections which could be traced back to Koyambedu. Meanwhile, across Tamil Nadu as a whole, more than 2,000 new infections - a little over a third of the state's active cases - have been linked to the market.India, which has nearly 50,000 active cases, is nearing two months of a countrywide lockdown. But in all that time, grocery stores and food markets have been allowed to stay open, classed as essential services.But now one of those markets is the source of India's biggest active cluster, with a far-reaching trail that is as tangled as the country's food supply chain. Unsurprisingly, it has sparked a public row over who is to blame, but it has also revealed the challenge of regulating India's bustling, crowded food markets, where space is a luxury and social distancing a fantasy.Spread over 65 acres in the heart of Chennai, the Koyambedu market is one of the largest in Asia. Wholesale and retail shops selling grains, fruits, vegetables and flowers draw tens of thousands of buyers every day. Add to that the shop owners, truck drivers and daily-wage labourers and it amounts to around a hundred thousand people, on average.""We have taken enough precautions, but when a pandemic spreads, it's bound to spread everywhere in the city,"" says D Karthikeyan, a senior official in the Chennai city corporation.The evidence of their efforts, he adds, is in the fact that the first Covid-19 case from the market was detected on 24 April, one month after the lockdown began.It was a 54-year-old vegetable vendor who lived in Pulianthope, a densely-populated neighbourhood that has emerged as a hotspot in Chennai.Mr Karthikeyan says it's unclear if she contracted the virus from the market or passed it on to people there. ""It's like a chicken and egg story. Which came first?""He says she led them to 45 positive cases, four of whom worked in the market. And then a barber who ran a shop outside the market tested positive: ""That fellow had cut hair for more than 100 people - 25 tested positive and 20 are daily-wage workers in the market.""So began another round of contact-tracing and testing. It led to truck drivers, daily-wage earners who load and unload the cargo, fruit, vegetable and flower vendors from across Chennai and Tamil Nadu, who travel to the market to buy produce that they take back and sell, and often the people they travel with in auto rickshaws or buses.And they, in turn, led officials to their families and others they came in contact with back home.In the last three weeks since the first infection linked to Koyambedu was detected, the cases have begun to add up.In that time, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur, two districts which border Chennai, added hundreds of new cases, taking each of their tallies from less than 60 to more than 400. In Cuddalore district, more than 200km away, 114 people who worked at the Koyambedu market tested positive on a single day. Eighty percent of the 348 positive cases in another district, Ariyalur, have been traced to the market - many of them daily-wage workers. In Andhra Pradesh, 28 people across seven districts who had visited the market tested positive on Friday.On 8 May, Tamil Nadu officials said 1,589 positive cases in the state could be traced to the market. The next day that number had jumped to 1,867, but there has been no update since then.But with 9,674 positive cases so far, Tamil Nadu is now among the worst-hit states in the country, second only to Maharashtra with 27,524.The question that seems to be on everyone's mind is: why didn't they close the market?Closing the market, Mr Kartikeyan explains, would have affected the livelihoods of so many farmers.""It's the sole [food] supply link to Chennai and its suburbs - 5,000 tonnes of fruits and vegetables are traded daily and 400 trucks of vegetables alone arrive every day,"" says Mr Kartikeyan.So despite the obvious risks, it stayed open.He says they also made several attempts to limit crowding, even offering to relocate many of the shops to other parts of the city, but the traders refused.During that time, Tamil Nadu announced a complete, more stringent lockdown for three days at the end of April, and people were seen thronging markets to stock up.Vendors at Koyambedu told BBC Tamil that thousands came to the market on 25 April and that ""there was no space to move"".On 28 April, the government shut down retail shops, and moved the fruit and flower market elsewhere in the city. Only wholesale shops were allowed to operate, but again, on 30 April, at the end of the three day lockdown, the market saw a huge crowd.As the cases continued to go up, Mr Kartikeyan says, they decided to close the market ""forcefully"" even though traders were unhappy with the decision.They have since been allotted shops at another market but they have been demanding that the Koyambedu market be reopened since the new market can only accommodate a few hundred shops.""It was a mistake to let the market function during the last 40 days of lockdown,"" says GD Rajasekar, head of the Koyambedu vegetable sellers' associations, told the BBC. He said they had made several suggestions, but officials had refused to listen to them.The state's chief minister has, however, blamed the traders, accusing them of not following the rules to curb the spread of the virus.But traders say these large, semi-formal markets in cities where land is scarce and costly are not designed for social distancing.""Social distancing cannot be adopted in these markets,"" says Raj Kumar Bhatia, secretary of the merchants association for the Azadpur market in India's capital, Delhi.It's Asia's largest fruit and vegetable market, trading in millions of tonnes of fresh produce daily, but it's quickly becoming a source of worry - 31 people from the market have tested positive so far. And news reports have begun to link a rise in cases in neighbouring Haryana state to the market.Azadpur also hosts auctions every day, from six in the morning to noon to set the price of produce - all of which is a risk with Covid-19.""We need people to bid and we need them to gather,"" says Mr Bhatia. But he says the fear of the virus is already keeping many traders and suppliers away - although there are 28,000 shops, goods are arriving for only 1,000 of them.With supplies already dropping, shutting the market in Azadpur would be as unpopular a decision as shutting the one in Koyambedu. But can Delhi afford to keep the market open? "

6 December 2020,Paradox navigation amid a planetary pandemic,"The second wave of Covid-19 in Sri Lanka has resulted in an increased volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. This is what is popularly known as VUCA 1.0.The needed response is VUCA 2.0 which stands for vision, understanding, confidence and agility. It may sound paradoxical to some, but possibilities are enormous. People professionals or Human Resource professionals can play a pivotal role in such a context. Today’s column is a reflection of rethinking of HR as “paradox navigation”.OverviewThe typical dictionary meaning of paradox is that it is “a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement or proposition which when investigated may prove to be well founded or true.” Navigation on the other hand means “the process or activity of accurately ascertaining one’s position and planning and following a route”. This is the acute need in front of HR professionals.As Prof. Ulrich from Michigan University explains, “navigating paradox means accepting, exploring, and dealing with the inevitable tensions in a business. They have to help the business to be both short and long term, top/down and bottom/up, global and local, divergent and convergent, strategic and operational, etc. By navigating these paradoxes, organisations are more able to respond to the demands of change in today’s business context.”In essence, “paradox navigation” is the ability to steer amidst the many embedded tensions in complex organisational operations. We can raise a few vital questions here. Does the HR professional effectively manage the tensions between high-level strategic issues and operational details? Does he or she effectively manage the tensions between internal focus on employees and external focus on customers and investors? Does he or she effectively manage the tension between taking time to gather information and making timely decisions? Does he or she effectively manage the tensions between global and local business demands? Does he or she effectively manage the tensions between the need for change (flexibility, adaptability) and stability (standardisation)?The reality is that the HR professionals are constantly wrestling with embedded tensions that must be resolved in some circumstances and cultivated in other circumstances in order to help the business move forward. Wisely navigating through these surrounded strains becomes one of the central challenges for modern HR professionals.Makes East and West meetIn digging deeper, I see a parallel between paradox navigation by western HR researchers and the Yin-Yang concept of eastern wisdom. In simple terms, yin is characterised as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity and night-time. Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and aggressive; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity and daytime.To put it even more precisely, yin and yang are complementary opposites that interact within a greater whole, as part of a dynamic system. Everything has yin and yang aspects, but either of these aspects may manifest more strongly in particular objects, and may ebb or flow over time. This is the nature of HRM in reality, where managing employee concerns and employer concerns need to take place with synergy and harmony.In other words, showcasing paradox navigation is one way of accepting the Eastern duality. This is very pertinent in the context of change where we are increasingly experiencing VUCA 1.0 that needed the response of VUCA 2.0 as we saw earlier. Paradox navigation can in fact move beyond HR. In a practical sense, every manager has to do so in some way or the other. In other words, it is the challenge of balancing the harmony between yin and yang.Moving from HRM to HPMIn navigating the paradox of managing people, a conceptual clarity is necessary with regards to the use of the word “resource” in identifying people. I came across this very interesting argument by Prof. Satish Kalra of Management Development Institute (MDI), India. According to him, treating human beings as a resource to be used or manipulated like any other resource is demeaning. With the increasing number of highly skilled knowledge workers, resentment of the word “resource” is likely to increase, since knowledge workers are inclined to be hostile to manipulation. They would prefer the organisation to enable them to fulﬁl their true potential and, in so doing, help the organisation to achieve its objectives.Prof. Kalra refers to the dictionary meaning of the term “potential” as “capable of coming into being or action”. “Human beings by nature are full of energy, capable of thinking and equipped with superior mental abilities; therefore, they are capable of being proactive as opposed to being reactive; their latent energies can “come into being”. In fact, the dictionary definition of potential also considers latent energy. “By using their potential, human beings are capable of taking charge of themselves. They need not be directed by external influences”, observes Prof. Kalra.“With the increase in the number of knowledge workers, employees today would most likely be inclined to develop and exploit their own potential unconditionally”. This is reinforced by the results of many studies. The findings of one such study done in India, indicate that the biggest motivational factor for knowledge workers is “personal growth” followed by “operational autonomy” and then by “task achievement”.Among the four major motivators, money was the least motivational factor. Personal growth is referred to as “the opportunity for individuals to realise their potential,” and operational autonomy is defined as “a work environment in which knowledge workers can achieve the tasks assigned to them within the constraints of strategic direction and self-measurement indices”. In fact, “successful companies in time to come will be those which can motivate employees to use their full talents for the firm,” observed Prof. Karla.HPM definedI remember a veteran trade unionist vehemently opposing the use of term “human resourcesas opposed to “human beings”. HPM definition offered by Prof. Satish Karla might be a consolation for him. “Human potential management is an integrative and continuous process of enhancing human capabilities and capacities by enriching human beings’ existing potential and helping them to discover and tap their latent potential through micro-level human development interventions and macro-level systems and policy interventions to create and sustain an environment.”As Prof. Kalra highlights, HPM has an underlying belief that if human beings are provided with opportunities to use their potential, they can manage themselves. This in a way is contrary to the belief system underlying HRM which says that human beings have to be managed (used) to achieve organisational objectives. He further differentiates HPM from HRM in several ways:• HPM does not use human beings as a resource, but recognises their potential and enables them to use their potential.• HPM is an integrative and continuous process of enhancing human capabilities and capacities. In this sense, it is different from HRM, which does not essentially see various interventions as integrative and as a whole the focus is on the use of human beings as a resource; therefore, most of the interventions are more often than not seen as strait-jacketed applications of HRM or HRD. In that sense, HRM has more of a “maintenance” kind of mindset, whereas HPM follows a continuous-growth-oriented approach.• HPM focuses more on turning employees’ potential to their own advantage, thereby leading automatically to the organisation’s advantage. In this sense, HPM underplays the organisation’s advantage by implying that if employees’ potential is taken care of, it is likely to enhance employees’ sense of responsibility towards organisations and create a feeling of organisational ownership (partnership), which could automatically lead to the achievement of organisationalobjectives/goals.• HPM also focuses on the continuous updating of organisational policies, structures and systems in such a way that it helps employees to achieve their full potential and to contribute their best to the organisation.From potential to possibilitiesDespite the wide popular use of HRM, the focus on human potential offers many prospects in unleashing the “people power”. As Prof. Jagdish Paarikh in his seminal book, “BeyondLeadership” highlights, such “people power” is manifested in obvious features of a human being. Our eyes can discriminate 8 million shades and our ears can discriminate 300,000 tonnes. We are blessed with a super-computer brain with immense observing, recording, analysing, recalling and strong capacity equivalent to thousands of contemporary mainframes. Beyond computing, it has almost immeasurable learning, understanding-imaging, creative, and intuitive abilities. The challenge is to use the human potential for the progress of people and institutions.Possibilities are immense when the unleashing of human potential systematically takes place. Imagination leading to innovation becomes inevitable. High-tech and high-touch harmony will also be possible with proper “paradox navigation”. With digital disruptions taking place, the demand for human creativity will be on the rise.Relevance to Sri LankaWhen we see many of our brilliant talented people excel as expatriates, unleashing of human potential at least overseas is visible. What barriers prevent us doing so in Sri Lanka? The choice of connections over the competencies has been a perennial issue in the local political arena.There are many instances when kith and kin of those who are at the helm appeared to be the favorites, with regard to filling the key positions. A strategic approach with a holistic perspective is required to have “paradox navigation” in ensuring proper “human potential management”.“One worthwhile task carried to a successful conclusion is worth half-a-hundred half-finished tasks”, said Malcolm S. Forbes. People need to be protected amidst a planetary pandemic, and that is where the proper paradox navigation is of paramount importance.What we require is clarity on strategy on one hand and the consistent continuity of execution on the other hand. People factor with proper leadership in action is key for such an endeavour. "

30 August 2020,Pioneer quartz manufacturer enters a new era,"Most developed countries have reached their present level of progress by increasing the value of their mineral resources.  Although Sri Lanka has no oil she is blessed with a variety of minerals including sand, graphite, lime, crystal stone, and clay used for producing ceramic.Above all, this island has been famous since ancient times for its precious stones. The country was known as the Island of Gems. If we maximise the use of all these resources the country would have already been developed.From Middle Eastern oil to iron in Great Britain, rich natural resources have been an essential precursor to wealth and economic growth worldwide. Considering this, it is unfortunate to see Sri Lanka’s massive wasted potential. This island is truly blessed with a wealth of precious minerals that we have failed to effectively monetise on the global market, greatly hampering our capacity for economic development. Looking from this perspective, quartz is undoubtedly one of Sri Lanka’s most important minerals. With diverse uses ranging from flooring to kitchen and bathroom countertops, its popularity on the global market by interior designers is unmatched.The global market for quartz countertops is currently valued at over $89 billion, with growth expected to be $110 billion by 2027. With Sri Lanka’s enormous natural supply of quartz, one would imagine that we are placed to strategically exploit this huge market. Instead, Sri Lanka continues to import a majority of its quartz. This is largely due to the fact that the majority of Sri Lanka’s quartz is exported in the form of quartz powder which is then converted into proper slabs in countries such as India and China, then sold to the global market including Sri Lanka at an inflated price. The export of quartz powder reduces the amount of value addition in Sri Lanka and creates much fewer jobs. It also effects Sri Lanka’s external balance by sending a high proportion of profits to overseas giants. Seeing the calamitous wasted potential, Ruhunu Lanka Minerals became the first Sri Lankan company to launch the manufacture of quartz slabs locally, under the brand ‘Crystal Stone’.Ruhunu Lanka Minerals is affiliated to the Hansagiri Group of Companies and is known for other nationally renowned businesses such as  Ruhunu Lanka Cement and Thilakma City.Crystal Stone was founded with the dream of sparking a globally competitive quartz manufacturing industry in Sri Lanka to tackle exploitation by global giants. Crystal Stone currently has customers ranging from the United States of America to Australia, with massive growth in only two years of activity.Managing Director of Ruhunu Lanka Minerals, Buddhika Kariyawasam, said,  “Sri Lankan quartz powder is currently exported for a measly Rs.30 while our finished Crystal Stone slabs easily command over Rs.150 on the world market”.This is a value addition of over 400%. Crystal Stone directly employs over a hundred workers and has created hundreds of jobs in indirect employment locally. This directly improves living standards in the community and doesn’t waste the potential of Sri Lanka’s skilled labour. Kariyawasam also stressed the importance of solidifying Sri Lanka’s position in the global market by exploiting the rampant trade wars and diplomatic flares between the West and China.He said, “Trump’s trade war with China has left many US importers of quartz products without their usual suppliers, and they are looking for alternatives. Sri Lanka’s stable diplomatic relations mean that we have a massive advantage when trading with the West as they can be assured of stable prices”.With this huge opportunity, Kariyawasam reminds that it is crucial for Sri Lankan manufacturing industries to weather the storm of Covid-19 so that it can reap huge economic rewards once global markets fully reopen. Among the ains of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s vision of a prosperous Sri Lanka is to boost local industries and make us a stronger global competitor. For this vision to be realised, local industries must be supported. Currently, Crystal Stone’s primary issue is significant foreign competition in the local market. While Crystal Stone slabs are of equal or better quality than foreign competition, the infrastructure advantage that Chinese and Indian manufacturers enjoy is significant.Kariyawasam said, “While we have invested in the best quality European machinery and highly trained workers, we are currently unable to enjoy the economies of scale that Chinese manufacturers enjoy after decades of protection and subsidisation from the Chinese government.”“Importers also exploit Sri Lankan value-based duties by significantly undervaluing their stock and also importing extremely low-quality products into the Sri Lankan market with unacceptable durability,” he said.It is sad to see anti-competitive behaviour of this nature taking place in the Sri Lankan market.Kariyawasam said that a per-kilo cess would be much more effective to reduce the effects of undervaluing goods. Crystal Stone also calls for a temporary ban on the import of quartz slabs to help establish the industry firmly in Sri Lanka.The Sri Lankan countertop market is currently heavily dependent on granite, a far inferior product to quartz in terms of quality. Crystal Stone slabs are waterproof, heat resistant, scratch and stain-resistant, and far more durable and easy to clean than granite. This is due to the engineered nature of the surface and the quality Sri Lankan 99.9 per cent pure crystal quartz.Kariyawasam said many Chinese manufacturers use very low-quality quartz powder to reduce costs, creating a far inferior product. Ultimately, the global shift towards products such as Crystal Stone is clear, with 87% of interior designers in a US survey opting for quartz countertops over granite. Crystal Stone products have a sleek, modern aesthetic and come in a range of colours and styles to suit everyone’s tastes. Crystal Stone is at heart a community-focused company. It’s primary factory is on a 22-acre plot of land in Ranthotuvila, Elpitiya, in the Southern Province.Painstaking efforts have been taken to build the factory in the midst of a large rubber plantation to ensure it causes no sound pollution and dust pollution to nearby communities.A complex rainwater recycling system also ensures that over 100,000 litres of water daily is recycled and reused in the production process. In sourcing pure quartz, Crystal Stone employs small scale methods where the crystal is mined by hand, significantly minimising damage to the environment. “Chinese and Indian quartz miners use large machinery that destroys the landscape and does irreversible damage to the environment,” said Kariyawasam. “Our method ensures that we run an environmentally sustainable operation”.The crystal powder that is a by-product of the Crystal Stone slabs is also used to make pebbles, known for their popularity as a home decoration. Crystal Stone employees are also exclusively hired by from local rural community and are given world-class training to ensure efficiency. Kariyawasam said that a motivated workforce is the keystone to a successful firm and strives to consistently improve staff welfare. Crystal Stone has demonstrated that it holds the recipe for international success, a high-quality product, sustainable manufacturing processes and access to a vast network of skilled labour and precious raw materials. It’s a call to action is that the government impose a six-month ban on quartz slab imports to help it weather the Covid-19 storm, allowing it to emerge a more serious global competitor with local market support in the near future.If Sri Lanka is to enjoy true economic prosperity, supporting local industries is essential and Crystal Stone embodies the spirited Sri Lankan innovation that must be embraced."
13 December 2020,Govt anticipates 5.5 percent growth rate next year – Ajith Nivard Cabraal,"State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms Ajith Nivard Cabraal said the Government in its Budget 2021 anticipates a 5.5 percent growth rate and perhaps even a higher rate next year. He said if we act together prudently, we can realise a growth even higher. Since we have got used to the Covid-19 situation, we will successfully deal with all areas next year to ensure a sound economic growth, he said.The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) parliamentarians are well aware that Budget 2021 will keep them in the Opposition for another 20 years. Naturally, they are upset. They preferred the Government to concentrate on minor issues so that it would be unpopular after some time. Unfortunately, the Government is concentrating on long term plans to provide solutions to people’s problems, the State Minister told the Sunday Observer yesterday.He said Budget 2021 has given immense relief to the people and really touched the people’s hearts. It is not like reducing the price of dhal by Rs.10 which is not a real relief. True benefit is such as when the former Mahinda Rajapaksa Government gave electricity to the people. When only 70 percent of the people had electricity, it was increased up to 99 percent. Therefore, 29 percent who didn’t have electricity are now enjoying the benefit. “SJB parliamentarians are making comments on the Budget due to their lack of knowledge of what the country really needs. They are listening to international agencies, the diaspora and those who write books on economic theories. They do not hear the farmers, the fishermen, small and medium sector industrialists, large scale industrialists and Stock Exchange investors. They are only interested in listening to foreign agencies which are not the grassroots relevant to the Budget,” he said. Cabraal said every single person they spoke to in the country said this Budget has delivered the goods for them. It has laid emphasis on 100,000 families looking for jobs for their children. At present, only 53 percent of the people have water in their homes. When we provide water connections to the remaining 47 percent, wouldn’t that be a huge relief to the people, he said.The State Minister said, when 100,000 kilometres of roads and 10,000 bridges are built, isn’t that a relief to the people? When people suffer from the human-elephant conflict, the Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa enjoys the company of the elephants. Does he realise that there are thousands of people affected by this conflict who need support urgently to make their lives better? It is not a priority for him. But, we think of the people and want to resolve the human-elephant conflict so that the people in those areas can live peacefully. Cabraal said the Government is setting up 1,000 national level schools. When people have a national level school in every Divisional Secretariat division, it would be a boon for them. It won’t matter to the SJB members, but it certainly is a benefit for the people. When university students demanded jobs at Lipton Circus, the Yahapalana Government gave them tear gas. When we give them jobs, and build highways and other roads, it is a true benefit for the people. This is what a country really needs, and that is what we would deliver through this Budget. "

2 May 2021,Foreign employment remittances should be protected,"Foreign exchange earnings through foreign employment is currently the largest source for remittances for Sri Lanka, approximately over US$ 7 billion, making an average contribution of 8.8% to the country’s Gross Domestic Product.  The Middle Eastern remittance corridor brings in approximately 60% of the total amount.The Trico Group of Companies, since 1978/79, has provided yeoman service to expat workers, predominantly in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), not only by carrying personal cargo safely but also assisting them in many other personal and delicate matters.In an interview with Sunday Observer Business, the Managing Director of the establishment, Gamini Kannangara, with over 35 years of hands-on experience in air and sea shipping operations, freight forwarding, warehousing, and land transport, outlines his views on present and future trends of the industry.Excerpts from the interview: Q. Can you briefly explain the history of your organisation and the present standing as a Sri Lanka-based international establishment?A. Trico’s shipping operations were launched humbly in 1978 in the United Kingdom by my brothers, Don Gazara, and the late Chandi Kannangara. At the initial stage in London, the demand for such service was created due to the opening of the Sri Lanka economy by the then J. R. Jayawardene Government in 1977. Cargo was collected and sent to Colombo by sea. Sensing a lucrative opportunity, they immediately branched out to Sri Lanka to handle its customer base.In 1982 Trico Sri Lanka opened its first Customs bonded warehouse and became a pioneer bonded operator to handle inbound personal effects shipments. As of today, over 700 direct and indirect workers are employed in our Sri Lanka operation. We have over 350 Sri Lankans and other nationalities employed in our branch offices in the Middle Eastern sector, covering almost all GCC countries and we have representations in over 35 countries throughout the world.Our direct and indirect total workforce and other service providers are over 5,000 personnel.  Also, through our Dubai Head office in the Middle East, we provide sea and air cargo services to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Nepal as three of our main destinations apart from Colombo. We yearly move substantial volumes of personal and general commercial cargo to and from these three countries.Q. Yours was an industry that had suffered a heavy blow  due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  How  did you manage the unanticipated crisis and keep the business afloat despite the loss of cargo movements from the Middle East and other countries?A. I was travelling in the Far East in February last year, before the pandemic first started spreading in Sri Lanka. I have been very closely monitoring the developments throughout the world as I was compelled to launch action to look after my staff in Sri Lanka and overseas. I returned to Sri Lanka at the end of February and negotiated with the Banks on a Plan B in the event Covid-19 hit hard.The banks agreed to our request of capital grace concessions to pay only the interest components of the facilities.  I downsized operating costs not only to keep the company going but also to keep up commitments of payments. such as staff salaries and creditors in Sri Lanka and overseas by assessing volume drop.Q. As an experienced businessman, do you think that the impact of your timely and robust decisions made on your operations has paid back?A. Certainly. For example, comparative year-on year-year (2019/20) we slashed cost by Rs 100 million in Sri Lanka.The saving to the business from March 2020 to March 2021 was over 100 million. That was possible due to certain downsizing, more concentration on cost-cutting, wastage management, and several other bold steps taken at the beginning of the pandemic. Basically we introduce a beggars budget and drop luxury living.  All action plans were put in place by the end of May 2020.Q. What do you think is the short and long-term impact to Sri Lanka due to the crisis?A. The logistics industry, particularly airlines and shipping lines, feels the first pinch in any type of a natural calamity as the entire world is heavily dependent on supply chains. Disruption can produce both short and long-term repercussions.For example, when the US financial markets crashed in 2008,  worldwide volumes drastically dropped, approximately by 60%, impacting the whole world. I was living in Dubai, a key hub in air and sea cargo movements at the time and witnessed how fast airports and seaports started drying out. That impact never fully recovered as at 2020.However, managing the economic impact of the new crisis is entirely up to the Government and other  authorities. Hence, the recovery of the economic impact in Sri Lanka will take a longer time, unless the Government makes bold decisions and initiates drastic action with a proper recovery plan. It’s a matter between the Government and the health sector in Sri Lanka. Q. What is your operational capacity at present? Has it fully recovered?A. Most of our overseas operations, mainly the Middle Eastern sector, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Nepal are back to normal due to the emergency methods adopted in their respective countries. In fact, we are doing better than the pre-Covid period in some destinations. The operations and cargo movements in and out of Sri Lanka stay stagnated at 50% (P/E)of the full capacity and will take further time to recover mainly due to the ongoing travel restrictions.Q. Trico is known as the pioneer bonded warehousing operator for unaccompanied personal cargo (UPB) in Sri Lanka and known to be leading in the industry. What is your assessment of the competition?A. We obtained our bonded warehouse licence in 1982. Since then we have been the leading solution provider for the unaccompanied personal baggage market. We can humbly declare that we remain in the same position even after 38 years. Certainly, as a battle-hardened businessman and administrator, I closely scrutinise the competition.  So far, however, we have not been confronted by a worthy opponent, specifically in the Gulf region which is our major contributor in business..Q. It is not easy to remain at the top for so long in business. What are the key attributes that consistently contribute to the success of Trico?A. First and foremost, it is the unquestionable service we provide. We have the largest bonded warehouse facility in the country. We also operate three bonded facilities in Sri Lanka - Colombo, Kurunegala and Galle. We have perhaps the most trained cadre in these locations to provide speedy service to customers.As explained earlier, we have our strongest presence in the GCC countries. Therefore, we can extend an unmatchable level of service in the sector. Also, our staff is not only trained but also is under specific instructions to assist any type of personal matter arising to them either in their respective work areas overseas or in Sri Lanka.Another strong reason for customers to keep patronising us is the relationship my brothers and I maintain with the grassroots.Q. Some people who recently arrived in Sri Lanka said that you were personally involved in many welfare activities in Dubai since the outbreak, assisting the needy. Please let our readers know what they were?A. Yes, I was fortunate to offer some help to some of the expats who were stranded in Dubai. I emptied our staff accommodation facility and provided shelter and food for more than 350 female workers from time to time. Most of them have lost their jobs and were trapped as Colombo Airport was closed. I am happy to announce that all of them are back in Sri Lanka as of now.Q. What are your business plans for the immediate future?A. Like any businessman, I am never out of expansion and diversification plans. However, I am holding them until the situation improves. My sincere wish is that this devastating Covid-19 issue disappears as early as possible allowing all Sri Lankans to get back to normal lives."

13 September 2020,Cost optimisation to survive and thrive,"The common reaction to the economic downturn is  reducing costs across the board. However, cutting costs without clear segmentation during an economic downtown is not the recipe for success.Cost adjustments do need to be made, but the goal should be to strike the right balance between targeted, sustainable and smart spending to fuel your organisation for growth. Initiate cost adjustments to streamline and simplify business operations.Concentrate your spending on areas of the business that drives the greatest value and differentiation. Think of your organisation as a living organism.You can trim the extra fat, but if you cut away at the essential parts of the business, performance will start to drop off. Having to make cost adjustments is not easy, but it may be necessary for your business to survive and thrive amidst and post-Covid-19.Is it ok to ignore costs when your business is riding high? Or should you wait until the signals are clear that demand has fallen and costs have escalated before you begin the necessary cost-optimisation initiatives to sustain performance?While cost optimisation should be a priority for all companies regardless of the economic cycle and should be a daily activity, the reality is that when times are good, it’s on the back burner, and during a downturn, it becomes critical.CyclicalThe other side of the story is that very same companies that had cut costs previously for various reasons allow fat to build in when the volume and profits grow. Basically, cost cutting in Sri Lankan companies has been cyclical. This is a major weakness of these companies. Should you wait until the ship is sinking before plugging your profit leaks?One of the first things that managers need to change when approaching cost optimisation is their mindset. It helps to think of cost-cutting in terms of a weight-loss program.You may temporarily lose weight on a crash diet and an aggressive workout schedule, but to maintain the right BMI overtime, you need to adopt a healthy lifestyle and diet over the long term – it should be a daily commitment.Similarly, only managers who take the time to examine the cost structure throughout their business and embed cost discipline within their organisation’s culture will see gains that can be sustained over the long term.It is not easy to compete in the market today. Sometimes it seems that a company gets one set of expenses under control, and in the meantime, another area of the company begins experiencing cost overruns. It is a never-ending battle to maintain company profitability.Easy optionsCompanies need more insight into what drives costs in their business to ensure that cost-cutting is targeted at the right places and that the success of cost management initiatives is properly measured.Companies often pick the easy options for cost initiatives, rather than the ones that will yield the most savings. While budget and headcount reductions provide short-term cost savings, reducing complexity and improving process efficiency can yield significant and lasting benefits, but only if they are conducted rigorously and continuously. Companies must also be prepared to adopt major changes to their business model to remain competitive.Every person in a company has a role in cost management regardless of the job level but these responsibilities are typically unclear in many organizations.A clear strategy and open communication are vital to the success of any corporate project, but even more so around cost-cutting initiatives, where employees understandably can feel threatened by change. As part of this holistic view of costs, managers need to take responsibility for change beyond their own department and employee rewards around cost incentives must align with the business strategy.At the end of the day, it is very important to understand the relationship between cost and value. The decisions that you make should take cost and value into consideration. If the value created by engaging in a specific activity is higher than the costs caused by that activity, it is advisable to engage in that activity. It is, however, never recommended to engage in an activity whose costs are higher than the value that will be created by that activity. It is a principle that should always be considered in all cost management decisions."

5 November 2017,Stock Market continues encouraging performance,"The Sri Lankan stock market has continued what has been an encouraging year in 2017, where both market indices continue to record positive returns. The Benchmark All Share Price Index (ASPI) has made a 2.78% gain in October alone and a 6.31% gain year-to-date, while the S&P SL 20 index, which features the CSE’s 20 largest and most liquid stocks has also improved consistently, making a 5.74% gain in October and a 11.50% gain since the start of 2017. The positive growth of the indices mark a reversal of the declining trend recorded in 2015 and 2016, during which the ASPI recorded a decline of 5.54% and 9.66% respectively.The performance of the market has also resulted in an improved involvement among investors, where the Daily Average Turnover is recorded at Rs. 943 million year-to-date, which is a 28% increase from Rs. 737 million in 2016.Commenting on market performance, CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike said “2017 has offered encouragement as far as market performance is concerned and investors are starting to recognize long term value in the market. The foreign activity we have witnessed indicates that international investors have been quick to identify an opportunity in Sri Lankan stocks, and with the macro-economic environment continuing to improve we hope to see further advances where secondary market activity is concerned, especially among local retail and institutional investors.”The significant amount of capital raised via rights issues during the year presents another standout feature, with the figure of Rs. 37 billion raised as of end October recording the highest yearly figure since 2007.This development continues to indicate the confidence placed by listed companies in the capital market when addressing their additional capital requirements.The market has also continued to attract foreign investment throughout 2017, with Rs. 98 billion in foreign buying contributing to a net foreign inflow of Rs. 19.6 billionyear-to-date, a figure that is substantial compared to foreign activity in 2015/16. 2017 also recorded an all-time high for foreign investor buying recorded in the first half of a calendar year.An attractive market valuation (P/E), encouraging performance among listed entities and capital gains tax exemptions offered to share transactions are considered to be defining factors in attracting the level of foreign investor interest the market has witnessed so far in 2017.In the midst of the growth of the indices and a number of other positives so far this year, the market continues to trade at a discount compared to regional peers and offers further opportunities for investors - with a market P/E recorded at 10.99 as of the end of October.The CSE through its market development activities has embarked on an awareness drive in 2017, reaching out to multiple investor segments around the country and in international markets.

9 February 2020,Restructure at the right time,"When the economy becomes unstable, small businesses often feel the effects first. Similarly, changes within a small business’s industry, like a new competitor or industry’s weaker demand, may cause its profits to decline. Small businesses have a tendency to make decisions for shorter terms; hence such companies generally don’t pay much attention to medium to long term risk aversion.When small organisations have depleted all their capacity in trying to resurrect operations, the next best thing is to re-structure the business fore revival and rejuvenation. To start on a new journey with a new successful restructuring and reorganization of an organization require good analysis of the challenges and to define the issue in context. Big or small as the businesses progress over time, there is a natural tendency to add complexity.If we put things in simple terms, then complexity does cost quite some money. Whether the organisational design and structure is complex, a product is complex and will offer a transactional process, the added cost of complexity shall also drag the performance a bit further.Whether it’s a public entity or private ownership, restructuring can be driven by a need for change in the organisational structure or business model of a company, or it can be driven by the necessity to make financial adjustments to its assets and liabilities. Frequently, it involves both.Companies restructure for a variety of reasons: Reduce the cost structure, concentrate on profitable market and product segments only, improve competitive advantage, spin off a subsidiary company, merge with another company, decrease or consolidate debt, or lay off excess employees for greater productivity.Many private owners are reluctant to restructure due to egoistic attitudes with the fear that they might be perceived as those who have failed. As opposed to this misconception, the decision to re-structure itself makes the business come out of a disaster which is a fact that has to be kept in mind. If you look around the world you would hardly find a large multinational who has not done re-structuring over the past 10 years. Look at the large local conglomerates; they too have done many.The good thing about the company restructuring plan is that the cost of operations could decrease in the future. An example can be used to explain this. The payroll expenses will be much lower if the businesses have dismissed some of the employees. Likewise, there are outsourced operations which are usually less expensive than those in-house labour.We live in an era of risk and instability. Globalisation, new technologies, and greater transparency have combined to upend the business environment and give many CEOs a deep sense of unease.And it has become virtually impossible for some executives even to clearly identify in what industry and with which companies they’re competing.All this uncertainty poses a tremendous challenge for strategy making. That’s because traditional approaches to strategy — though often seen as the answer to change and uncertainty — actually assume a relatively stable and predictable world.Think about it. The goal of most strategies is to build an enduring (and implicitly static) competitive advantage by establishing clever market positioning (dominant scale or an attractive niche) or assembling the right capabilities and competencies for making or delivering an offering (doing what the company does well).Companies undertake periodic strategy reviews and set direction and organisational structure on the basis of an analysis of their industry and some forecast of how it will evolve.To adapt, a company must have its antennae tuned to signals of change from the external environment, decode them, and quickly act to refine or reinvent its business model and even reshape the information landscape of its industry. "

9 February 2020,"Israel back in business, says he’s grateful to new employer","London: Israel Folau says he is “grateful” to be at Super League outfit Catalans Dragons as the competition’s clubs held talks on Wednesday over the controversial signing of the dual-code international.The French rugby league club have been heavily criticised for signing the 30-year-old, who was sacked last year by Australian rugby union chiefs over his highly publicised homophobic views.Folau, who arrived in Perpignan at the weekend to begin training with his new teammates ahead of Sunday’s round two fixture at Wakefield, said he was raring to get started.“I’m excited to be back playing the game that I grew up playing,” Folau said.The other clubs had specifically requested the presence of Guasch after he ignored the will of both Super League and the Rugby Football League in signing Folau.Hull KR chairman Neil Hudgell wrote a letter to the Dragons warning them of possible legal consequences in the event of his club losing out financially due to the presence in Super League of Folau.Guasch, who has defended his club’s decision to hand Folau a 12-month contract, was expected to attend the regular meeting but had not arrived when it got under way at 1000GMT. "
6 December 2020,Bracing for the immediate future,"The retail industry in Sri Lanka which contributes 34% to the GDP and employs 14% of the total labourforce, has been severely affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The industry comprising small boutiques to large retail chains suffered an immense blow at the first emergence of the virus. However, despite expert opinion that the retail businesses will suffer long term effects, Sri Lanka rebounded much faster than many other countries.The retail business was on the verge of full recovery when the second wave surfaced without warning. The momentum of business recovery was abruptly halted with a heavy spike of infected cases, a growing number of deaths, renewed severe warnings, and lockdowns.This time around, the effect is exceedingly severe on small scale retail businesses, particularly in affected remote areas. Nevertheless, most of the large players such as retail products manufacturers and supermarket chains are able to weather the storm somewhat effectively.Thousands of jobs are at a risk adding a new challenge to the economy as individual incomes are severely compromised. Being a lower-middle-income country, the government has limitations in providing adequate monetary assistance to the affected families, although a creditable attempt is being made.Retailers already missed one out of the two best seasons of retail business in April with the total lockdown prevailed.Regrettably, they are on the threshold of missing the second such season in December. However, as the curfew is only imposed in a few areas, retailers in other areas have an opportunity of facing up the challenge to extract the best.The brick-and-mortar business must go on irrespective of whatever the hardships exist for the benefit of the economy, customers, and the individual owners.Fight or perishThings are not going on well for the retail trade. Businesses have two options; fight or perish. Either you can run to a bunker and hide or face up the challenge by innovating, adjusting, and being creative. Let us explore what retailers can do to change the tide and achieve the best outcome, despite the grueling situation.Retailers dealing predominantly with ‘consumer packaged goods’ (CPG), also known as ‘fast-moving consumer goods’ (FMCG) must first understand the effects of the anticipated promotions in any form and any method.The retailer also must know the difference between promotional and baseline sales. Successful companies use the ‘sales lift metric’ to measure the change.Specifically, ‘buyer test’ with a short-term promotional campaign, both online and offline, is recommended to gather insights on the audience and the buyers. Through the method, the retailer can assess the impact on the target anticipated audience.During the oncoming season, you can take your store on the road by organising onsite promotions. If adequate space is available, the best way to attract customer attention is to set up a pop-up store to display the best and most economical products.Naturally, however, better results can be achieved if you have an opportunity of setting up such pop-up stores in places outside the store such as events, fairs and, or conventions in the area. Even if the retailer has to incur some costs, the effort will undoubtedly increase foot traffic, awareness, and revenue.Package dealBundling the merchandise and offering as a package deal is a good and simple method to increase sales. Any retailer can offer an attractive collective price for an array of items. This method is successful in many of the retail products, specifically groceries and garments.This can be a better method than even offering a storewide discount. Also, the retailer can offer several packages in different items. However, the bundle must be genuinely priced as the customers tend to check the cumulative value, often before the purchase. It may be a good idea to add-up some seasonal merchandise to your stock as in-store promotional items as we are approaching the Christmas season.Irrespective of the product segments you have in the store currently, putting in supplementary seasonal products is an effective way of attracting additional foot traffic to the store that finally will increase revenue. Introducing complementary low-priced products that can draw the attention of the passers-by is an effective strategy.When you are a retailer, understanding the shelf arrangement is immensely useful. When the customers visit the store, usually they have an insufficient idea about the placements of products on the shelves.Therefore, shelf designing and arrangements of the store are one of the key elements of the in-store display, irrespective of whether it is a large or small floor area. A carefully planned strategy must be available, in advance for the display composition.For example, the best-selling products must be exhibited near the entrance for customers to see them as they enter. This not only draws the immediate attention of the visitor but also enhances the general opinion providing a psychological advantage.Placing merchandise in group-related items in the same section, keeping fastest moving products at eye level, and placing the low priced items near the cashier counters are some of the arrangements the store can use.Window displayThe retailer hopes to attract the attention of every passer-by even if they do not visit your store at the first instance. A well-planned window display will do that for you without much cost if you are passably creative.Window displays were used throughout history successfully as a sales tactic and are still being used by almost every successful retailer, particularly in the festive seasons. Proper and creatively arranged displays not only draw more visitors but also provide higher credibility to the store. You can use various types of displays such as typography, décor elements, and related messages to make the store look super appealing.Offering something extra, probably samples of small inexpensive gifts with the purchase can be an attractive approach to increase sales. By going the extra mile, the store becomes personal to the customer even if the added free item is a token or a symbol. Freebies are appreciated and admired anywhere in the world and it not only draws appreciation but also chances of repeat visits of the customer are guaranteed as well. Partnering with other non-competitive and fitting establishments with mutual exchanges to offer gifts can be done. If you search enough, you may find many such entities that are looking to co-exist.Being customer-centric is the key to the survival, sustainability, and growth of any type of business in good times and bad. This is more so in retail trade where the customers are engaged exceedingly closely. The staff of retail trade must be trained adequately in enhanced service delivery including exact job role, the sales pitch to be deployed effectively, non-communication techniques, and so forth. Especially, in these Covid-19 related troubled times, retailers must be more aware that it’s all about customers as customers tend to move away and rely more on online purchases.‘Must-visit’Make your retail store to be a destination during the oncoming season and make it a ‘must-visit’ store in your area by improvising simple but creative arrangements and adjustments. Eye-catching product placements, additional lighting, instrumental music, and good smelling air-fresheners are a few of them to make your store a pleasant place for visitors.Finally, retailers must strictly adapt to the health and safety regulations recommended by the health authorities. These guidelines mainly include wearing masks, ensuring physical distance, controlling the number of visitors inside the store, facilities to wash hands, and making hand sanitizers accessible easily.However, within the health parameters, retailers should understand that customers visit brick and mortar to have a physical experience, and connecting with potential customers on a human-to-human level is also of utmost importance.As retailers, you must understand a simple reality. The expectation that the business will return to ‘normal’ has to be stopped. The various vaccines that are being developed worldwide will take time to roll-out. Even when they are ready to be distributed, the ground reality is that it will take a considerable time to reach Sri Lanka. By the time the vaccines reach the country the retail business would have missed more best-selling seasons. Hence, better to be ready to face the challenges that lie ahead, head on by preparing yourself and your store right away. "
25 July 2021,Competencies sans connections vital,"Results can be delivered only when the right person is handling the right job. This is possible only when competencies are considered in hiring and not connections. Various stories we hear in the private and public sectors highlight the clarity needed in ensuring the right set of competencies. Let’s discover this further in today’s column. Overview The choice of connections over competencies has been a perennial issue in the global political arena.  The kith and kin of those who are at the helm appear to be the favourites, with regard to filling key positions. It is easy to promise but difficult to practice, based on the many stories we hear. As the Indian media reported a few years ago, the inaugural Modi government in its very first order, issued on the day he was sworn in prime minister, had barred ministers from handpicking “personal staff”. This was  unprecedented and showed Modi’s intent to ensure that none of his ministers fancies a “hidden agenda”.No one, not even Indira Gandhi, went to this extent to keep a check on ministers from overstepping their briefs. It was also supposed to bring an end to the “appointment” of family members as personal staff, which had been a practice with many ministers over the years. Whether the same ethos remain today is worth exploring. Can we say the same thing about Sri Lanka? I will leave it to the readers to judge. One thing is clear in no uncertain terms. A significant section of society is looking forward to professionalism at all key levels, as a vital part of “exemplary” governance. Competency canvassThe word ‘canvass’ has many meanings assigned to it, according to any typical dictionary. I would go by the idea that it is a “large piece of fabric (usually canvas fabric) by means of which wind is used to propel a sailing vessel”. In other words, something that propels in giving direction and protects in guarding against outside forces.Components of competencyCompetencies are the measurable or observable knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviour critical to successful job performance. It begins with attitude and then comes aptitude which can be further subdivided into knowledge and skills. In other words, these three form the three main compartments in the competency canvass. Let’s discuss them in detail.Attitudinal component of competency This in fact is the most complex, and most crucial component. Some authors simplify things in calling the three components of competency as knowledge, skills, and attitude (KSA), in highlighting the behavioural aspects as the attitude. According to Hogg & Vaughan (2005), an attitude is “a relatively enduring organisation of beliefs, feelings, and behavioral tendencies towards socially significant objects, groups, events or symbols. It has a heavy behavioural component. Interestingly, there is a model that combines the behavioural aspect with others. It is called the ABC of an attitude.Affective component: this involves a person’s feelings or emotions about the attitude object. For example: “I am scared of spiders”.Behavioral (or cognitive) component: the way the attitude we have influences how we act or behave. For example: “I will avoid spiders and scream if I see one”.Cognitive component: this involves a person’s belief or knowledge about an attitude object. For example: “I believe spiders are dangerous.”Types of behaviour are typically evaluated in terms of consistent adherence to a set of behavioral standards. Examples of behavioral competencies and associated standards include:Customer focusBuilds and maintains customer satisfaction with the products and services offered by the organisation.Focuses on the customer’s business results, rather than one’s own.Seeks customer feedback and ensures needs have been fully met.Delivers products and services when and where the customer needs them.Explores options when unable to deliver a requested product or service and pursues solutions until the customer is satisfied.Business alignmentAligns the direction, products, services, and performance of a business line with the rest of the organisation.Integrates executive direction into every decision and consultation.Seeks to understand other programs in the department, including their services, deliverables, and measures.Advocates for and positively represents other programs and services when working with customers and stakeholders.Knowledge component of competencyKnowledge essentially refers to the understanding of a particular subject. It includes information acquired through experience or education. It also refers to the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. In other words, knowledge is what is known in a particular field or in total, facts and information.Ikujiro Nonaka, a veteran researcher of knowledge management, describes two types of knowledge - tacit and explicit. Let’s start with the easily seen one. Explicitness is also known as coded knowledge.It is the one which is available in soft and hard forms in textbooks, manuals, CDs etc. It is easily communicated and shared, as in product specifications, a scientific formula or a computer program.Tacit knowledge is based on personal experience. It is hard to explain and, therefore, difficult to communicate to others. It could be a craft or profession, a particular technology or product market, or the activities of a work group or team. As tacit knowledge is within individuals, the challenge is how to capture individual-based knowledge to make it explicit and common knowledge for use across the entire organisation.We have many examples of tacit knowledge getting trapped without being properly translated. Take the case of an indigenous physician. He might touch a patient and heal. Whereas the “golaya” (student) might be taking notes of his teacher’s behaviour and trying to learn which may be not fully successful. Why some of the ancient technologies used to construct stupas, dagobas, tanks and canals are not available now could be easily attributable to non-transferring the tacit knowledge of our ancient forefathers to a coded form.  Skills component of competencyEven in a corporate scenario, resigning of a well-experienced manager might create a dearth of knowledge unless a proper plan is in place to ensure translation of at least some of his/her tacit knowledge to his/her successor. This can be a critical knowledge challenge in order to ensure business continuity.  A skill or ability refers to a natural or learned capacity to perform an act. A skill is also, the learned capacity to carry out pre-determined results often with the minimum outlay of time, energy, or both. It was Robert Katz (1974) who classified management skills as technical, human and conceptual. Technical Skills pertain to what is done and to working with things. They comprise a person’s ability to use technology to perform an organisational task. An engineer using his/her engineering expertise is one such example. Human Skills refer to how something is done and to working with people. They comprise a person’s ability to work with people in the achievement of goals. An engineer using his/her persuasion skills in motivating his/her team is an example. Essentially they refer to interpersonal relations. Conceptual Skills involve why something is done and to a person’s view of the organisation as a whole. They comprise the ability to understand the complexities of the organisation as it affects and is affected by its environment. These can be defined as the ability to coordinate and integrate the organisation’s diverse activities and are most important at the top of the organisational hierarchy where strategic or long-term decisions are made.Uses of competencies Competencies offer a variety of uses in getting the best out of employees. Several such specific uses are listed below: In developing job descriptions with clear identification of knowledge, skills and behavioural requirements In recruitment and selection.  where proper assessment of the candidate is required In employee performance management, where objective evaluation is essential In training and development,  where identified competency gaps should be filled In career and succession planning, where required competencies at next level should be identified  In compensation, where due recognition should be involved with competency-based pay One may think that it is all in the HR domain. Yet, the fact remains that every functional manager has to work with people and hence their competencies are of high importance.Way forwardCompetency canvass assists us in clearly identifying the components of a competency with the associated components. Sri Lankan managers have to be more objective in clearly identifying the required competencies of their team members. Else, it will be a case of rushing to deciding on people based on mere opinions. Sri Lankan organisations can enhance their hiring professionalism by way of ensuring the preference of competencies over competencies. It will pave the way not only for higher organisational performance but also for better employee satisfaction. Even at the national level, the key challenge of picking the right person to handle the right job can be meaningfully handled by adhering to some of the fundamentals of Human Resource Management. When it takes place, competencies will definitely be more significant than connections. "
8 March 2020,‘Entrepreneurship culture vital to drive growth’,"The business community is prepared to extend its support and expertise in taking Sri Lanka to the next level of development. Therefore, it is important to promote an entrepreneurship culture with a positive mindset to drive growth, Chairman and Managing Director, Russel’s (Pvt) Ltd., Russel Perera said.“We must not lose confidence. Everyone should work for the betterment of the country. In this journey, a collective effort without any division is essential and we need to make use of the windows of opportunity that is presented in today’s context,” he said.There are more opportunities for the youth to engage in income generating avenues at present. It is necessary to look for new business ideas in keeping with the present trend. The use of modern technology should be looked at seriously to competitively meet the demands of the world today.An entrepreneur culture will have far reaching benefits and out of the box thinking will generate more employment for the country as well as value creation which will have multiple benefits for every strata of the society.Entrepreneurship is the process of designing, launching and running a new business, which initially is often a small business. Entrepreneurship has been described as the “capacity and willingness to develop, organise and manage a business venture along with any of its risks to make a profit”. Russel Perera understands this and he has set a benchmark for his venture.Having embarked on a revolutionary business concept and process Perera has been the pioneer in the out-sourcing of the serving of tea. Russel’s (Pvt) Limited has been successful in gaining a name that is synonymous with quality in every sphere of the businesses it focuses on. The company has grown from a tea serving business to become a diversified entity. Its businesses range from the supply of high grown tea and outdoor catering to fashion and design expertise.Russel’s has an impeccable record of over 32 years in service excellence as a tea supplier to the local market and has gained recognition as one of Sri Lanka’s most reputed organisations today. Having started operations in 1988 with a workforce of 25 people, the company considers its well-trained team of over 200 employees as its biggest strength.“We envisage a future where we will ultimately be involved in taking this country to much greater heights. Diversification plays a key role in our strategy to tackle and capitalise on the many challenges which come our way. We march forward together with resilience to take on new ventures and convert them in to something that benefits us as an organisation and society as a whole.“Our superior service range goes beyond tea and into catering as well. We are recognised for our flavour and exquisite taste among our clientele in Sri Lanka. Russel’s catering service, backed by its loyal, skilled and professional staff handle varied catering events.Being a strong believer in business diversity, in 2000, we extended our reach to the apparel industry with the production of high quality garments under a new division, Russel’s Fashion and Design (Pvt) Limited with the signature brand St. Francis. The new feature of Russel’s garment industry, is the SF clothing online store which offers the latest in fashion in casual wear for ladies”.Russel’s aims to be the country’s leading F&B service provider whilst diversifying and creating household brands as well as the country’s highest paid employer empowering employees who in turn takes the best care of the customers. A significant portion of the income generated is diverted into the business mainly for the benefit of the staff. The company conducts continuous training sessions and rewarding initiatives to recognise and motivate staff in bringing out the best in them. This has resulted zero employee turnaround and the first two employees (rom the inception) are still a part of Russel’s team. Having grown from a small outlet to an entity with a highly trained workforce extending service to multiple organisations across the nation, the secret behind Russel’s tasty cup of tea is the comprehensive training that ensures no compromise in quality at any company where they handle the serving of tea.Having made a name in the market of Sri Lanka, especially in the tea industry, Russel’s Group has a promising future under the guidance of the Founder and with support from his wife Bernie and two sons Jehan and Rashen. "
10 January 2021,Effectiveness of promoting ‘intrapreneurship’   ,"‘Entrepreneur’ is the term most of us are familiar with concerning the concept of entrepreneurship or ownership of a business entity.  It is known that entrepreneurship is challenging with many responsibilities that predominantly runs along with dedication, commitment, and relentless hard work. In contrast, ‘intrapreneurship’ is the system where the principles of entrepreneurship are practiced by the staff, often senior members, in a company.These senior members of the organisation take on the responsibility of developing products, services, or processes of the company by innovating new ideas and methods.  In short, they act as entrepreneurs inside the boundaries of the company. According to Wikipedia, Gifford Pinchot III, the legendary American entrepreneur, author, and inventor, defines intrapreneurs as those who are responsible for creating innovations of any kind within an organisation. The term was acknowledged by “The American Heritage Dictionary’ to mean the new word as a person within a large organisation who takes the responsibility of turning an idea into a profitable product or service through assertive risk-taking and innovation. Since then many ideas on the subject were published to improve the concept with introductions of several similar definitions.Intrapreneurship allows an employee of a business organisation to act as an entrepreneur in selected areas. Similar to entrepreneurs, the intrapreneur is a self-motivated, proactive, and innovative individual who takes the initiative to pursue to improve the success of a product or service.The main difference between the two concepts is that the intrapreneur does not have a personal cost in case of a failure as it does for the entrepreneur.  Intrapreneurship creates an environment to allow the employees to think like entrepreneurs and encourage them to use their independent skills for the benefit of the company. They are allowed the required freedom to experiment. Also, the opportunity given by the company gives them an opening to grow within the organisation. Intrapreneurship encourages independence. It enhances the commitment of the worker with more creativity and commitment.The biggest challenge for entrepreneurs is to identify employees who can be groomed to be assigned the tasks of an intrapreneur without taking risks. Recognising such employees from the cadre with an entrepreneurial spirit can be a delicate process due to possible negative impact that may arise if a wrong choice is made. The concept of developing intrapreneurs is not without adverse effects as well. The main among them is the possibility of an employee leaving the organisation and competing in the same market. Nevertheless, employers who support and promote intrapreneurship tend to benefit more than those who do not. The employees, who are suitable for intrapreneurship generally, display qualities such as confidence, ambition, and goal-oriented. They are self-starters and individuals with multi-tasking capabilities.  Entrepreneurs are usually possessing higher levels of skills compared to average employees. They also have the capacity to resolve specific issues and show higher levels of leadership skills and assertiveness. They are not afraid to test ideas to achieve an identified target or goal. They can identify market trends and conditions to think outside the box to generate results.  If practiced consistently, the concept can be crucially important to long-term sustainability. According to Deloitte, one of the ‘Big Four’ accounting firms, and the largest multinational professional services network, 88% of Fortune 500 companies do not exist anymore. They may have run out of innovative ideas that are usually limited to either the ownership or the top management. Typically, large companies, after a successful run for many years, struggle with fresh business ideas due to complacency, less entrepreneurship, and the diminished interest of employees. Unless the employers encourage them to think out of the box and come out with innovative ideas,  complacency can prevail. Companies usually get comfortable with past successes and pay less attention to competitive market conditions.  Without creative innovations, they can go out of business eventually. Hence, developing intrapreneurship is one model that can prevent such possible occurrences.    A person does not have to own the business to be an entrepreneur. It is the individual mindset that is important. Many people with such mental abilities and skills are awaiting an opportunity. Nevertheless, some of them never run their own due to a lack of resources and various factors. A smart entrepreneur can identify such people and groom them to be assets and integral parts of the development of the business. Employees with an entrepreneurial attitude are generally different from others. During my near forty-year career in the private sector, I have come across people with exactly what we discussed here concerning intrapreneurship. I have witnessed some of them rising through the ranks rapidly to reach the top-notch. Therefore, if a company wants to create an environment to nurture such assets, they should attempt to manage and guide them appropriately. Hence, let us examine how to lead and manage possible entrepreneurs in an organisation. Keeping the rules and guidelines at reachable and minimum levels is helpful. Simple guidelines can help the chosen employees to operate better with a stress-free mindset. With easy rules, instinctively they will evaluate the situation and solve problems for the companyMeanwhile, the company must allow them the freedom to challenge a situation, issue, development, or any other growth-related scenario. A good intrapreneur is not a ‘yes man’ who will accept things without evaluating them. If they challenge, they do not mean harm but seek ways to find better answers.  Your employees whom you have selected to be intrapreneurs are habitual with outstanding characters, traits, and skills. Therefore, they will be happier if you give them more problems to solve without taking on such problems on your own. Turn them loose and watch the results and perhaps they will surprise you. However, if you feel that they are not on track, subtly pull them back to the correct path. Intrapreneurial employees are dreamers most often. They like to dream up ideas or help others to develop ideas. In both ways, the employer wants new, stimulating, and innovative things to happen continuously in the company that will possibly assist the growth. As a business owner, you will constantly need new ideas for your products or services. Therefore, you must help them bring new ideas to be successfully completed.  The intrapreneurs in the company will admire the freedom to work more than the others. They may not like to abide by too many rules. Therefore, the company must find a suitable method to offer more autonomy to them without breaking or bending common regulations, taking into consideration that other employees follow existing rules and regulations. You must let them concentrate on the mission they are assigned and they will do everything to produce results.  Providing these employees a real sense of purpose and accepting failures are salient factors. The entrepreneur should share the actual purpose of the organisation, entrepreneurial vision to help them to feel that they are not just following but contributing to the purpose. They will honestly feel that they are on a meaningful journey with the company. However, the calculated failures should be consented to encourage them.  By accepting and practicing the concept of intrapreneurship, the business can build a company of leaders. Leadership is not a legitimate title but a tool to keep the sustainability and growth of the company intact. Therefore, more leaders who act as entrepreneurs in the company contribute immensely to the long-term existence of an organisation.When an employee believes that their voice is heard and accepted as an intrapreneur within the organisation, they undoubtedly will make the best effort to contribute more.    "
15 December 2019,Getting started in shares - Part 6 (Courtesy the Colombo Stock Exchange) : Buying and selling shares on the CSE,"Only a licensed Stockbroker can execute transactions on behalf of investors in return for a service fee (brokerage) which provides investors with a secure and well regulated trading environment.Services offered by a broker firm would defer from one to the other and as stressed previously, needs to be selected carefully. Other services may include providing research documents which the research team of the particular firm has conducted on the market or individual companies, to provide investors with the information needed to make an informed investment decisions.Instances at which shares become available for purchase by investors as detailed below:Trading in the primary market from a new issue of shares/Initial Public Offering (IPO)A company which is seeking equity capital can do so by issuing shares to the general public using the platform provided by the Colombo Stock Exchange. This new issue of shares is referred to as an Initial Public Offer (IPO).The first step of this process is to submit an initial listing application to the CSE which is evaluated and approved. Subsequently a prospectus which has been approved by the CSE is lodged with the Registrar of Companies in Sri Lanka by the issuing company. After the prospectus is lodged and registered it can then be provided to potential investors for their consideration.Companies typically use a combination of broking firms, licensed commercial banks and investment banks which advise the company on the IPO, to promote the sale of new shares and distribute the prospectus to potential investors. The CSE website also makes available details on upcoming IPO’s and would host the prospectus and application form.To buy shares: If you wish to buy shares in an IPO, you should first review the prospectus carefully. It would provide you with an in-depth understanding about the company, the industry trends, the manner in which the IPO is structured and salient details of the shares, risks attached, financial statements of the company and other disclosures which are required by law.You will need to open a CDS account through a stockbroker / custodian bank (if you do not have one already) prior to applying for the IPO. A CDS account is required because the CSE’s trading system is fully automated and the paper securities (Share Certificates / Debenture Certificates) should be lodged in the CDS account and translated into an electronic form in order to be traded at the CSE.(When investors buy securities, the account is automatically credited with the securities purchased and the corresponding seller’s account is automatically debited with the same amount.)After you are comfortable about investing, fill out the application form specifying all requisite details including the number of shares you wish to buy and send it to the collection points specified in the Prospectus (usually stockbrokers, the company’s main office or branches and/or branches of specified banks), before the application deadline.To sell shares: once new shares are issued and listed on the CSE, they may trade at a market price substantially different from the issue price (either higher or lower). This is due to supply and demand for the shares of the company. You will need to instruct your Stockbroker to sell your shares in the secondary market.Trading in the secondary marketShares can be bought on the secondary market on any trading day by placing a purchase order through a Stockbroker. A secondary market is one in which an investor could either buy or sell shares or other securities from or to another investor, subsequent to the original issuance in the primary market.As we discussed before, the advantage of investing in existing shares are their liquidity. On any trading day, prices at which investors are willing to buy and sell shares (bids and offers) are available for the majority of listed companies.However, you must note that different shares have different liquidity levels. Some companies may have very few buyers and/or sellers on any given trading day. Liquidity is an important consideration as it affects the price you might have to pay and the ease in which you can sell your investment.To trade on the secondary market you must first contact a stockbroker /custodian bank and open a CDS account through them. After a CDS account number has been obtained, to buy or sell shares traded on the CSE, your order must be placed with a stockbroker, typically over the telephone, by fax, visiting or online.Internet tradingInternet trading facilities are available through select stockbrokers. Online trading provides individual investors with around-the-clock access to the trading system along with market data, company information and educational material. It simplifies the trading process by empowering investors to secure the decision-making power and trade independently.To be continued "
27 June 2021,Finding the right staff for business success,"The great American business magnate, industrial designer, and investor Steve Jobs said, “It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do”. Every businessman knows that people are the biggest asset in an organisation. Their individual conduct, commitment, and loyalty make way for the success or failure of a business. This is the reason for companies to pay maximum attention to hire the best and attempt to retain good employees. Hiring for employment not only is a tedious process but also one of the deciding factors of business success. As Steve Jobs says, recruiting smart people with imagination who can tell the organisation what to do to grow can influence the entire process in a business.At its core, recruiting seems like a simple concept where candidates are identified and sent through an interview process and finally hire them. However, factually, effective recruiting is art on one hand and science on the other. Recruitment requires the implementation of repeatable processes that leads to consistent results and also requires creative thinking to find the most ideal candidate.  Not an easy taskIn my career spanning nearly forty years in over twenty different organisations, I have interviewed hundreds of candidates for various jobs and I have experienced both successes and failures in those recruitments. Usually, in recruitment, within a very short time, the recruiter has to make a judgment about another human being, considering multiple factors. This is not an easy task under any circumstance. During my tenure of service in the private sector, I have come across a variety of applicants with diverse ambitions, needs, aspirations. Over the years, I have interviewed over-reacting candidates, overconfident candidates, desperate people, and aggressive candidates. There are many other types of candidates with varied personal characteristics. Recruiting the deal candidate by analysing these personal traits in a jiffy is not a simple task by any means. Due to the ongoing gruesome pandemic, recruitment has become a buyer’s market the world over. The inflow of applications has tremendously increased during the past year due to job losses experienced due to Covid-19. This dearth of supply over demand has posed an unanticipated challenge to recruiters. When many people apply for one job, the selection process becomes more complex for the hiring managers. In this scenario, the sorting out is more time-consuming, selecting applications to proceed further becomes mind-numbing and engagement in the process becomes more tiring. Recruiters often are put through loads of information at the initial stage of the hiring process. They have to analyse job applications, cover letters, credentials, and authentication of previous experiences. During this prolonged experience, one of the trickiest tasks is to determine whether the information provided by the candidates is genuine and factual. Historically, job applicants are not always honest or truthful as they have the opportunity to present themselves as they want to be seen by the recruiter.  Starting from educational qualifications, a candidate can churn out false or misleading information on work experience, extra activities, previous salary details, or even skills in their respective resumes. Reading through many applications to determine the authenticity of all these criteria can be exhausting.  Hence, better-organised companies send the selected candidates through a more organised screening process through skill tests and sample work assignments to get a sense of the true capability of the candidate.  Bullet pointsHowever, skills, experience, or education are not the only criteria for a good candidate. Metrics of experience, subject knowledge, or job-related qualifications are the bullet points that usually attract the employer or the hiring manager. Suitability to the organisation’s culture, team spirit and cohesiveness, willingness to learn, and more importantly the commitment to the job task are also enormously vital characteristics of a successful candidate. The employment application of the candidate and perhaps the cover letter are the two documents any employer receives at the start. A recruiter usually gets two types of applications. The first and the most attention-grabbing is the person with an impeccable record with good recommendations and a flawless resume. The second is an average person who has general education, mixed skills, and average experience.  Whom will you recruit?   The first mental reaction is to settle on the perfect candidate on paper. I repeat, on ‘paper’ because the paper can be deceiving when it comes to human behaviour which is a more important attribute in a candidate. There can be a better chance with the person who had to battle against odds to become successful may be a better choice than the person who had been ‘engineered’ throughout life towards success. Therefore, expanding the definition of the applicant is vitally important when identifying the right person for the job.  The two commonest aspects the employers consider when recruiting are the competency and the character of the candidate. Whilst both aspects are equally important to an employee, measuring these personal features is not easy. Job smartness is not exactly useful if the employee is not fitting into the organisation as a team member.  In fact, unfitting employees can create havoc by failing to bond with others in the organisation that can create a chain reaction of animosity. The competency can easily be identified (although the proof of application takes time) but the character of a person cannot be fathomed that easily.    Cautious Recruiting employees for startups or small business owners is an extremely important move. Even if the new business owner himself is experienced as an employee, deciding on new employees for his own business can be a make-or-break move. If such an entrepreneur employs a wrong candidate and his or her presence is short, the new business loses money from the capital by way of salaries. Therefore, invariably, new entrepreneurs have to be very cautious in hiring new employees.    During my career, time and again I have come across candidates who have presented phony details about important personal information. Therefore, my advice to any employer is to be thorough in background checks of any candidate before the final decision. As described earlier, job seekers tend to produce fake information to get the job.In my opinion, a reference from the last employer is a must for a candidate. Certainly, a disgruntled former employer can willfully offer a malicious opinion on a candidate. Nevertheless, the view of the previous employer can be extremely useful. It is up to the recruiter to weigh and verify such claims before making a decision. Personal and professional references are important to decide on employment although the professional view from a referee is more credible. Usually, personal references are pre-arranged and almost 100% of their estimation of an applicant is positive and favourable whilst a professional referee is more rational with their opinions.      Finally, learning how to hire efficient and loyal staff members is far beyond the mere comparison of candidates. The hiring process in any size of a business entails preparation and precision in analysis in personal behaviour and job-related skills. Recruiting is not only allowing someone to succeed but also allowing them to be an integral part of the business in the long run. Therefore, taking time for recruitment is well worth it for the recruiter to find the right candidate."
16 August 2020,"‘Cold calling’,  essential to boost sales","Cold calling, one of the most important early-stage elements in the sales process is positioned as a pivotal criterion that places a salesman as an interpreter, advisor, and a problem solver to a prospective customer.Selling is one of the oldest recorded professions that has witnessed numerous developments throughout human history. Since the introduction of ‘Science of Selling’ in the 1920s by Ford Motor Company, modern selling techniques have been developed and currently recognised as an art as well. Many people engaged in selling professionally, have attempted to create techniques for cold calling or cold canvassing in the sales process. Cold calling typically refers to the first unannounced contact made by a salesperson to a prospective customer. In the modern era, cold calling is face to face without an appointment, traditional door-knocking (door-to-door selling), or telephone canvassing.If viewed as negative or passive, cold calling can be a daunting task; this is a numbers game where you keep canvassing prospects without knowing whether a need exists or that the prospect is financially capable of buying your product or service. This is no different from a junk mail leaflet where you have no idea whether someone might respond.However, if and when a salesman views positively, cold calling has immense potential, probably more than many other lead generation techniques. By engaging in cold canvassing the salesman supersedes existing suppliers and preempts the competition. Cold selling can also identify and create numerous new business opportunities. This can establish many relationships as the salesman personally is present at the location with the prospect.Several important techniques are deployed when a salesperson engages in cold calling or canvassing. The salesperson cannot arbitrarily walk into premises and meet a prospect. Before the canvassing starts, the salesman must be prepared and ready to meet any type of customer as the visit is sudden, unplanned, and without an appointment.Self-preparation for the event with knowledge about the product that is on sale, the company you represent and the environment likely to be faced, should be understood. Riskiest partLike in any sales situation, you must be thorough with the introduction that is suitable for your sudden appearance at the prospect’s doorstep. The ‘approach stage’ of the selling process in a pre-arranged sales meeting is different from a cold call. In such situations, the salesperson can be ready with research on the prospect of an appointment that was made before the visit.   Hence the salesman must be ready with effective key phrases and be ready with his purpose and positioning.  Approaching the prospect is probably the most important, yet the riskiest part of the process. In many instances, when I engaged in cold canvassing in the early days of my selling career, I was rejected by prospects many times. Therefore, the salesman must be prepared mentally to tolerate and gracefully take on the rejection. However, chances of rejection will be minimal if the salesman has confidence, and if you know that you are well prepared for the situation.  The salesperson must be very clear and brief about the organisation he represents and the exact purpose of the unannounced call. Simultaneously, the salesman must have a powerful strategic basis to request a dialogue. This must be very brief as you do not know whether the prospect has time for a discussion.  Many salespeople fail at this stage when they antagonise the prospect by trying to be hasty.The best is to ask if he has adequate time for a chat. If the salesman is powerful in his approach, there is a likelihood that the prospect will accept your request. If and when the prospect offers you the privilege of a conversation, you can offer specific details.  In a cold canvassing situation, the salesman visits a prospective customer who is not aware of your presence until you greet him. Therefore, after the initial approach, the salesman should act as an advisor or a helper. Not as a pitcher who tries to grab whatever opportunity available to him.  He must centre the conversation on the prospect and not on the product or service. As you cannot guess the end, it is good to focus on the beginning and keep your mindset and behaviour checked during the whole conversation. If you try to push forward too strong, the prospect will see the salesman as a common roadside vendor.  A prospect will respect and accept a pressure-free atmosphere and a sensible tone with reciprocal respect.  If you try to bulldoze, you will become a typical salesman and not a problem solver or an advisor.You must always remember, even today, many customers look at salespeople with a little distrust. Therefore, the salesperson’s dignified behaviour is important. It is good to genuinely connect with the customer rather than working on a set agenda. This behaviour can build trust in the prospect. You have to discuss the prospects issues and not yours or your employers. Creating initial trust must be a salesman’s primary goal and not making a sale at any cost. Genuine understanding and trust is the essence of building a relationship. An important fact to remember is that relationships can turn into sales.Getting past the gatekeepers is one of the biggest problems in cold calling. The role of the gatekeeper in business is to keep unwanted traffic away from the boss. Invariably, you will find someone at the entry point who most of the time tries to dismiss cold callers. This may be in person or a telephone call.A skilled salesman uses his charisma and creates a friendly and polite environment.If the salesperson does not sound like a typical salesman and implies that he is trying to be of service that will be beneficial to the prospect, the chances of getting past are more.    Defensive responseCold calling is usually done with small or medium level business establishments. Sales calls for larger organisations are done generally with prior appointments. Hence, when you confront an entrepreneur in a medium or small business organisation, staying positive and displaying confidence is a vital factor.Cold calls also often receive a defensive response from the prospect as they are caught off-guard. Therefore, establishing interest with a pre-arranged approach speech is important. Making them understand that your visit is mainly informative and that you are actually ‘not’ trying to sell today is a good method. In cold calling, being sincere and authentic is a must. The salesman must make sure that his sudden visit to a prospect is not intrusion. The salesman must also embrace rejection with grace which undoubtedly will please the prospect.However, a smart salesperson uses this brief opportunity to make a follow-up call at the prospect’s convenience.If the salesperson has handled the prospect in a friendly manner, he will offer another appointment. Another fact is that reaching out to the prospect after business hours or soon after lunch hour is better than calling during busy business hours.   The bottom line is that cold calling can be hard, yet often a necessity in any type of business, if they need to increase the pipeline that in turn boosts growth.Although the method seems tough to a new salesman, more experienced and skilled ones realise that cold calling and canvassing is a highly effective way of increasing sales volume. When the salesman gets used to practising this compulsory method constantly, the act becomes easy and enjoyable.  "
15 August 2021,Transforming Sri Lanka into a startup nation,"Post Covid-19, Sri Lanka will be in an ideal position for a major pivot away from its old safety net of traditional investments. With global trends favouring new investment opportunities, smart investors will do well to consider alternatives such as venture funding in startups to further add value to their portfolios, to ensure they are truly bullet proof in the face of future pandemics.Given the high risk, high reward nature of investing in startups, it is no wonder many shy away from this area. However, investing in venture funding mitigates much of that risk while ensuring better returns.Now is the time for innovation, with daily advances in many important fields that help further human understanding. For instance, today we are able ramp up production for ventilators and N95 masks in only a few weeks to combat Covid-19. These innovations aimed at helping the public have also resulted in significant profits for smart investors willing to take a chance on new technologies.South Asia has also benefited from venture funding, with India hosting the world’s third largest spawning ground for unicorns, which are startups valued at US$ 1 billion.With 57 unicorns, India is third in line behind China, at 155, and the USA, at 378 startups. Twenty of those unicorns reached this valuation last year.Some of India’s 2021 successes include Zomato, a food delivery platform that recently concluded a successful IPO where it was valued at US$ 12 billion; and Flipkart, an e-commerce giant currently valued at US$ 37.6 billion due to a funding round led by its main owner, Walmart.And with the correct mix fueling its startup sector, Sri Lanka may not be too far behind its northern neighbour.The country has already witnessed some major buyouts specific to the tech sector. For example, the 2009 acquisition of MillenniumIT by the London Stock Exchange Group for US$ 30 million, and Singapore-based supply chain enabler Zilingo acquiring nCinga for US$ 15.5 million in 2019. This is aside from Sri Lankan companies such as WSO2, which reported US$ 50 million in revenue last year. “One win for us, as well as the startup sector as a whole, was the nCinga acquisition by Zilingo in 2019”, according to BOV Capital Co-Founder Prajeeth Balasubramaniam.“We recouped around 30% of our fund from that one exit alone, so the startup sector in Sri Lanka is undoubtedly ripe for huge rewards. And our investors are already looking forward to even more exciting outcomes over the coming months.”BOV Capital has also done really well with its investment in online retailer Zigzag, which has steadily grown to become one of Sri Lanka’s top fashion brands, with hundreds of new designs launched monthly. And the mood of BOV Capital’s investor base remains positively buoyed due to investments in InsureMe, an InsureTech company focusing on B2C and B2B segment; Doc990, a  Health-Tech startup; and Roar, a regional media network, founded in Sri Lanka, that delivers content in English, Sinhala, Tamil, Hindi and Bengali.These outcomes have also proved to be very powerful, and positive, signals to those interested in Sri Lankan startups, attracting many inquiries about this emerging market from potential investors, who have become increasingly keen on taking part in local startup acceleration programs like Venture Engine.Another key point of interest is that Sri Lanka in many ways is a largely untapped marketplace. The country hosts around 400 startups, with many at the early stage and therefore significantly more attractive to first movers.And the innovation potential for local startups is much greater here since they are able to become profitable faster in a smaller test market like Sri Lanka, and grow globally thereafter.Sri Lanka may have a smaller pool of tech talent in numerical terms, but these human resources have already proved that they can build products that can compete globally.The country was ranked the second best for digital nomads in 2021, ahead of Singapore, by Club Med. This study by the French travel company looked at cost of living, safety, average internet speed, presence of nature and wellness spots, as well as adventurous activities in each country. Young Sri Lankan talent too is keen on returning to the country, and this brain gain has led to many successful startups in Sri Lanka being founded by returnees. These entrepreneurs studied in the best schools globally, and have worked for several years.The Government is also increasingly open to incentives and policies promoting the ICT sector, including providing tax breaks, infrastructure development focused on ICT exports and internet for every citizen. "
28 March 2021,An economic model that ensures fair distribution of benefits vital - Economist,"A  pragmatic alternative economic model which promotes sustainable growth  and ensures fair distribution of economic benefits to people should be implemented to get over the recurring debt crisis triggered by a shortfall of foreign reserves, said Senior Lecturer, Department of Accounting, University of Sri Jayawardenepura, Prof. Anil Fernando. He said although some  try to claim that our economy is on the right direction, it is facing a major  external debt crisis at present.The perennial practice of successive governments of borrowing to repay loans, wasteful and unproductive  investments   in the name of development projects, corruption, sluggish economic growth and insufficient foreign exchange earnings have resulted in a gradually deflating foreign reserve status. According to Central Bank statistics, the country needs USD 8,745.4 million to settle foreign loans and interest within a year from 1.2.2021 to  31.1.2022. Total official foreign reserve assets available at the end of February 2021 amounted to USD 4,555.7 million only. This is a high risk situation and it has  led the international debt rating agencies to downgrade Sri Lanka’s foreign debt paying ability  to CCC+ which is one level just above the default. “Foreign investors pulling out their money from the Colombo Stock Exchange is another indication that Sri Lanka does not have adequate foreign reserves to manage the external sector and as a result there is a great risk that the foreign exchange rate will start flying soon when the ability to hold it on comes to its tolerable limit,” Prof. Fernando said. Another indication of this crisis he said is the low  prices quoted for  Sri Lankan International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) traded in the secondary bond market. For example,  a Sri Lankan ISB  with a face value of USD 100 that matures in January 2022 is traded only at USD 74.25 thus resulting in a yield of more than 50% to investors. Hence, the government cannot even think of raising dollars by issuing new ISBs at such a cost. If the policy makers are not keen to solve the problem with the support of the people  at this juncture, they will not have many options, other than either to be subservient  to countries who offer bail outs for their own economic and geopolitical strategies or to sell national resources to foreigners for dollars. Even though policy makers claim that foreign investment can be attracted, a conducive environment for foreign  investments to boost investor confidence and trust is not seen in Sri Lanka. “Simple rejection of economic realities through the media and hiding the real issues will not solve the problem,” Prof. Fernando said, adding that the strategy of financialisation coupled with Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) by the policy makers is not conducive to the economy when there is no comprehensive master economic plan implemented to boost local production and aggregate demand in the country subject to other limitations of MMT. The excess money pumped to the economy could trigger inflation sooner or later and create even a financial bubble  in the future. “Therefore, It is of paramount importance for the Government to face this reality and to look for the cooperation of every citizen to fix this issue through an economic plan and a model which encourages people to engage in production, uses technology in an optimal manner and ensures a fair distribution of economic  benefits instead of paving the way for crooks and rouges to rob the nation,” Prof. Fernando said. He said implementation of standalone  strategies to run the daily affairs will be counter-productive. There are no short and quick answers to the perennial problem that prevails as a result of wrong economic policies adopted by successive governments.  "

22 August 2021,Young entrepreneur finds value in plastic waste,"As industrialisation and population increase, Sri Lanka is battling a threatening matter; the growth in irresponsible plastic waste disposal and management. Plastic consumption on the island sees a 16% increase, where 265,000 metric tons are consumed annually. Realising the damage this could cause, a young entrepreneur, Pathum Niranjana, started P&L Industries based in Athurugiriya in 2011 at the age of 20 to collect PET(Polyethylene Terephthalate) plastic and other plastics.A labour of love Now, 30, he recalled why he started the company, attributing it to the love he has for keeping the environment free of plastic waste. “Before starting P&L Industries, I worked for a company that collected PET plastic. I noticed that plastic was everywhere, from the sides of the road to the waterways. I then realised that I needed to venture out and diversify my business by not only limiting it to collecting PET plastic but also other types of plastic waste, too,” said Pathum. On a typical day, he deploys his team to collect and purchase waste plastic from municipal councils in the Western Province, after the respective municipalities collect from households and offices. Depending on the plastics’ quality, he buys PET bottles from municipal collectors for Rs. 20-30 a kilo and other plastics (HDPE and PP) for Rs. 60-70 a kilo.Every month, his team collects approximately 450,000 PET bottles and 70-80 metric tons of other plastics, then sold to recyclers to create value-added products. One such is Sri Lanka’s largest plastic recycler, Eco Spindles, which also assisted P&L Industries by giving a loan during the pandemic when collectors like Pathum saw a reduction in income.Though his business operations are now thriving, Pathum faced multiple challenges as a young business owner. When he started, establishing the business was problematic due to the lack of people/businesses with the necessary expertise in waste collection. Additionally, he required a team of employees who understood the trade while securing funds to buy a space to store plastic waste collected. Reversing stigma “An issue we faced then, and even now, is the stigma behind waste collectors as many people think it’s a third class business. But, it’s a business where you can make profits while also doing a service to the environment and our island home. Most have stigmatised the job as the role of a bothalpaththarakaraya, but the industry and the role has evolved into a formal employment opportunity,” said Pathum.Despite these challenges, Pathum persevered to see his dream materialise and reverse the stigma. Today, he owns four vehicles to collect, purchase and transport plastic to recyclers and has employed 15 people.“I have plans to grow my waste collection business. I want to include components of a recycling facility. So I bought a crusher machine to crush PET plastic into pellets, which I can sell to organisations that can make products such as yarn and crush HDPE plastic to make Alkathene pipes used in agriculture,” said Pathum.An opportunity to thriveOn his journey to expand P&L Industries, he believes Sri Lanka can thrive in the waste collection sector since Covid-19 has restricted imports.“If imported, PET pellets cost between Rs. 300-400 a kilo, while locally, I can sell to companies for Rs.150 a kilo. Because of this, it is important to know that banning PET bottles is not practical since we don’t have a cost-effective alternative. Glass is too costly and difficult to transport,” said Pathum. Pathum is a reminder that hard work and dedication are key pillars to success. Astonished that plastic waste is becoming a widely recognisable problem, he is on a quest to be part of a system that can provide viable solutions to this issue.“If collectors like myself do not collect and buy plastic waste, we run the risk of releasing the waste to open dumps and landfills, instead of sending it to recyclers who can give it new life,” said Pathum. Recycling ensures that a circular economy is established where the value of plastic bottles continues indefinitely. Pathum, as a collector, has become an integral part of this sustainable way of doing business."
16 August 2020,SEC Act implementation vital for capital market growth - Experts,"The speedy implementation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Act to demutualise the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), introduce Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) settlement system, greater selection of products, more issuers with sizeable free floats and tapping the top 20 percent of households to invest in the CSE are crucial to develop the market, said capital market experts urging the new Government to pay greater attention to develop the market. Past President of the Colombo Stock Brokers Association and Candor Group of Companies Director, Ravi Abeysuriya said it is imperative to implement the long overdue supply and demand side structural reforms to build a vibrant capital market.It is expected that the Government will pass the SEC Act soon to facilitate the demutualisation of the CSE, DVP settlement system, a central counterparty, improve governance standards and democratise the stock market for digital transactions. “When the new market infrastructure is up and running and the excesses if any are swiftly dealt with, the CSE will be well positioned to play a pivotal role for capital raising for large and small companies and a popular long term investment vehicle for institutional and retail investors,” Abeysuriya said.According to research, the major challenges affecting the stock market are its small size and low liquidity. It notes that solving the “size and liquidity” puzzle is critical to unlocking the potential of the Sri Lankan stock market which needs bold and visionary supply and demand side reforms at Government level.JB Securities (Pvt) Limited Managing Director Murtaza Jafferjee said the case for the capital markets has significantly improved with the decline in nominal interest rates from low double digits to mid-single digits.We need greater selection of products (gsec trading on the CSE, index futures, REITs), more issuers with sizeable free floats (IPOs), targetting the top 20% of households to invest a greater proportion of their financial wealth via the capital market, legal structures to enable greater pooling (e.g. limited partnerships), implementing much delayed market infrastructure (Delivery vs Payment and Central Counter Party) and for the regulator to improve market conduct and reduce abuse (e.g. insider dealing, front running, market manipulation, fiduciary duty of intermediaries towards their clients) for the industry to grow.Lack of clarity and stability in policy, fluctuating e rates, high fiscal deficit and a weak currency have adversely affected the growth of the economy for years and this has had an effect on the investor confidence on the country and the capital market."
3 May 2020,Prepare now for the next crisis,"Events are unfolding with astounding speed and the picture changes on a daily basis. A few months ago, it looked like the outbreak was mostly confined to China and was being brought under control.More recently, a number of fast-growing epicenters of infection have sprung up beyond China especially in the western world, signaling a new phase and potentially necessitating new strategies of mitigation rather than containment. With that the world of business has dramatically changed already and more changes are envisaged due to the Covid 19 virus.When we emerge from this crisis, business leaders will have to reinvent almost all aspects of business. While re-strategizing to overcome the Covid 19. Over the past two decades we have come out of many pandemics but of course of different magnitude. Covid-19 is not a one-off challenge. We should expect additional phases to the current epidemic and more frequent pandemics in the future.Preparing for the next crisis now is likely to be much more effective than an ad hoc, reactive response when the next crisis actually hits. Given the very different degrees of preparedness across Sri-Lankan companies, further potential for disruption, and the value of being better prepared for future crises, it’s worth trying to extract what we have learned so far so the Sri-Lankan companies better cushion the future shocks. Impacted by the Covid 19, many companies run scenarios to create intellectual preparedness for unexpected situations. Scenarios must be updated and customized, however, in the light of the most material risks to a business at any given time.Intellectual preparedness alone is not enough, however. Something can be well understood but unrehearsed as a capability. Scenarios should therefore ideally be backed up by war gaming to simulate and learn from behaviors under stress. A war room set-up as opposed to general risk management, with a small dedicated team empowered to decide and execute, can cut through organizational complexity.Rather than heaving a sigh of relief and returning to normal routines when the crisis subsides, efforts should be made not to squander a valuable learning opportunity.Even while the crisis is unfolding, responses and impacts should be documented to be later reviewed and lessons distilled. Rapidly evolving situations expose existing organizational weaknesses, like an inability to make hard decisions or an excessive bias towards consensus, which constitute opportunities for improvement.For example, airline safety is one of the most effective global learning systems we have in this respect. Each time there is an incident from minor mishaps to tragic accidents resulting in lives lost, root causes are investigated in forensic detail according to pre-agreed protocols, and binding recommendations are made. It’s not surprising that flying has become one of the safest forms of travel, thanks to cumulative learning and adaptations from previous misfortunes.We should expect that the Covid-19 crisis will change our businesses and society in important ways. It is likely to fuel areas like online shopping, online education, and public health investments, for example. It is also likely to change how companies configure their supply chains and reinforce the trend away from dependence on few mega-factories and single source.When the urgent part of the crisis has been navigated, companies should consider what this crisis has changed and what they have learned so they can reflect on them in their plans."

1 August 2021,SLT-Mobitel powers Ananke IoT Services to shine at Globee  Awards,"SLT-Mobitel’s partner Ananke IoT Services (Pvt) Ltd has been conferred a Gold award under the ‘Start-up of the Year – IT Category’ at the 16th Annual 2021 IT World Awards.Organizers of the world’s premier business awards programs and business ranking lists,The Globee® Awards;recognised Ananke IoT’s Smart Bins Project, powered by NB-IoT technology from SLT-Mobitel, the undisputed leader of IoT services and related digital transformation in Sri Lanka.SLT-Mobitel’s NB-IoT network enables the entire device connectivity chain of the Smart Bins Project and is Sri Lanka’s only such network to-date. NB-IoT is the GSMA standard for Low-Power-Wide-Area Internet of Things connectivity, which is particularly suited to ensure the battery life of a sensor extends to up to 10 years. As the only telco to offer this advanced technology in Sri Lanka, SLT-Mobitel was perfectly positioned to support Ananke IoT Services for quick deployment of its Smart Bins solution. This is the first large-scale NB-IoT enabled hardware project in Sri Lanka and uses Ananke IoT’s in-house built proprietary platform.“As the National ICT and Mobile Service Provider, SLT-Mobitel strives to craft customer centric technological solutions. With the pandemic, we observed several of our valued stakeholders seeking to adopt Digital Services, particularly in areas of IoT and automation to reduce the need for unnecessary human intervention in business processes. Owing to our pioneering efforts in rolling out an NB-IoT Network ahead of market demand, we were able to power innovative start-ups such as Ananke IoT Services with a rapid deployment of their NB-IoT Smart Bins,” said Chief Executive Officer, Mobitel, Chandika Vitharana.The overall objective of the project is to improve PET plastic waste collection and recycling in Central, Uva and North Western Provinces in partnership with provincial and local authorities and schools. The project enables the circularity of PET packaging waste in these areas as a ‘give-back life’ initiative. As the name suggests, these smart bins fixed with sensors notify the respective provincial and local authorities when it is time for the garbage to be collected.CEO of Ananke IoT Services, Charith Vithanage said, “It is very important to mention that, the unstinted support and contribution from all our major stakeholders including SLT-Mobitel was a key factor in implementing this large scale islandwide project.”“Behind this distinguished success is our product innovations and relentless drive to stay customer focused, very much like our connectivity partner SLT-Mobitel. We believe this recognition from Globee Awards further validates our commitment to our customers and their security needs,” said Keerthi Kodithuwakku, Founding Director of Ananke IoT Services and CEO of Effective Solutions (Pvt) Ltd., the parent company of Ananke."
29 July 2018,Threads of Time - the business and glamour of fashion,"Threads of Time, the fashion extravaganza presented by Anita Dorai featuring the designs of Singaporean Kavita Thulasidas of Stylemart on September 2 at the Hilton Ballroom, will be a show that takes you through a travel in time, says the organiser.Thulasidas says, “Threads of Time will be a magical journey of the mystical and mythological eras inspired by the celestial beauties of Hindu mythology, from the love stories of Laila Majnu and Jodha Akbar bringing out the essence of love in the Mogul and Rajput Era, to the nymphs and myths of the Grecian and Roman Goddesses and to the era of my favourite designer, Frenchman Paul Poiret, the period of the 1920s where fashion was art, reflecting modern mysticism in an extreme opulence of glitz and glamour.”As this is Kavita’s inspiration for her maiden Sri Lankan fashion show, local audiences are indeed in for a treat. An important feature of the show is that all garments will go on sale soon after the show, while it will also continue, thereafter, for two days at the Hilton.Presenter Anita Dorai said that proceeds from the show will be in aid of Around the Pearl an initiative by Wheels for Wheels which aims to raise awareness of Cerebral Palsy which affects over 40,000 children in Sri Lanka today.“The proceeds from Threads of Time will be used to buy a special type of wheelchair which will greatly enhance the quality of life for those suffering from this dreaded disease. The target set by Wheels for Wheels initially is a 1,000 of these special wheelchairs,” she said.Choreography will be by Brian Kerkoven with Imran Saibo of Funtime and Anusha David of Headlines PR handling the logistics of the show. "
6 September 2020,CSE roadmap for expansion,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has launched a five-pronged strategy to enhance the attractiveness of the Stock Exchange and make it a leading market for trading in the region, said CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando in an interview with Sunday Observer Business on Friday.He said the strategic plan backed by the new government with a ministry dedicated to develop the capital market will be a major boost to develop a vibrant market for all investors.The CSE team met the State Minister of Money, Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms, Ajith Nivard Cabraal last week for the first time to discuss areas to revive the capital market.“The discussion focused on areas such as revitalising capital mobilisation and risk management, wealth generation for all citizens and setting up a trusted venue for trading and depository services,” Fernando said. CSE development strategies are centered on re-rating valuations of CSE from being at the bottom of peer markets, attracting new listings to boost liquidity, develop and return the CSE to operating profitably.The CSE’s price to book valuation which is .9 times is low compared to India’s 2.8 percent, Vietnam’s 1.9 percent and Pakistan’s 1.5 percent.“We are at the bottom of rating and the question is how do we re rate valuations to rebuild confidence for investors,” the CSE chief said, adding that the current low interest rates will help boost the market.He said the CSE will engage with the Government to look at obtaining certain incentives and tax treatments.The CSE will focus on promotion strategies and reviving overseas marketing programs and improve investor relations practices to impart information.The Stock Exchange aims at attracting large entities to inject more liquidity to the market through larger companies.“We have developed a survey on impediments to listing in the CSE. We will focus on attracting listings of tech sector firms which are not at a satisfactory level,” Fernando said, adding that the CSE anticipates at least three large companies listing IPOs.As of April this year the CSE comprised 290 listed entities with a market capitalisation of around Rs. 2,748.10 billion. The number of companies with a market capitalisation of over Rs. 10 billion in the CSE has increased from 44 a decade ago to 53 today and the number of entities with a market cap of over Rs. 50 billion has reduced from 12 to 11 during the corresponding period.However, the CSE chief is upbeat about the growth of the market with interest rates on a downward trajectory.“Digitisation is a major component of the expansion drive to get more retail investors on-board,” Fernando said.Trading activities at the CSE will be digitised from September 17 to offer an efficient service. A digital app will be launched to enable investors to on-board digitally. The app will help investors to operate even during a lockdown scenario. The move will enable telcos to generate customer leads.The CSE plans to open branches in the Western Province and increase financial literacy. The Stock Exchange will improve trust with key stakeholders such as issuers, investors and the public. The number of referrals from CSE to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on market surveillance has dropped to 70 percent and client complaints to 70 percent which shows that there is more trust in the market.“We are currently working with the SEC on setting up an independent client dispute resolution mechanism, the Delivery Versus Payment settlement method to be delivered by the first quarter next year and the Central Counterparty to reduce settlement risk,” Fernando said.The CSE chief said the CSE has to return to operating profitably and added that new products such as education certificates, gold based products and mortgages as securities will be explored. "
17 January 2021,CSE’s performance boosts investor confidence,"The consistent growth in the levels of activity and overall performance of the Colombo Stock Market over a period of nine months and the increased levels of investor participation in the stock market offers strong reasons for investors to be optimistic, a media release from the .Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) stated.The Benchmark All Share Price Index (ASPI) has indicated a gain of 75% since falling to its lowest point in a decade on May 12, 2020 and presently records 7,443.23 points. The S&P SL20 index, which includes the 20 largest and most liquid shares has also grown by 65% since 12thMay 2020 to 2,782.17 points. These statistics indicate that the stock market has consistently gathered momentum over a considerable level of time, with the turnaround in the indices being dated back to mid Q2, 2020. There is, therefore, little reason to believe that the revival of the Sri Lankan stock market has been unjustifiable.The growth of the indices and investor interest in the Sri Lankan stock market also comes at a time when peer regional and other global stock markets have indicated positive returns, giving reason to believe that the interest levels in equities in Sri Lanka is consistent with a global trend of a sustainable resurgence in stock markets around the world. Considering a low interest rate regime that has prevailed in 2020 and even at present. Investors have been turning to the stock market as their preferred choice for investment.The CSE welcomes the resurgence of the Sri Lankan stock market and is committed to consolidating on this resurgence to introduce growth initiatives that will sustain the performance and interest in our stock market.The regulatory framework of the stock market has been strengthened on several aspects in recent times including the supervision of stock broker firms, monitoring of market risk and credit risk and market Surveillance and Enforcement Mechanisms for listed companies.Given the increased level of market activity the CSE has taken measures to heighten the level of regulatory supervision, market surveillance and monitoring of risk.The CSE has been proactively taking such measures in the past and will continue to do so.The CSE remains strongly focused on maintaining the confidence of investors by preserving the market’s integrity and quality and being fully aware that it is only by operating a fair, orderly and transparent market that it will be possible to sustain this level of investor confidence and performance, the release further added."
19 September 2021,Traders need to make sacrifices to support the economy - Pettah Business Assn. Secy,"Traders and consumers big or small have to make sacrifices and bear with the new regulation on cash margin for imports to support the economy during the current tough times until certain stability has been restored, Pettah Business Association Secretary Chaminda Vidanagamage told the Sunday Observer Business last week.“Our Association members understand the needs of the country and are ready to make sacrifices until the economy is back on track,” Vidanagamage said. However, sharing the sentiments of certain merchants, particularly the small and medium sector entrepreneurs in the country, Vidanagamage said the 100 percent cash margin on LCs would hit the SME sector traders importing goods.“The move would have an impact on prices and it could result in creating a market monopoly enabling large scale businesses to dominate the market with high prices,” Vidanagamage said. The Central Bank Sri Lanka imposed a 100% cash margin when opening letters of credit for 623 items last week. The items range from mobile phones, chocolates, cereal and a variety of clothing.Former Central Bank Deputy Governor and Commercial Bank Chairman Dham Dheerasinghe said the cash margin regulation is not a ban on imports but rather a move to curtail imports of not so essential goods.“There will not be a major price high as exaggerated by certain sections. If at all there will be only a marginal increase in prices on the selected items. The importer has to at whatever point pay the margin and it is only on certain items with the HS Code,” Dheerasinghe said. However, he also acknowledged the fact that mobile phones and devices needed for education could affect students who currently rely on such devices today. The 623 items under the Customs codes also include, spaghetti, apple juice, wine, oats, soya milk, dairy goods, lipstick, carpets, coats, anoraks, and electronic goods.Former State Minister of Finance Ajith Nivard Cabraal  and current Central Bank Governor when contacted said  the government will look into all the needs of the traders and consumers if a need arises due to the move.“A scarcity causing price hikes is an exaggeration by the bankrupt Opposition which jacked up prices and interest rates during its tenure. They have no right to talk about a grave need to support the economy,” Cabraal said, adding that there will be no increase in the prices of goods as shown by the Opposition and certain sections of the business community. We will take care of any situation that may emerge.” He said this is not a new scenario to bring fiscal discipline in the country and added that there had been such drastic measures taken in the past to curtail the outflow of foreign exchange and promote local production. “The interest rates were double than the current rates during the tenure of the past government of which  some members try to make a hue and cry when they burden the business community and stifle economic growth with short-sighted policies,” Cabraal said.However, SME sector traders and consumers have raised concerns of a possible price increase of the items on which the 100 percent cash margin has been imposed. The banking sector regulator  decided to impose a 100 percent cash margin deposit against imports of certain non essential and non-urgent goods to support the ongoing efforts to preserve the stability of the exchange rate and foreign currency market liquidity, particularly by discouraging excessive imports of speculative nature. Licensed Commercial Banks are barred from granting advances to customers to enable them  to meet the minimum cash margin deposit."
12 September 2021,"Lanka, a vital trade partner in S. Asia - Malaysian HC","The Sri Lanka-Malaysia Business Council of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce held its 27th Annual General Meeting virtually.The High Commissioner of Malaysia to Sri Lanka, Tan Yang Thai was the chief guest. Khalid Farouk was elected as the new President of the Business Council for 2021/2022.Outgoing President of SLMBC, Keerthi Jayasuriya said, “When took office as President of the Sri Lanka-Malaysia Business council, we hoped to make some contribution towards further improving business ties between our two countries, which would go even some little way towards minimising the imbalance in trade between the two countries.“However, little did I know that Covid was round the corner with an agenda of its own. Under the circumstances, we did what was possible. The Council organised a few webinars that we thought would benefit the business community and we supported four entrepreneurs who were affected by the pandemic to restart their business under a micro finance scheme. The Council continued and improved on the CSR activities. The most notable being the donation of a BiPAP Machine to Kegalle General Hospital,” he said.Ambassador Tan Yang Thai said, “I am glad that SLMBC has been entrusted to an able hand and a long term friend of Malaysia. Currently we are going through a very challenging time.Many businesses have been badly affected and the world economy is suffering tremendously. I believe we need to be thinking out of the box, be more adventurous and innovative in overcoming these challenges.“We must strive to continue to further strengthen the economic cooperation between Sri Lanka and Malaysia.My colleagues and I at the High Commission are always ready to lend our assistance to you in this regard. Despite the constant threat of the covid-19 pandemic in the past one-and-a-half years, we have managed to organise a few important events. It gives me great pleasure to affirm the close cooperation that exists between SLMBC and the High Commission.It is my fervent hope that after both our two countries’ borders are totally opened, we will continue where we left off.“There are vast opportunities and economic sectors in Sri lanka and Malaysia which remained untapped. We should undertake our best efforts to bring trade delegations and organize meetings with potential business partners. SLMBC should continue to be the bridge between the business sectors of our two countries,” he said.“Bilateral trade between our two nations continues to be badly affected due to the covid-19 pandemic. Malaysia’s total bilateral trade with Sri Lanka was at an all-time high of USD 929.1 million in 2019, with 19.3 percent growth, which is the highest in the South Asia region for that year. However, due to the pandemic, total bilateral trade for 2020 dropped significantly to reach slightly over USD 600 million. Having said that, I would like to re-emphasize that Malaysia still regard Sri Lanka as an important trade and investment partner in the South Asian region,” the Ambassador said.For the period 2021-2022: Khalid Farouk, Managing Partner, Ilham Inspiration was elected as the President of SLMBC, while Mohamed Hameez, Managing Director, Spillburg Holdings and HsinHaw Li, Business Development Manager, Public Bank Berhad were elected as Vice Presidents. Keerthi Jayasuriya, Chairman and CEO of International Scholar Educational Services (Pvt) Ltd will serve as the Immediate Past President.The committee elected will be represented by Amana Bank, Acorn Aviation, Aitken Spence Shipping, FMG Plastic, Flexicare Lanka, Mansoor Gems and Softlogic City Hotels. "
14 March 2021,"Women’s job loss rate, 1.8 times higher than men - Study","The job loss rate for women due to the global pandemic is 1.8 times higher than for males according to McKinsey Global Institute, a global business and economics research body.The extent to which the pandemic  impacts women was spotlighted at a  recent ‘Bell Ringing’ ceremony at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) to mark the World’s Women’s Day on March 8. IFC, a member of the World Bank Group partnered CSE to Ring the Bell for Gender Equality in Sri Lanka for the sixth consecutive year. It was stressed that the economic and social consequences of Covid-19 continued to disproportionately impact women – who make up 39 percent of global employment but account for 54 percent of the overall job losses due to the pandemic. Despite some progress, women remain underrepresented in business leadership with only 17 percent holding board seats globally. However, IFC-CSE research indicates that around 9.5 percent of board directors of listed companies in Sri Lanka are women — a 30 percent increase from 2018.  “Despite unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, our research indicates a positive trend in the number of female directors on boards in Sri Lanka,” said Corporate Governance Officer, IFC, LopaRahman.He said  since the start of the  research in 2018, over 75 senior and qualified women have joined corporate boards in Sri Lanka. “We believe diverse representation on boards clearly leads to positive business impacts,” Rahman said.In Sri Lanka, IFC research has highlighted that the top 30 CSE-listed companies with higher gender diversity perform better in terms of financial measures, including return on equity, return on total assets, and price to earnings ratio. IFC’s “Women on Boards” program in Sri Lanka is part of the broader efforts to increase women’s private sector participation and leadership by promoting the adoption of corporate governance practices among Sri Lankan companies. IFC’s work in this area is supported by the Government of Australia under the IFC-DFAT Women in Work program.Studies show that making even small inroads in closing the global gender gap could quickly yield strong results, with the potential to increase gross domestic product (GDP) by $12 trillion by 2025. “We are pleased to again join IFC and our other partners to ring the bell for gender equality in 2021,” said Chairman of CSE, Dumith Fernando.“The event this year takes largely a virtual form compared to events in previous years, given the restrictions posed by Covid-19 on public gatherings.  “However, CSE was keen to continue the momentum and use the Bell Ringing ceremony as a call to action in 2021 as well, because we strongly believe that the greater participation of women in our workforce, economy and capital market can make a positive impact to society and our country at-large. “As we recover from a global pandemic, we encourage corporates to capitalise on the skills of women in the workforce today to spur on our recovery,” he said.Accelerating the pace of gender parity could lead to important economic, environmental, social, and governance gains in emerging and frontier markets.The annual global event highlights how women’s participation in the economy can spur sustainable private sector development."
15 November 2020,AIA’s new business up 22 percent in third quarter,"HONG KONG, November 9  – AIA Group Limited has recorded  key new business indicators for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020.  In the third quarter of 2020, the Group delivered strong momentum in new business sales. VONB  increased by 22 per cent compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by sequential quarter on-quarter growth from almost all of our markets. VONB margin was consistent with the second  quarter as the reduction from economic assumption changes and geographical mix shifts was  offset by reduced acquisition expense overruns as quarterly sales momentum improved. Across  our agency businesses, we have continued to build future capacity with new recruits up more  than 20 per cent compared to the third quarter of 2019.While sales volumes during the first nine months of 2020 were lower than for the same period  last year, the overall scale of our in-force business has continued to increase. TWPI of  US$8,797 million increased 7 per cent compared with the third quarter of 2019. The third quarter of 2020 marked a historic change for AIA China, beginning with the incorporation  of our new subsidiary in Mainland China on 9 July. Our people worked tirelessly on the conversion  process, which included coordination with more than 2,000 counterparties and 150 government  departments across the country. In  the third quarter, VONB from AIA China was broadly similar to the second quarter before allowing  for 5 per cent withholding tax, which has been applied since 9 July.AIA China remained the  largest contributor to the Group’s VONB. In the first nine months of 2020, we have continued to  grow our high-quality Premier Agency force and our disciplined execution has achieved a  double-digit increase in new recruits, total agents and also agency leaders.  AIA Thailand achieved strong quarter-on-quarter growth in the third quarter as sales momentum  returned to both agency and bancassurance channels. Our businesses in Singapore and  Malaysia delivered excellent quarter-on-quarter growth with VONB more than double the second  quarter and also significantly above the third quarter of 2019. The easing of movement restrictions across many markets supported excellent quarter-on quarter growth in VONB for our Other Markets segment. Tata AIA Life achieved excellent year on-year growth on a like-for-like basis despite the ongoing disruption to the Indian economy from  the pandemic and has now become the market leader in retail protection business. All of our  other individual markets in this segment delivered quarter-on-quarter growth in VONB. After the sharp contraction in the global economy in the first half of 2020, some countries have  returned to growth in the third quarter, including Mainland China. Economic recovery has  diverged significantly at the country level, driven by the effectiveness of pandemic containment  measures and government policies as well as the importance and competitiveness of  manufacturing industries.The medium-term outlook remains highly uncertain given COVID-19  infections have been rising in many countries and political and trade tensions remain elevated.  However, the demand for AIA’s products and services will continue to grow over the long term,  powered by the structural drivers of rising wealth, low insurance penetration levels and limited  social welfare across Asia. "
1 March 2020,ComBank rings bell to mark centenary year,"Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC (Commercial Bank) rang the Opening Bell to commence trading at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) on Thursday to celebrate its 100-year anniversary.The event was a part of a series of initiatives conducted by the bank to celebrate this significant milestone.Special market opening ceremonies are organised by the CSE as a platform for listed companies to celebrate corporate milestones and as a call to action for causes and developments that are significant to our business community, economy and society at large.CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike said, “Commercial Bank has continued to Support the Exchange, on initiatives to promote and present the Sri Lankan Capital Market amongst local and foreign investors which is very much appreciated, and I thank the leadership of the organisation for the support extended to CSE.”Chairman of Commercial Bank Dharma Dheerasinghe said, “The stock market is much more than a place for brokers to buy and sell shares of companies, which I believe is the common belief among the public and even within some in the business community.The Stock Exchange plays a far more pivotal role in allowing businesses access to capital and providing the opportunity for companies to enhance their visibility and public image.” "
31 January 2021,Exporters take note of ‘zombies’ - Expert,"“The imminent dangers to the world economy as a result of seemingly unlimited money printing processes initiated by Central Banks worldwide was highlighted in my article “Global Crisis on the Horizon”. The results of this fiscal policy in combination with a zero-interest policy is felt worldwide now”, said German investor and social scientist Dr. Dietmar Doering.He said interestingly the real economic meltdown does not correlate with the performance of share indices in the International Stock Exchanges. Their share values show an appreciating increment.However, these bull market indices do not reflect the real economic performances of countries at all. Why does the economic meltdown not reflect a downfall in the stock exchanges is the question? The excessive printing of money had resulted in a decoupling of the real economy with everything which is traded on Stock Exchanges. The sheer unlimited printing of money has reached dimensions which experts even did not forecast in their worst predictions. Zero and negative interest scenarios created by the central banks led to more interbank borrowings and subsequently to companies which are or were already on the brink of bankruptcy.The core banking business which is based on granting loans and generating interest, had been virtually hollowed out with the zero-interest policy. And as a result, the zombification of the real economy took place at the same time. Due to the zero interest rate policies of major central banks, enterprises which are virtually bust are being enabled to carry on their business due to capital provisions freely available at a little more than zero interest rates.He said banks nowadays had to revert back to their traditionally high-risk business engaging in hedge fund deals and other high risk investments, which the Banking supervisory authorities after the 2008 crash virtually prohibited but have now become daily reality again.The low interest scenario allows companies which are virtually bust or insolvent to temporarily extend their survival on credit lines which are willingly provided by commercial banks as their own last... survival scenario to generate income for lending to enterprises. Official European Central Bank statistics as at today confirm that approximately two million companies in the EU zone are practically insolvent and in Germany alone around 600,000 companies are facing bankruptcy in the very near future.The word zombification of enterprises has become the common nom for this new phenomenon. It seems that the traditional and proven mechanisms of the Market economy had been dismantled by way of severe government interventions worldwide.For example, a new German Law in place now for almost six months permits enterprises a grace period by allowing them to delay insolvency declaration, which was prior to these dates absolute mandatory.The unavoidable side effect is that practically already bust companies continue doing business unabated. Related business partners being unaware of the economic difficulties of their partner companies may run into difficulties thereafter, when due payments out of services rendered to their partners running dry.The general caution notices for Sri Lankan exporters to secure their outstanding as a result of their deliveries and services to European companies should be focused in line with the increased drastic economic developments in the EU zone. “If alone in Germany 600,000 companies are more or less insolvent, and in line of this a significant number of partner companies in Germany and abroad are unaware of their economic situation, greatest caution should be taken to secure outstanding from deliveries and services provided.The Sri Lanka Export Development board should take great attention to these unavoidable developments in the EU Zone and prevent Sri Lanka exporters to fall in trouble,” Dr. Doering said."

25 October 2020,Comprehending “Mind of the Strategist” amid Covid-19,"While the Covid-19 pandemic continues to create panic, life must move on safely and serenely. I revisited one of my favourite authors on strategy, Kenichi Ohmae. His masterpiece and repeated bestselling book with a fitting title, “Mind of the Strategist” inspired me again. I saw much relevance in what he discussed with the dire reality of Covid-19. Let us deliberate further.Overview“Strategic success cannot be reduced to a formula, nor can anyone become a strategic thinker merely by reading a book”, said Kenichi Ohmae, who is not a stranger to strategy. Still brilliant at the age of 73, he is often sought out as a public speaker and management consultant.As an acclaimed author he has published over 230 books, many of which are devoted to business and socio-political analyses. As his website reveals, he has also contributed numerous articles to major publications such as Wall Street Journal and Harvard Business Review. The Mind of the Strategist, Triad Power, Beyond National Borders, The Borderless World, The End of the Nation State are some of his seminal contributions.The “Mind of the Strategist” was first published in 1975 in Japan. Despite the continuing , local, regional, and global, its central message still remains valid and valued. “Analysis is the critical starting point of the “Mind of the Strategist”. It is not hearsay that you should use it for rushed decisions with ad hoc planning. Comprehensive analysis with clarity and coherence is the crucial need. It is much relevant with the continuing Covid-19 as well.Analysis is a cognitive process of breaking a complex puzzle into smaller parts to gain a better understanding of it. It essentially means separating a situation into parts and examining the parts in an attempt to understand what is occurring. In business scenarios, analysis involves identifying business needs related to a situation, identifying critical issues, and determining possible solutions.As Kenichi emphasises, analysis is the critical starting point of strategic thinking. Manager’s need intellectual flexibility and creativity to devise realistic responses to changing situations. In doing so, they need to ask the right questions in a solution-oriented manner and conduct appropriate analyses to formulate the needed game plan. He reiterates, “the object of strategy is to bring about the conditions most favourable to one’s own side in helping one’s organisation to succeed in its purpose.”“The strategist’s method is very simply to challenge the prevailing assumptions with a single question: Why?”, observes Ohmae. In fact, the popular and proven Japanese techniques such as “Five Why Method” highlights the significance of this. “It is hard to let old beliefs go. They are familiar. We are comfortable with them and have spent years building systems and developing habits that depend on them”, he states emphasising the need to refer to “why” more often. “Like a man who has worn eyeglasses so long that he forgets he has them on, we forget that the world looks to us the way it does because we have become used to seeing it that way through a particular set of lenses.”Three Cs as the coreKenichi argued that the fundamentally strategic thinking revolves around three Cs, corporation, customers and competitors. “Faced with problems, trends, events, or situations that appear to constitute a harmonious whole or come packaged as a whole by common sense of the day, the strategic thinker dissects them into their constituent parts. Then, having discovered the significance of these constituents, he or she reassembles them in a way calculated to maximise his or her advantage.”Sadly, we forget these fundamentals and fall into pitfalls in so called strategic planning without proper strategy. It reminds me of what Henry Mintzberg said, drawing a parallel from John Godfrey Saxe who wrote a poem on “Six blind men and an elephant”. “We are the blind people and strategy formation is our elephant”, says Mintzberg. “One has grabbed hold of some part or other and “railed on in utter ignorance” about the rest. We certainly do not get an elephant by adding up its parts. An elephant is more than that. Yet to comprehend the whole we also need to understand the parts.”It is obvious that being strategic is of utmost importance in the business context. It essentially shows how “smart” you are in “playing the game”. The roots are from the Greek word strategios, which means the art of the General. Obviously, it has a military connotation. How a general orders the troops to attack, or to withdraw or to surround the enemy, with the aim of winning the war in mind. A battle front and a business front have a lot in common, particularly with the sky-rocketing competition, globally and locally.“In business as on the battlefield, the object of strategy is to bring about the conditions most favourable to one’s own side, judging precisely the right moment to attack or withdraw and always assessing the limits of compromise correctly, said Kenichi Ohmae. “Besides the habit of analysis, what marks the mind of the strategist is an intellectual elasticity or flexibility that enables him to come up with realistic responses to changing situations, not simply to discriminate with great precision among different shades of grey”.It is essentially to discover, design and deliver with regards to the interplay between corporation or company, customers and competitors. “A fascinating window into the mind of one of Japan’s premier strategists”, said Michael E. Porter, strategy stalwart from Harvard in admiring Ohmae. The purpose of strategy is to maximize one’s advantage. On a battlefield, this means picking the right place to fight, the right time to attack, the right time to retreat, weighing and re-assessing as circumstances change, but always with gaining maximum advantage in mind.Strategic thinkingAs Kenichi Ohmae advocates, “strategic thinking involves trying to anticipate what might, will or could occur in a situation and how it is possible to shape or influence what is occurring so that what one wants to occur actually occurs”.In fact, strategic thinking involves both thinking about consequences and choosing actions to achieve objectives. Such an endeavour also involves trying to turn a situation to one’s advantage. It further involves asking the right questions in a solution-oriented manner and conducting appropriate analyses to formulate the required “game plan”. This is inclusive of anticipating competitor actions and preparing to counter or thwart them. Essentially, it revolves around holistic thinking with company, customers and competitors in mind.Strategies are not purely deliberate. “Theorists agree that intended, emergent, and realized strategies may differ from one another”, observes Mintzberg, in a similar line with Ohmae. This is very relevant to Sri Lanka where the strategies deliberated prior to the prevalence of Covid-19 must be revisited. Same was the case last year where the Easter Sunday Attack was a damaging disruption. It reminds us of the often neglected fact that change is the only permanent reality. Whether we will be having a “V” turn of economic recovery as some anticipated in handling Covid-19 with the right set of emergent strategies remains to be seen.“Rowing harder doesn’t help if the boat is headed in the wrong direction,” said Ohmae. It is applicable to institutions and nations alike. In his much-acclaimed book, “Mind of the Strategist”, there is much evidence to support the cause of an analytical approach towards crafting strategies. It brings to life the dynamic nature of strategy with its associated subtlety and variety. It is an invitation to explore the extent to which Japanese organisations have excelled with proper crafting and executing of strategies.Paradoxically, strategy is analytical as well as intuitive. Intuition refers to the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning. It is a common fact that entrepreneurs are more driven by “gut instinct” in pursuing their aspirations.“The best possible solutions come only from a combination of a rational analysis based on the nature of things, and imaginative reintegration of all the different items into a new pattern, using non-linear brain power”, said Ohmae, highlighting the interplay needed between intuition and information.Interestingly, Kenichi Ohmae demonstrated this subtle synergy between simultaneously being analytical and intuitive in his unique lifestyle playing multiple roles. He has been a gifted flautist, nuclear physicist, prolific author, political activist, McKinsey consultant and after all a thought leader of true calibre.Such a multi-disciplinary approach ensures a holistic, humane and humble way of demonstrating the “mind of the strategist”. "
14 March 2021,External sector recovers in January,"The  external sector continued to recover in many aspects during January 2021, mainly supported by an improved trade deficit and a notable increase in workers’ remittances. The reduced deficit in the trade account in January 2021 compared to January 2020 was the result of a larger decline in merchandise imports over merchandise exports.Workers’ remittances continued to record a notable growth in January 2021, strengthening the external current account.In the financial account, foreign investment in the government securities market recorded a marginal net inflow while the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recorded net outflows in January 2021."
28 March 2021,Be an informed investor ,"(Part 7 appeared last week)Buying a stock means ownership in a company and ownership gives you certain rights. As a shareholder, knowing your rights is an essential part of being an informed investor. Although the regulatory bodies attempt to enforce a certain degree of shareholder rights, a well-informed investor who fully understands his or her rights is much less vulnerable to risks.As a shareholder, you may need to make decisions about taking up various rights and benefits offered by the companies you have invested in. In each case, you should keep your investment goals and strategy in mind and consult an adviser. Annual General Meeting (AGM): CSE-listed companies conduct an AGM where shareholders vote on electing new directors to the board and other resolutions relating to the company’s business. The Chairperson of the board and company Chief Executive Officer usually address the meeting. You will be sent a notice of meeting outlining when and where the AGM is to be held. Many investors see the AGM as a good opportunity to hear what the senior management have to say. This also is an ideal platform for an investor to ask any question he/she may have with regards to the functionality of the organization.Reports and information: CSE-listed companies issue annual and interim financial reports to shareholders. Reading these reports is a good way to keep in touch with the company’s business and future prospects whilst keeping abreast of the financial performance of the organization. Corporate actions:  This refers to a company making changes to its securities distribution. For example, a rights issue carried out by a listed company would result in an increase in the number of shares issued.  These can be complex, and they can affect the share price, you should consider consulting an adviser before acting on these.Final stepExperience is one of the best teachers and as an investor you will learn from both your successes and your mistakes. It’s best to start off with a small investment in order to learn how it works and gradually increase the value of your portfolio. The first thing to do is contact a stockbroker. You do not have to start trading but setting up a CDS account is a useful starting place. Next, keeping up to date with the market is a great way to build your knowledge and confidence. After a study on the market dynamics you would be able to identify the right time to enter and with the assistance of your investment advisor identify the correct stock to purchase. How to find out more about the CSE There are many sources of investor education, for the novice and the more experienced investor. The CSE Website (visit: cse.lk) Publications of the Colombo Stock Exchange CSE Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Quarterly Data Library Annual Report of the Colombo Stock ExchangeSocial Media: CSE Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn pages CSE Android and iOS Mobile App Seminars and workshops conducted by the CSEBranches of the Colombo Stock Exchange:Matara, Kandy, Kurunegala, Negombo, Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Ambalantota and Ratnapura.Should you have any queries with regards to investment and if you wish to learn more about stock market investment contact our investor education team on 011-2356514.Courtesy: The Colombo Stock Exchange"

18 April 2021,Swarnamahal Financial Services: CB suspends business,"The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CB) has suspended the business of Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC (SFSP), in terms of Section 31(1) of the Finance Business Act, No. 42 of 2011 (FBA).The suspension came into effect from 5 p.m. on April 12. Excerpts of the media release of the Central Bank:Having considered the continuously deteriorating financial condition and non-availability of a viable revival plan, the Monetary Board suspended the business of SFSP and its parent Company ETI Finance Limited (ETIF) in terms of Section 31(1) of the FBA with effect from July 13, 2020 and the period of suspension of business activities was in effect until January 12, 2021.During the suspended period the Company failed to bring in an acceptable revival plan through a capital infusion even after expiry of almost six months from the date of suspension of the business activities and the financial position of SFSP continued to deteriorate further.During this period, a significant amount of dues to SFSP were collected mainly through gold loan recoveries and a number of depositors requested their remaining deposits to be repaid with such recoveries.The Monetary Board, in the public interest and in the interest of depositors, ordered SFSP to resume business notionally for a limited period of three months from January 13, 2021 under the supervision of the Panel of Management appointed by the Monetary Board, subject to specified strict conditions, only for the purpose of repayment up to 50 percent of remaining deposits.  Over Rs. 665  million has been paid to 94% of the remaining depositors under the repayment plan by the end of March 2021and the balance payments are also being processed by SFSP. In the meantime, the Monetary Board decided to increase the maximum compensation payment under the the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme (SLDILSS) from Rs. 600,000 to Rs. 1,100,000 by Rs. 500,000.This decision was taken to provide further relief to the depositors of financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the event of a cancellation or suspension of the licences of such institutions.Having considered the continuously deteriorating financial condition, intensifying the insolvent position of the Company and non-availability of a viable revival plan and the need to facilitate payments of increased compensation of Rs. 500,000 from SLDILSS to remaining depositors of SFSP without delay, the Monetary Board issued a Suspension Order on SFSP on April 12.During the suspension period, the Panel of Management will continue to manage the affairs of SFSP and the enhanced amount of compensation from SLDILSS to the remaining depositors of SFSP will be paid through the island wide branch network of Peoples’ Bank.The date of commencement of such compensation payment will be notified in the near future. Further regulatory action that will be taken on SFSP will be notified in due course. All debtors of SFSP are advised to pay their dues to SFSP on time, only through the bank accounts under the name of SFSP and maintain records of all payments to avoid any possible litigation against them for non-repayment of dues. Depositors, who have not yet received 30% of deposit repayments made in 2018 and 2019 and 50% repayment of remaining deposits made in 2021, have the ability to collect/receive their repayments during the suspended period of business of SFSP.For further clarifications contact: Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions  on 011 2477504 011 2398806 011 2398637. email -  [email protected]Resolution and Enforcement Department - 011 2477261 0112 398788.email - [email protected].Call centre, CBSL General inquiries 011 2477966.Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC / Panel of Management Inquiries regarding deposits, settlement of advances and other clarifications  - 011 7534800. email - [email protected]"
12 April 2020, Local biz leaders must take a cue from global corporate personalities," Sri Lanka should take a cue from business leaders and celebrities around the world who have volunteered to forgo their  salaries, perks and privileges  to support the battle against the deadly virus, retired former business personalities said.“Those who have extended a helping hand as founders and CEOs have set a precedent instead of ramming ‘make sacrifices’ down the throat of the employees,” a retired corporate personality said, adding that sacrifices should be made at a time when the world is going through a rough patch, but asking your subordinates who do not have the same luxury to bear the brunt is not fair.The management of certain top conglomerates in the country announced a series of cost cutting measures including pay cuts between 5 to 60 percent for executive cadre and board members last week.According to sources some of the executive cadre salaries are in the range of Rs. 50,000 leaving a take-home salary of around Rs. 40,000 after all deductions have been made.“The management of companies should look at ways and means of  cost saving rather than opting for easy way outs such as pay cuts and lay-offs which should be the last resort,” a former CEO of an export entity said. Some of the biggest names in the business world such as Jack Ma, the co-founder of Alibaba Group, Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and Bill Gates, the co-founder and co-chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have pledged contributions.Organisations that conduct business based on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) principle focus on social and environmental concerns just as they do on profits. The TBL posits that instead of one bottom line, there should be three: profit, people, and the planet.Jack Ma pledged $14 million through his Ma Foundation to help develop a coronavirus vaccine. He’s also donated 1.1 million testing kits, six million masks, and 60,000 protective suits and face shields to 54 African countries; 500,000 testing kits and one million face masks to the US; one million masks to Japan; and 1.8 million masks and 100,000 testing kits to Europe, including Italy and Spain.Brooklyn Nets owner and Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai has teamed up with the Chinese government to donate 1,000 ventilators to New York City.Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and founder of Square, is donating more than a quarter of his wealth for Covid-19 relief. Dorsey, on his Twitter feed, said he was moving $1 billion of his Square shares, or about 28% of his net worth, to Start Small LLC for pandemic relief.Bill Gates, co-chairman  and co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  has contributed $100 million through his foundation to aid global detection, isolation, and treatment of the virus.Celebrities too have been doing their part to help since the outbreak of the pandemic.Singer Elton John launched a $1 million coronavirus fund to protect people with HIV.Donatella Versace and daughter Allegra Versace pledged 200,000 euros to a hospital in Italy.Justin Timberlake donated to Mid-South Food Bank, located in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively said they’re donating $1 million to Feeding America and Food Banks Canada."

31 January 2021,"ECT, a private-partnership, not a sell-out - Amunugama","State Minister of Vehicle Regulation, Bus Transport Services and Train Compartments and Motor Car Industry Dilum Amunugama said certain sections are attempting to misinterpret the public-private partnership of the East Container Terminal (ECT) of the Colombo Port as a move to sell the ECT.The Hambantota Port deal of the former Yahapalana Government was a pure sale of the facility for 99 years and according to the agreement it can also be extended to another 99 years. However, the ECT is a partnership of 51 and 49 percent shares and it will continue for 35 years and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) will be the sole owner of it. Therefore, there would be no selling or leasing of a part of the ECT as claimed by certain sections, Amunugama told the Sunday Observer yesterday.“When somebody goes to the Stock Market and buys 49 percent of shares, he is not the owner. He is just the second shareholder. Obviously, the person who has 51 percent is the owner. The same thing applies to the ECT as well,” he said.Amunugama said those who maintain that the Government should not go for this partnership to develop the ECT, should understand the difference between a sale and a lease for 99 years. There is a huge difference between a 99-year lease and a partnership for 35 years. Obviously, the Government should take a final decision whether we should develop the ECT or not.He said that it was clearly said by the relevant Minister that this will be a public-private partnership with 51 and 49 percent shares of the ECT. However, if the trade unions and the whole country say we should roll back this decision then that is also possible.The former Yahapalana Government had taken a policy decision to sign a MoU for a public-private partnership to develop the ECT. Therefore, a decision has to be taken whether we should follow this stance or otherwise. If we want to develop the ECT, definitely we have to go for a partnership as the Government doesn’t have sufficient funds to develop it right now, he added."
8 November 2020,"Plantations, a top forex earner - Kumar Dharmasena","The plantation sector will be one of the best foreign earning businesses in Sri Lanka bringing in the much needed foreign exchange to boost the economy, said former Sri Lanka cricketer and current ICC elite panel umpire Kumar Dharmasena.Dharmasena has ventured into his familiar turf with the launch of the first branch of his company, Pintenna Plantations in Galle recently with much optimism of great prospects despite the gloom of the current global environment.He said there is a huge market opportunity for oud oil aka liquid gold which is in short supply in the market at present.Pintanna Plantations Company is now coming into the market and offering the investment product, trees which are already grown and physically existing in the estate.“This is the first stage of our business plan. Thereafter, our oil factory will be expanded with new technology to enhance the quality of the product during the next five years,” he said.Pintanna Plantations (Pvt) Ltd will offer Agarwood trees to prospective investors. Three investment plans were unveiled where a minimum return is guaranteed.He said that the field of plantations is not new to him. “I have been in this sector for decades planting Agarwood trees for the past eleven years. Oud oil is extracted from the agarwood tree by using the water distillery system and is a fine product for the export market.Expansion“My dream is to expand the business and increase business volume. There is a huge market opportunity for the business.I have thought of using my leisure time to expand the existing business operation specially during the Covid-19 pandemic period,” said Dharmasena, a nature lover since childhood.He said he used to visit his family estate whenever he came back to Sri Lanka after an overseas cricket tour.“Initially the estate comprised tea, rubber, cinnamon and spices and thereafter, we moved into planting agarwood having studied its value.He said the pandemic is a blessing in disguise to plan and launch this venture.Investors could enhance their return through our investment product specially during the low interest rate regime.“I have a professional management and marketing team; they manage the company based on the plans. I have to only do the overall supervision.Therefore, I know that cricket and business could be managed properly,” he said.EnthusiasmAt present, there are over 13,000 trees known by its native name Vallapatta spanning over 139 acres in the Ratnapura district.A product of Nalanda College, Dharmasena rose to fame being a favourite of the Sri Lanka team and then an elite umpire. Continuing the same enthusiasm he had for the sport from childhood he took his interests deep into the heart of the country as a planter of trees that would generate a return that would bring foreign exchange to the country.Dharmasena was a member of the Sri Lanka team that clinched the 1996 Cricket World Cup. "

At Group level, PBT and PAT were at Rs. 5.9 bn and Rs. 4.8 bn. The substantial monetary loosening adopted to revive the pandemic hit economy resulted in AWPLR dropping by nearly 400 bps over the past 12 months. This resulted in the interest income decreasing by 13% YoY to Rs. 23.7 Bn. Interest expenses too exhibited a decline of 17.2% YoY to Rs. 13.1 bn driven by strong CASA (current accounts and savings accounts) mobilization.The CASA ratio improved from 36.2% in March 2020 to 39.7% by the end of Q1 2021 as the CASA base grew by 30% YoY to Rs. 395 Bn. As a result, the Bank’s Net Interest Income (NII) for the first three months 2021 decreased by 7.2% YoY to Rs. 10.6 Bn.Net Fee and Commission income for the first quarter grew by 10.2% YoY to Rs. 2.3 bn as business activity rebounded during the period. The Credit Cards business, Trade and Remittances which constitute a major share of fees performed well despite restrictions on imports continuing to be in place. Other fee sources, which also encompass digital business lines rose by 24.4% YoY.Exchange rate volatility and movements during the period, led to substantial revaluation gains on swaps and forward agreements. Swap costs were also lower relative to the corresponding quarter of 2020 as swap premiums declined in line with Dollar interest rates. Accordingly, the Bank recorded a net exchange gain of Rs. 1.9 bn which was a 53% YoY improvement compared to Q1 2020. The total dividend income from investments for Q1 2021 was Rs. 421Mn compared to Rs. 13Mn in the corresponding period of 2020, as dividends declared for the financial year 2019 were paid only in Q2 2020 due to the pandemic. NPA ratio of the Bank improved marginally to 4.28% as at end of Q1 2021 compared to 4.31% as at end December 2020, as majority of customers who were previously under moratorium commenced repayments since October 2020.The impairment charge for the quarter ended 31st March 2021 was Rs. 2.7 bn in comparison to Rs. 4.7 bn recorded for Q1 2020.  The impairment for Q1 2020 included a charge of Rs. 708 mn on account of sovereign bonds mainly as a result of the sovereign downgrade that was affected in April 2020.Profit Before Taxes (PBT) amounted to Rs. 5.5 bn and was subjected to the reduced income tax charge of 24% in comparison to the 28% tax charge that was applicable previously. Accordingly, the profit after tax for the Bank improved to Rs. 4.7 bn by 78% during Q1 2021. The Bank’s assets crossed Rs. 1.3 trillion as at quarter end with the gross loan book at Rs. 808.3 bn.

13 December 2020,Take a cue from Asian giants to reach upper income status - Don,"Sri Lanka will need to put its best foot forward to be innovative and produce what the country needs and maintain an economic growth rate between 6-7 percent if the country is to achieve a high standard of living and prosperity for its citizens, said University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Head of Department and Senior Professor of Finance, Harendra  Dissabandara said.He said since mid last year Sri Lanka has been an upper middle income country among a few countries in Asia with a USD 4,000 per capita income. “Our next hurdle is to achieve the USD 12,000 per capita income target to be an upper income country for which we need to increase the per capita income level by USD 8,000 to bridge the shortfall which is not an easy task as China is in the USD 8,000 per capita income level even with a 9-11 percent annual economic growth rate,” Prof.Bandara said, adding that having recorded between 2-3 percent economic growth rate in the past two years simply utilizing the country’s human resource is not enough to achieve that feat.He said there has to be major investments in key economic sectors which will drive growth.  Sri Lanka recorded low investments in recent years and attracting investments from diverse sources is not a cakewalk. The capital market comes handy and is one of the best sources to boost investments for the country.“The Bond and  Unit trust  markets should be used for this. Sri Lanka boasts of having an over 100-year stock market but the question is have we made use of it,” he said, adding that learning about it alone is not adequate. Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia record over 200 percent of its GDP from the capital market whereas it is around 20 percent in Sri Lanka.He said it is not enough to diversify the market but that it should be integrated into the economy. “We need to be focused and have clear strategies on the GDP growth target by 2025 and 2030, what would be the short, medium and long term targets and how are we to achieve them. “As Malaysia consistently went on with its 10 strategy for over 50 years and China its 13th strategy for 65 years we need clear and consistent policies to achieve higher growth.However, as analysts and think tanks have been insisting achieving growth depends on the implementation of the policies and budgetary promises.The planned growth target of six percent and above from next year needs a realistic and pragmatic approach to boost revenue which is currently on deficit.According to the IMF, the Asian economy will contract -2.2% this year while the Central Bank predicts -1.7% contraction of the Sri Lankan economy in the same year and expects recovery from mid-2021. Economic analysts are of the view with no sign of an early normalisation and global economic recovery having lofty goals is not realistic.  The Government’s medium-term vision is to reduce the budget gap by increasing the economic growth up to 6 percent and increasing government revenue from  9.7 percent to 14.1 percent. However, analysts said that government’s revenue targets are also unrealistic, because of slow economic activities and import restrictions."
4 February 2021,Rebuilding the Business Landscape in a Post-Covid Era,"The year 2020 has no doubt been, and will probably continue to be known as one of the most challenging years that this century has ever faced and this too, not only for all Sri Lankans but globally as well. From around the end of 2019 and upto now, the world gradually got acquainted with the Covid-19 pandemic and begun to deal with its aftermath in one way or another. Amongst those that have been greatly affected, were the business communities, small and large alike. Businesses have suffered and continue to face many hurdles while trying to remain afloat. With a brand new year just around the corner, businesses can once again look forward to growth and change. In order to move past these hurdles and recover from the remnants of the pandemic, businesses should begin to look into a few areas that could help towards bringing about a more optimistic outlook to running a business in this day and age.Harnessing an Entrepreneurial MindsetPerspective from both sides; that of the business owner and the customer, evolve over time. Businesses had learnt to look at their establishments from a consumer lens and aim to create a more customer-centric approach to doing business. With the onset of the pandemic, many companies and service providers adapted to the situation. When the lockdown occurred, many businesses that probably did not offer delivery services at one point, began to deliver goods and produce to their customers and many small scale and even some large scale businesses that were not accustomed to the practice, embraced it and went along with it.When obstacles in the business world emerge, business owners and those involved need to have an open mind and invite ideas and innovation that would support the creation of more sustainable results. Embracing an entrepreneurial mindset is about creating a business with purpose as well as forming a path towards adapting to that situation at hand in an effective manner.Large scale companies on one hand, follow best practices where they learn from a crisis situation, where they have these findings documented and eventually, are absorbed into their planning processes in the long run. They have their contingency plan prepared.When the second covid-19 wave arrived, however, small businesses were hit even harder as many of these establishments might not have anticipated such an outcome second time round. So, small and medium scale businesses should begin to put their learning to practice. From a marketing point of view, consumer behaviour has changed following the pandemic. Today, they tend to focus on gaining more value from their transaction when compared to how they shopped pre-covid. Consumers would want to know how you, as a business entity, can help them solve a problem. It is important now that more focus is projected towards identifying customer pain points and working to establish solid solutions for those. One can also embrace this situation as a catalyst for change in a way. So, the point to be considered is to take another look at consumer behaviour.Post-Covid Behavioural, Organisational and Social ChangesWith the world moving forward in the midst of a pandemic, we need to look at the prospect of embracing behavioural, organisational and social changes that have taken shape since the pandemic struck. In terms of organisational and behavioural change, businesses would need to focus on the aspect of trust when it comes to their employees and workforce. This topic would largely focus on employees who have shifted from their offices to working from home. Once again, the pandemic managed to disrupt our work processes in such a way, that many businesses and employees have rediscovered their work trajectories from an entirely new perspective. At one point, an office framework meant that employees were visible, interaction was easier and leaders/managers were able to make contact easily with their employees. Now, the work-from-home aspect only allows for the work outcome to be seen.So, not only do organisations need to trust their employees to do their jobs but employees on the other hand, would need to make sure that they are trustworthy among their superiors. So, this element of trust today, has become even more valuable than ever. Hiring practices would also face many changes so, organisations should be ready to adapt to the many changes that may emerge in the process. For instance, one sector that has been heavily stressed out from these recent changes, is the IT sector. With the pandemic having had pretty much paved the way for a more online presence, the IT sector would not have expected this type of demand where entities such as education, communication and videoconferencing, etc. have all progressively shifted online.So, the pressure on the IT sector is definitely greater than it has ever been. Therefore, these sectors need to take another look into their business models and project future changes into their practices. In terms of social changes, not only have businesses been affected but so has that of the general public. From a marketing point of view, marketing budgets should not be completely overlooked in favour of the current situation, but should continue to engage in instigating marketing strategies that would ensure their product or brand is still out there in the market. The way marketing is done could go through changes in tandem with the target market and the current economic climate, but it should not come to a complete halt or linger on a zero budget. The business should continue to build on their pipeline.An Ideal Climate to Advance InclusivityThere was a time when working mothers ended up sacrificing their careers so that they can stay home and focus on their children, spouses and households. Today, at-home mothers have an opportunity of working from home. Organisations now, have an even better opportunity to practice inclusivity and equal opportunity and to exploit this paradigm shift. At the same time, individuals who bear the brunt of facing social challenges can also receive a chance to be based at home and work for an organisation that easily adapts to such change. Such individuals could be those who are differently-abled, persons from LGBTQI communities who many a timeface difficulties in securing traditional office jobs simply because of the way they look or sexual orientation and even senior persons and retirees who are still capable of working.So, with each passing year, economies grow, obstacles and challenges come and go and businesses adapt and evolve. The year 2021 will no doubt herald a time of unique adaptability for Sri Lankan businesses across all major and minor sectors. The best way forward is to continue to learn from the moment, find solutions to lingering issues and to keep going forward. "

7 March 2021,Which investor profile describes you best? ,"(Part 4 appeared last week)Financial professionals who manage investments on behalf of clients, profile their clients according to the way they perceive the client’s willingness to take risks with funds invested. Conservative risk profile: Aims for capital protection - takes very low risk Your primary investment objective is to preserve your capital which is essentially the principal amount you have invested and to earn a predictable flow of income from your assets. This means you find it more reassuring to invest in products with fixed maturities and predetermined returns. Defensive or moderate risk profile: Aims for gradual capital growth - takes low risk Your principal investment aim is to gain a relatively stable and regular income. You are willing to take a moderate level of risk with assets you invest in. You aim to gradually increase the value of your portfolio over time.Balanced risk profile: Seeks a balance between risk and returnYour main aim is to achieve capital growth over the long term. You seek relatively stable returns, but do not mind taking moderate risks. Nevertheless, you expect your asset to generate a nominal income. Dynamic risk profile: Seeks long-term growth potential You seek to grow the value of your portfolio over a long-term period. With the willingness to take a higher risk you intend to attract higher returns.You are also aware of the short-term fluctuations in share prices and consider its temporary fall as a buying opportunity. In this case earning a stable income through an investment is of limited importance.Growth or aggressive risk profile: On a determined quest for growth Your priority is to generate capital gains. You are not afraid of speculating or going into what can be considered as risky economic sectors. You see a temporary market fall/setback as a buying opportunity. Factors that affect a decision to sell shares    For many investors deciding to sell their shares can be more difficult than buying. There are many personal and market driven factors that can lead to a sell decision, including the risk profiles. Some factors to be considered are as given below:The shares are no longer a good fit for your investment goals and risk tolerance This might happen because your goals have changed over time. Sometimes an investor may find that the company he/ she invested in does not appeal to him or her as a good investment any longer. This would mean that you would systematically start selling the shares that were intended to grow to the financial goal you had planned.Reinvestment opportunities This is when you have identified a company that offers better returns than of the shares you currently hold. You can sell less advantageous shares in order to reinvest the funds in a better performing stock.It is important to consider how your new purchase will fit into the rest of your portfolio and your strategies of investment. Price movements If a share price suddenly falls beyond a certain acceptable percentage, some investors consider this a ‘sell’ point, in order to eliminate the possibility of further losses. Keep in mind that you may need to have observed the price movements of a share and have some idea of the share’s volatility to identify an untoward fall in the price. Overvalued shares You may plan to sell shares when they are pushed way past their true value. A share is considered overvalued if its current price is not justified by its earnings outlook and is therefore, expected to drop.Overvaluation may result from an emotional buying spurt, which inflates the stocks’ market price, or from deterioration in a company’s financial strength. Courtesy: The Colombo Stock Exchange"
5 September 2021,Importance of branding for SME growth,"A decade ago, branding was defined as a name, slogan, sign, symbol, colour, design, or a combination of these elements that distinguishes a company, product, or service; to stand out from another company that has competitive products or services. Branding is important for small and medium scale businesses as much as for larger companies as it influences all aspects of a business.More recognitionBranding helps businesses gain better recognition. A business with strong branding would attract more attention from the public rather than a business without branding. A business lacking cohesive branding would not stay in a person’s mind for long.According to research data, a business with a distinct logo, attractive colours and other visual elements would become more memorable. The brand might be visible only briefly in the media. However, if it sticks out attractively in a passing moment, chances are that viewers would remember it even though they may not be ready to use the product or service. Eventually, when they have the need for the product or service, they would recall the brand and seek you out.Trust buildingThe strength of a business mainly lies on trust from target customers, and this is not an easy task. However, it would be harder for a business to gain trust when it lacks the key features of branding. Without branding, it is impossible to differentiate a product or service from competitors.Branding helps to show potential customers that the business is well established and credible. This is a mode to communicate the values and goals of the business, and what customers can expect from it.This is an investment for the business to improve, and potential customers are bound to value the investment you made to create your brand.Creating loyal customersIn many ways, branding can appeal to people’s emotions making them feel more connected to the company. Branding helps to build relations with customers, eventually leading to loyal customers. Customer loyalty goes beyond ensuring customer satisfaction. It is the transformation of a customer into a brand advocate which is one of the main goals of a business.Inspiring employeesA company with good branding will make employees feel that they’re engaged in something more than a mere job. Branding can motivate employees by creating a sense of unity and giving them better direction. The company would have happier employees who would become more productive, giving better results.Improving advertisingBranding and advertising go hand-in-hand. It is imperative to create a good brand first. An effective advertising campaign needs solid branding.Without this, the business would miss out on many opportunities during a campaign. Incorporating branding into advertising will help increase brand recognition, while cohesively representing the business’ identity and values.However, many small businesses make the mistake of overlooking branding as they view themselves as a business rather than a brand. Branding could receive less priority amid the day-to-day running of businesses.It is much easier for small-scale businesses to keep branding aside considering its long-term commitments and challenges in measuring impact in the short run, and address immediate and more pressing business concerns. However, branding has always been a vital part of business. Hence, investing time and resources to develop the brand is crucial to achieve long-term success.According to Accenture, 66% of consumers say that a brand’s culture and transparency attract them to buy a certain product, and 62% of respondents want the companies to stand up for issues they are passionate about. This illustrates the impact of strong branding.A brand has the potential to say many things about a company: its products or services, customer relations, employee relations, the promises it makes, the promises it keeps, its values, and even societal goals.Branding amid Covid-19Branding is more important now more than ever due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Amid the chaos and uncertainty, only the nimble and flexible have the greatest hope for survival. At this point in time, it is vital that businesses have a brand with an online presence, which would help customers to reach out easily through social media or other online platforms.The Covid-19 pandemic has eliminated most conventional businesses who were unable to adjust to the current situation. Companies which had invested in branding and were flexible to change business models gained exponential growth amid the pandemic.Current research indicates that it is important for brands to craft advertising to focus on how businesses can help people cope with the situation.The Edelman Trust Barometer Special Report (a survey done with 12,000 respondents) revealed that “84% of the respondents want brand advertising to focus on how brands help them to cope with pandemic-related challenges.”Due to social media, consumers become exposed to new brands every day.This is advantageous to consumers with the availability of many options and the ability to weigh the pros and cons with research to settle on the best brand. However, it is harder for businesses due to the increased competition and the fight to retain market share. Therefore, businesses need to go that extra mile to ensure that they stand out in a crowd. To do this, businesses should invest in creating a strong brand that would attract attention. With the right branding, you can get some control over how people perceive your business. Therefore, it is paramount that businesses don’t overlook this."

28 March 2021,Post pandemic brand strategy,"All temporary fixes to stop the bleeding have been done and now you need to think beyond for real recovery and growth.We have all changed the way we operate during the Covid-19 crisis.Some changes were forced on us; others represent the height of innovation in a crisis. For the majority, the business impact of the pandemic has been negative; for some, positive.The pandemic may have wiped your brand strategy slate clean but you have also garnered invaluable experience. Now it’s time to bring together your management team and use those lessons to reconfigure your business and operating models for a new reality including your most important brand positioning.Questing the health of your brand in the new normal world is critical in a new driven world. For some, the pandemic has stressed business and operating models to the point of breaking. Organisations will ultimately reduce or retire those activities permanently. What will your future be? This crisis has created an opportunity to reset some of your brand goals and ambitions; it’s time to ask: “As we recover from this crisis, do we want the brand to be different — and if so, how?” Brand marketing Though it may seem counterintuitive, now is the time to hold steady to ensure a strong come back within your brand marketing after Covid-19. Great opportunities will surface as businesses withdraw themselves.If your business can maintain a long-term brand marketing strategy, it’s going to make a huge impact on your business strategy after the crisis. Your team should start making adjustments, to make your digital brand marketing efforts effective. The response to the shift in searches, competitors, and market share is already dire. Allocate decent budgets Most companies took the easy route by cutting branding budgets – quite rightly so but you need to now think of long-term growth by competing for mind share.  The competitor market has changed. Many businesses are responding to these changes in drastic ways, some by cutting their marketing budgets altogether. Though it may not make sense right away, holding brand building budgets is the recommended move. Sticking to the same brand positioning strategy and targets will not work for your brand after Covid-19.Conditions will continue to shift, hence the brand value proposition needs to be dynamic. Brands and companies should plan to redesign their game plan. They should develop continuous experimentation within the key practices of brand communication. Digital marketing teams must change their media plans and campaign calendar as soon as possible to prepare for the reactivating and reengaging their customers. The priority of all future campaigns must be boosting lifetime value and customer experience, as well as delivering a purpose-driven and meaningful brand.Time to evolveIf the world is shifting and evolving, so should your brand. If your target audience’s priorities have changed, so must your marketing. If your potential customer’s perceptions have altered, even the slightest, so should your marketing.As 2021 continues to throw its hardest punches, many consumers turn to their favorite brands for direction and solace. This is when your voice as a marketer matters most. No one knows the long-term ripple effects these events will have on the world, but marketers can choose how to respond and how to represent their brand.The more traditional marketing tactics might not be enough. More than ever, consumers are looking for authenticity, empathy and solutions. Does your brand strategy cater to your target audience’s new needs? If not, it’s time to evolve.To meet the needs of consumers as we enter a time of recovery, marketers everywhere will need to get back to the drawing board. Reevaluate their ideal buyer persona. How do your brand communications need to change to meet your ideal customer’s new needs?Looking at challenges through a strategic brand marketing lens will help optimise each and every brand marketing strategy used throughout the buyer’s journey to ensure your brand resonates at every touch point. At the end of the day it’s all about being relatable, empathetic and authentic, irrespective of what’s happening in the world around us."
12 June 2021,CSE and GRI to host “Preparing a Sustainability Report” - Batch 2,"Following the success of the first batch of Technical series 2019-2020, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in collaboration with Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is organising the second batch of the Technical Series titled “Preparing a Sustainability Report” from 10.30 a.m. to 12 noon from June 15-22.The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an independent international standard-setting organization that helps businesses and governments worldwide understand and communicate their impact on critical sustainability issues such as climate change, human rights, governance and social well-being.GRI pioneered sustainability reporting in the late 1990’s and has since become the globally accepted standard for enabling business, governments and other organizations to understand and communicate their impacts on critical sustainability issues. Today the framework is being used by governments, financial regulators, capital markets, businesses in more than 100 countries around the world. GRI has also been working very closely with the UN to move businesses to report clearly on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  While Sri Lanka does not have a regulation that mandates sustainability reporting, the practice is encouraged by the voluntary adoption under the Code of Best Practice on Corporate Governance issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CASL) together with The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka(SEC). GRI South Asia in collaboration with CSE actively engaged with listed companies through a series of workshops, sessions and virtual roundtables. As a result, we have seen 5 times rise in sustainability reporting and a six-fold rise in GRI reports among the listed companies (from 2013 to 2019).  Furthermore, it has been established that reporting on impacts using GRI, helps organizations better anticipate risk, and develop strategy for long term sustainability of the business. CSE in collaboration with GRI, launched the ESG Guidance document titled ‘Communicating Sustainability: Six Recommendations for Listed Companies Version 02’. The Technical Series will refer to this publication and several other GRI resources and tools to support participating companies to prepare a GRI Standard based report.  In addition to this we will also invite practitioners and experts from various organisations to share their perspectives, tips, experience and expectations from reporters.In this high value, professional workshop, we will discover why it makes business sense to adopt sustainable business practices, how to monitor, manage and communicate on your performance.The workshop will be facilitated by GRI South Asia. In addition to GRI and CSE, external experts are also invited to share their perspectives and experience from DNV, Ernst & Young, KPMG and invited speakers from Listed companies in Sri Lanka. It is an ideal opportunity for listed companies to start their reporting journey. The Technical Series is exclusive for Listed companies and large companies in Sri Lanka (Manager and above) from diverse department who would contribute to preparing the sustainability report of the organization (e.g.: CSR or sustainable development department of the company, HR, Communication, Finance, Operation, Corporate Planning, Risk, Health and Safety). No prior knowledge on CSR or Sustainability is required for attending the series. This is a three-part workshop series."
28 February 2021,Dealing with liars in the workplace,"With the cut throat competition compounded by Covid-19 and the economic downturn and its consequences, survival has become even harder forcing people to resort to unsustainable – unethical acts.People lie when they don’t have solutions. Your leaders and employees lie too, and it’s costing businesses an enormous amount of money. Most of your stakeholders lie too as a natural tendency and a survival tactic.What can you do to protect your business by putting in place measures to ensure that employees do not have to lie and if and when they lie they are exposed? Lets focus on employees this time.Employees lie for many reasons; to cover up for their poor performance or lapses, to mask behavioural misalignment, to overcome internal competition and for petty advantages such as winning the boss over. There’s a pretty good probability that you have someone on your staff who will try to use lying and deception to demonstrate that his or her performance is superlative.These people are often masters at manipulation, as most likely they may have been honing their skills since childhood. You need to make sure you are looking at actual performance and not what is coming out of someone’s mouth in terms of claims. Sometimes bad things happen in business.Mistakes happen. They’ve happened in all businesses in the past and will happen in all businesses in the future. What you want, though, is to know when mistakes happen, so that you can fix them.When you punish people for mistakes or for informing you about these mistakes, their inclination is to lie about things and hide them from you. Sometimes this works out and they are able to fix whatever happened on their own, but sometimes the problem gets worse.Little white lies keep things calm and pleasant, but do too many of them and people stop believing you. When they stop believing you, they’ll stop seeing the reason to be honest with you. You’ll lose their trust and your own ability to sort out the truth.Body languageIt’s useful to have some knowledge on how to spot a liar; however, the old adage that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing is certainly applicable here. While it’s fun and useful to know the warning signs, it’s also important to realize that it’s easy to make mistakes.The science of ‘lie spotting’ is a good weapon for trained law enforcement personnel and psychologists, but it can be a dangerous tool in the hands of amateurs. Lie spotting comes with experience, instinct and power of observation.Watching and understanding the inherent behaviour of each individual in different situations for a reasonable period of time will help acquire and build this skill to be accurate at most times. Developing the ability to read and interpret the body language of people is a talent most good leaders need.As a leader you need to be fair and a good listener and provide space for flexibility and have more patience. Not doing so will attract its own negative repercussions. Create a culture of honestyFairness in the workplace is the top prerequisite for creating a good place to work. In addition you need honesty, respect, fair wages, appreciation, recognition for work well done, clear job descriptions and lack of favoritism, to name a few.In short, if you create a culture of caring, your employees are more likely to respond truthfully, and in kind.While managers and business owners sometimes need to push people to give their best for the success of the business, research shows that people resort to lying when they’re stretched beyond the limit.Setting unrealistic goals and impossibly high standards, continuously demanding faster and better results, setting constant deadlines and expecting unreasonable work hours can overwhelm people and force them to lie about their work in order to avoid problems and protect their jobs.If this is your style of leadership, know the perils that come with it. But the commitment to the job and loyalty to the organization are the least expectations from a performer and there is no excuse for non-delivery of performance at the agreed level. Some employees lie as a habit and we all have experience with such individuals. Remember that, as a leader, you are always in a glass house. People get their cues from you. Guard against espousing values that you don’t honour, every day, in every action. For example, don’t say, “Customers come first,” then treat customers poorly when you’re having a bad day. Everything counts when you are a leader.Honesty is often not given the credit it deserves among employees.  An honest employee’s credibility and integrity speaks for itself, allowing that person increased opportunities, and greater flexibility within the business, since the honest employee has proven his or herself.Even if it seems as though lying will make life easier – especially in a situation where punishment could be a risk, or where a customer is upset – it will more frequently only make things more complicated. If you an employee remove lying from your system completely from your list of dependencies and be determined to depend on your ability to deliver if you are serious about accelerated career progress."
8 August 2021,Aelian enters the fray to lift basketball,"The sport of basketball is competed at an intense speed and has gained immense popularity to be listed among the top five sports in the World. But the situation in Sri Lanka is vice versa and unfortunately it has been sidelined as an orphan, without any active progress.Those who intend to serve in the governing body are merely power hungry rather than developing the game with a proper executed plan. Over the past few years it has been a barren sheet with regard to activities and tournaments which ultimately placed the sport in disarray.Sports Minister Namal Rajapaksa too was very concerned over the basketball association and finally, the aspirations of the stakeholders and basketball loving public were fulfilled as a gigantic and a visionary leader Aelian Gunawardene volunteered to take over the task to rejuvenate this organization.Aelian, himself was a profound basketball player who hailed from S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia. A top professional businessman in the Mercantile sector who is the founder of JAT Holdings and currently serving as its Managing Director, showed his willingness to take over as the sport’s head to lift the standard of the game to great heights.Aelian was fully focused and pumped up for the task with the assistance of his colleagues and disclosed his plans to the Sunday Observer.Excerpts of the interview with Aelian Gunawardene:Q: We know you have driven a company to great heights listed in the local stock market. But your new assignment is a different one. How can you manage to spare time for basketball?A: I am blessed with a fantastic team at JAT, led very efficiently by our CEO, which allows me a bit of time to invest in a sport that I am very passionate about. We also have a similar setup in place for Sri Lanka Basketball. Our CEO Asanga Amaratunga is a past President of the SLBF and has the knowledge and experience to run the FIBA Plus program that Sri Lanka Basketball has approved in our medium term plan to improve the state of basketball in our country. We also have a great Senior Vice President, seven Vice Presidents, a dedicated Secretary General and an Exco. Now it is a matter of getting these teams to work towards one goal as a united Federation.Q: As all are aware basketball at present is in a pathetic state. How confident are you that you will be able to put things back on track?A: Basketball is in a stage of transition. It is unfortunate that all sports have suffered in Sri Lanka due to the inability to hold local competitions. We have requested the Ministries of Sport, Health and Education for clear guidelines so that we could start with our plans immediately. I have obtained tremendous support from the Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, DG Sports Amal Edirisooriya and the Sports Council and also the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army and his office to conduct my duties so far and look forward to the other Ministries also assisting us where possible.I have no doubts that we would make a significant improvement to the system. We are a new team at Sri Lanka Basketball and are looking forward and not concerned about the past.Q: The grass route level are the schools. But it is evident that hardly any tournament has been conducted in the past two years. What are your plans to address this area?A: As mentioned we have requested the Health and Education Ministries to grant us the approval to play basketball at school level and even restart the under 13 tournaments as we did in the past. On receipt of this approval we would launch a new academy structure for school kids. Everyone involved understands the importance of these tournaments going ahead and are working together to achieve this.Q: The talk in basketball circles is that even now there are some corrupt people serving in the system. What do you think about them?A: I do not wish to comment on rumours or speculation. However, I can assure you that we are putting in multiple processes in place to improve areas such as player selection, training, tournaments and management. We have also taken steps to ensure financial accountability such as having EY appointed as auditors to the SLBF. Most selection related issues were exacerbated due to the Covid situation and the lack of time to run the correct processes. However we are confident that we will be able to overcome these issues in the future by improving the system and making things transparent. We have also introduced a code of conduct which will be signed by all coaches, referees, players and the Sri Lanka Basketball Executive Committee.Q: The Sports Minister and the basketball fraternity have hopes that you are the right choice to perform a job and transform the game to next level. Are you capable of delivering it”A: As the Founder and Managing Director of JAT which is a Company that we just listed on the Sri Lanka Stock market last month, I believe that I am up to the task of transforming Sri Lanka Basketball. However, one is only as good as one’s team. I am therefore very conscious of making sure that we have the right team with the right attitude and dedication in place. FIBA International too has come on board to back us as they are happy to see that we are putting our house in order.Q: By now you would have done a feasibility study on the system. Where do you think things have gone wrong?A: I believe that while most involved in the sport had good intentions, they worked in different silos, which obviously causes disconnect. SLBF did not also have specific, measurable and achievable goals set, which we are doing.Q: What are your immediate, mid and long term plans to rejuvenate the game?A: FIBA International together with our Exco have drawn up a detailed plan called the FIBA Plus program, which includes Good Governance, Administration, Income Generation and Growing the Game in Sri Lanka. Running this successfully is our mid-term plan. We unfortunately do not have a home court for Sri Lanka Basketball nor do we have the right facilities. We have arranged to get all this done within the next few months. The DG of Sports Amal Edirisooriya and the Sports Council headed by Mahela Jayawardena have been inspirational and extremely supportive, which I am so grateful for. Further, Yaswant Muttetuwegama and Kasturi Wilson both National basketball players who are on the Sports Council, have also supported me tremendously.We have interviewed several Foreign Technical Directors out of which we would select the best candidate and make sure he improves the Coaching, Strength and Skill aspects and bring in Technology to the sport of basketball. World sport today is very different to what it was five years ago and we in Sri Lanka need to move with the times and adopt Technology which we will bring in.Q: We know that there is a big need for funds to run the game. How will you manage to overcome this situation?A: Unfortunately, only a few Sri Lankan companies back sport in general. It is the same few companies such as Dialog, MAS, Brandix, SLT and JAT that have done so in the past. However we are confident that with the right people managing basketball that there will be several other individuals and companies volunteering to support us. I have already got a few calls offering support and together with the assistance of the Ministry of Sports and FIBA, we can achieve the budgets we have set out. I am also very pleased to see how our Vice Presidents in charge of different aspects of the game have put their hands up and finances to help the sport and develop it. A special mention should go out to Dr. Gehan De Soysa in charge of 3x3 Basketball and Ashok Jeyakumar in charge of District development.Q: What are your plans to resume the local tournament?A: I am currently working with the rest of the SLBF team to develop an in-depth plan to resume local tournaments.Q: Right now you don’t have a permanent sponsor, court and an office to run your own tournaments and activities. Do you have any plans to overcome this issue?A: We are thankful to SLT Mobitel for confirming that they would act as one of our sponsors. We have also spoken to several other organisations and individuals who have a passion for the sport who have readily confirmed that they would come on board to assist us with sponsorships. Needless to say, JAT Holdings will be a significant sponsor of Sri Lanka Basketball as well. Under the FIBA Plus program, one of the four aspects is Administration and to do this effectively, SLBF is redoing our office and has hired a CEO and two assistants to run the program. Further, SLBF would also appoint a District Coordinator per district to work with the development committee and the CEO.Q: What do you think about the talent in the country and where are we lacking?A: While Sri Lankans by nature are smaller than players in some countries that produce taller and larger players, we possess the speed that is required for the game. I feel with our Foreign Technical Director coming in we would be in a position to improve our shooting and make use of the size we have and also attract better talent to the sport. We have a great community of young players who are ready to put in the time and effort to improve not just their skills but their physique to be able to compete at an international level.Q: What are your plans to take the game to rural areas and island wide?A: We have a detailed program under the CEO and the Vice President in charge of district development to grow the game by improving baseball at school and club levels in all districts of the country.Q: Do you have any specific vision for the upliftment of the game?A: I want to inculcate the love for the game in our young players. We believe with the FIBA Plus program all aspects of the sport will be improved, not just player performance and management.Q: Finally, what is your message you would like to send out to the stakeholders and to the basketball loving public?A: It is with humility and honour that I have taken the role of President of Sri Lanka Basketball and intend to improve the perception of the sport in Sri Lanka. It is one of the most popular games in the world and one that we need to expand in our country.I assure all basketball loving Sri Lankans based locally and abroad that we would do our very best to produce the best teams Sri Lanka can showcase and look forward to your support. We invite any Sri Lankan who feels they could either contribute by playing for the country or in any other form even though they live abroad to contact us and express their willingness to join. I want to tell them please do not hesitate to call or write to me if you would like to discuss any matter in relation to the game. "
21 March 2021,IT roadmap for Sri Lanka,"During the past decades, information technology has gained its utmost level of success all around the world. Sri Lanka is still struggling to cater to the needs of local and foreign entities. Many IT organisations are making an excellent effort to bring out IT solutions for business needs. Some are successful, while some fail to come up with long-term stable solutions.When considering IT education and entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka, about ninety percent of the students who pass out of the universities opt to serve an employer other than starting their own business with their own ideas. Some end up making business deals for IT solutions with international companies, and some fail to grab  employment opportunities in the area they studied.Around  ten percent of the students who select the path to be an IT employer or an entrepreneur also fail to cater to international business needs, and among them, only 10% of the students will be successful in their business. To mitigate these kinds of issues, we need to get government parties in direct collaboration to set up rules and regulations for standards when someone starts a business in IT. It is better to work for an employer other than going for a company that will fail. If you invest in a failure, your investments will be lost. Currently, government bodies are reluctant to provide a proper guideline for these.The reasons for frequent failures are the lack of knowledge on how they should address their customers and how to impress them with their capabilities and fail to protect technical assets they are having (employees), most importantly.Most promisingly, almost in every case, lack of knowledge plays a significant role here. Either you, your son, your daughter or a relative of yours is an IT undergraduate or a student who passed out of the university still may not have a good understanding about what kind of a job they should select to get the maximum possible benefit of what they have learned in the university.For example, if we take a student who has been raised in a village and having completed his or her degree and passed out with a class but still due to lack of contacts and lack of knowledge, he or she might end up joining a company which is underpaid or select a role that will not improve his or her capabilities.The main reason for the unemployment of IT graduates is the lack of knowledge about the companies operating in Sri Lanka. Candidates have significantly less understanding of what stream they should select when it comes to their first job. There are many streams one can choose from when you have a general IT degree. Some end up working in a company on a low salary, and they never know that their skills are underestimated. In such cases, recruiters and business owners get the maximum benefit from them.Many foreign IT organisations operate their HQs in Sri Lanka. For example, if we take  Orion City, IT park, there are a few foreign companies in Sri Lanka. Some graduates get this benefit and try joining one of these companies and gain top salaries and development, which is better for them on the one hand. By saying that, there are also drawbacks for employees when selecting this kind of workplace. One of the main reasons is that graduates will not get a chance to serve their motherland directly. I have met underpaid people a lot in my ten-year IT career.A few years ago, when I was working for a company, I met people who had completed their degrees and did nonwhite collar jobs. I felt distraught when I talked with them and sympathised and asked, “Why do you want to work here like this?” The reply I got from them was that they do not have enough contacts and English knowledge.These  things should not happen in a developing country such as Sri Lanka. There should be a mechanism to make up the mindset of students  who pass out of the university. About their value for themselves and the motherland.If we could use all the technical assets how much money can we pump into our homeland? When we look at countries such as Singapore, which lagged behind Sri Lanka  economically at one time, now uses technological assets to reach the pinnacle of success, making more tourists visit their countries.One of the main reasons for the lack of knowledge assets in Sri Lanka is migration. People who pass out of the university and have completed three years experience migrate from Sri Lanka.I think the main reason for this is poor social security and the poor quality of life in Sri Lanka. It is hard for us to find a one-stop solution for these all problems. Nevertheless, at least there are a few things we can do as adults living in Sri Lanka, when raising and educating our children.One of the major obstacles we have here is that we do not get government support to set up a mechanism other than just going for a traditional internship which is at a low level. Most universities and colleges in Europe and North American countries indirectly practice this mechanism, and graduates can benefit from this opportunity. Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, graduates never get a chance to go through this mechanism.When will we find a one-stop solution for all of these issues? That’s a rhetorical question. Thinking makes the difference in everything.If we can inculcate in our children’s thinking, a positive attitude towards serving our motherland, and possibly if we can change the mindset of graduates who are pass out of the universities with a can-do attitude and make them understand their value, it is easier for us to start finding a solution for this burning issue. A degree holder generally can be considered as an uncut gem that needs to be cut and polished to have functioned at its best. It is our responsibility as adults to make those gems cut and polished.If we can maintain this positive attitude throughout the Sri Lankan IT industry, it will grow and pump more profits to our motherland.The writer is a Systems Engineer."
20 December 2020,More listings with return of foreign investors next year - Cabraal,"Foreign investors will return to the capital market when growth momentum builds up in the second half of next year encouraging more new listings in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), State Minister for Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms, Ajith Nivard Cabraal said on Friday. “I am keen to see new listings in the stock exchange as the growth momentum picks up mid next year which will be a shot-in-the-arm for capital market growth,” Cabraal said. The capital market bounced back recording higher turnovers in the past two months since the global pandemic stifled investor appetite in March. Local and foreign investors showed signs of renewed optimism despite the crippling impact of the killer virus across all sectors of the economy.The All Share Price Index (ASPI) and the S&P SL20 Index recorded higher gains with turnover crossing Rs. 2.7 billion last month.“With the return of foreign investors there will be new issuances by entities. The ASPI will have a progressive improvement and new laws of the SEC and the Port City project will help companies to do better,” Cabraal said, adding that new ventures and sectors will come into the market when growth picks up.He said the SEC and CSE must work on expediting the operation of the foreign currency board and attract more SMEs, startups and BOI entities which will help the growth of the capital market.The State Minister has held discussions with all stakeholders of the capital market since taking over office in August to assess the situation and take steps to develop the market.The Government aims at notching five percent and beyond economic growth from 2021 onwards having set the stage for it through the Budget which is aimed at boosting FDIs.According to Cabraal, the Government targets USD 2.5 billion FDIs next year. The FDI target this year is around USD 1.5 billion which is unlikely to be achieved."
1 December 2019,The Finance Company: No proposals received - CB,"The Central Bank has not received any proposals to invest in The Finance Company from anybody, a media release from the Bank stated.The text of the release: “The attention of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has been drawn to certain information published in newspapers and news websites on November 26 regarding the regulatory action taken by the CBSL on The Finance Company PLC (TFC) and it wishes to clarify the following.“The CBSL issued a notice of cancellation of the licence granted to TFC to carry on finance business under the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011 (FBA) on October 23, 2019.“The CBSL also informed that in terms of the provisions of the FBA, the company has the right to submit an acceptable proposal for investment in TFC along with proof of funds for capital infusion and a Business Restructuring Plan for the consideration of the CBSL within 30 days from the date of issuance of such notice.“Even though the news articles stated that TFC informed the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) that it has been approached by three interested parties to consider investing in the company, no such proposals have been submitted to the CBSL. Therefore, CBSL wishes to clarify that the information published in the articles in newspapers and news websites regarding any potential investments is not true and correct. “The CBSL wishes to inform that in terms of the FBA, the Monetary Board shall take a decision on the notice of cancellation issued to TFC after the expiration of 60 days from the date of notice of cancellation.”"

20 December 2020,External sector resilient in October,"In October 2020, the external sector exhibited its resilience with the successful repayment of the matured International Sovereign Bond (ISB) of US dollars 1.0 billion.During the month, external sector performance was supported by the continued improvement in the trade deficit, increase in workers’ remittances and the resultant stability in the domestic foreign exchange market.While imports continued to be restrained under low global oil prices and import restrictions imposed by the Government, exports dropped in October 2020 due to the disruptions to local production and support services following the resurgence of Covid-19 cases since early October and weak demand from foreign buyers.Workers’ remittances continued to record a year-on-year growth during the month.In the financial account, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recorded a marginal net foreign investment inflow, while the government securities market recorded a marginal net outflow in October 2020. Despite the repayment of the ISB, Sri Lanka maintained gross official reserves at US dollars 5.9 billion at end October 2020.Meanwhile, net inflows to the domestic foreign exchange market eased the pressure on the exchange rate, enabling the Central Bank to absorb foreign exchange during the month.Reflecting developments in the external sector, the Sri Lankan Rupee appreciated marginally during October 2020."
2 August 2020,"Whoever commands ports, attracts connectivity - Shippers Academy CEO","Fifty-five percent of containerised cargo is carried through the Indo-Pacific and 70 percent of the energy moves through this region which is a game changer for ports in the region and ship operators,  CEO, Shippers Academy, Colombo,  Rohan Masakorala said. He was speaking at the IORA (Indian Ocean Rim Association) conference in New Delhi on ‘Practical aspects of connectivity and ports and infrastructure’. If countries do not invest in infrastructure, trade suffers. Infrastructure is a key element for connectivity and to create economic value for economic blocks and individual countries, he said. Excerpts of the speech: “A shipping magnet once said, “Whoever who commands the sea commands the Straits”. In today’s context “whoever commands ports attracts connectivity”, which is also true in the Indian Ocean. If you look at ports in Singapore, the UAE, Malaysia and Sri Lanka, these connect nearly 65 percent of the Indian Ocean trades transshipment business, of these four ports, Sri Lanka holds 18-20 percent of Indian cargo while Dubai and Singapore hold the rest from the East and West Coast of India. This is the reality.   “Fifty-five percent of containerised cargo is carried through the Indo-Pacific and 70 percent of the energy moves through this region which is a game changer for the region in terms of ports and for ship operators. “As far as maritime connectivity is concerned, most of the time we leave out the real business operators who make connectivity happen for many reasons. For instance, location and availability of cargo is one of the considerations, availability of maritime services, freedom of business are also key points, along with availability of competitive energy prices. Singapore is the world’s number one bunker supplier to ships, and the UAE is the second largest bunker operator and bunker supplier to the world shipping industry. “Singapore receives large volumes of crude oil supplies from the Middle East, it refines these supplies, and feeds it back into global markets. As many as 10,000 ships are in Singapore waters around any given time. Connectivity is also shaped by ship operators followed by waiting time and port efficiency. If ports are not efficient you do not get ships coming there.      “A World Bank study showed that the operator efficiency in the Indian subcontinent’s ports excluding Colombo is about 50 percent which is why ships do not make dedicated port calls to many ports. Also, in today’s context, ships are getting bigger and call at ports that possess the requisite infrastructure. “World markets are changing, speed is becoming an important factor in connectivity, ship owners prefer to go to ports where there is infrastructure to receive big ships and with good feeder network and handle them fast. It is on this basis that they classify ports; ports that have over 90 per cent transshipment are pure transshipment ports such as Singapore. If it is above 50 per cent it is called a transshipment hub like Colombo where 70 per cent of the transshipment takes place and the average of 25 per cent transshipment is called regional gateway and others are called gateway ports. Shipowners“As far as who decides which port to call at, it is not policy makers or countries, instead shipowners who control 85 per cent of the container business worldwide will decide that factor(Mainly European, US and Asian carriers). They decide which port would be the hub or a feeder and this is the reality of the connectivity in the containerised business. It would be different for energy shipments based on refinery capacities and tankers, and bulk cargo depends on the demand and supply of the particular products for market.  “The biggest container ships can carry over 23,000 TEU containers and DNVG has now signed to build a 25,000 TEU vessel. These vessels have been in evolution over the last 25 years from about 1,500 to 3,000 TEUs to 25,000 TEUs and there are plans to build containerships capable of carrying 30,000 to 40,000 TEUs. These would not call at all the ports, but would sail from the east-west corridor including the Indo-Pacific.   “If countries do not invest in infrastructure, trade suffers. For instance, if the United States does not invest in infrastructure there will be losses in trade, revenue and jobs. Infrastructure is a key element for connectivity and to create economic value for economic blocks and individual countries.  “India has taken a number of initiatives; it started the Sagarmala project, there is coastal shipping liberalization but more efficiency is needed in ports of the Indian subcontinent. As far as the IORA region is concerned, only two ports are in the first ten category of top ports in the world and another two including Colombo In the first 30. In the Pacific Ocean there are a number of big ports including the Chinese ports. “In another five years, the global container market is expected to be nearly a billion TEUs and most of these would originate in the Indo-Pacific region. Ships capable of carrying 25,000 TEUs may not call at many ports.  In Sri Lanka, the Hambantota Port is a deep draft port and is a challenge to Colombo Port. We cannot have two ports in the same country competing; but that is going to happen, because Hambantota has a distinct advantage. It is 12 nautical miles or less from the main east-west shipping lane which means ships do not have to turn in to pick up transshipment cargo and come to Colombo for six hours diversion or go to Trincomalee Harbour. The Hambantota Port will be one of the key focus development ports in the world on the east-west shipping route. China has invested in Hambantota Port and the number of berths are planned for expansion from the present 5-6 to 33 deep berths. They are planning refineries there to connect energy as well as regional transshipment cargo to capture new business emerging out of the region. Today, nearly all the top vehicle carriers call at Hambantota Port. In the long run, the Hambantota Port will have a distinct advantage over Colombo Port id Colombo doesn’t compete with international partnerships. Sri Lanka is in the middle of the Indian Ocean and connectivity matters. Along with Singapore and UAE, these three hubs will dominate the Indian Ocean connectivity with Pacific Ocean maritime trade routes.  The Port of Colombo is becoming a bigger port for bigger container ships and two years ago it was the second fastest growing port in the world. It has slowed down slightly due to Indian trade volumes on account of the economic slowdown in India.  Whoever commands the sea, commands the trade which is a fact and Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohammed said a long time ago, that no matter how information technology advances, world trade cannot materialise without ports. This is extremely important for the littoral states of the Indian Ocean to understand that whoever commands the ports today, will connect the maritime industry. Ship owners will call at those ports, and no government or policy makers are going to make an impact on that because it is economics. "

5 June 2021,CSE: ASPI records 9.3% YTD growth,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has recorded 9.3% growth in Year-to-Date (YTD) All Share Price Index (ASPI) within the first five months of this year. The S & P SL 20 Index fared even better with YTD growth of 13% The market also saw record breaking YTD Market Turnover volume of Rs. 414.5 bn for the first five months of 2021.The YTD market turnover for 2021 exceeds the annual market turnover of Rs. 396 nn achieved last year.

The average number of trades per day is approximately 27,000 which is doubled compared to 2020.Another significant development in 2021 is the activation of the primary market for debt and equity.With the Government incentivising the use of the capital market, already three Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) were successfully concluded with all three issues being oversubscribed and closing on the opening day and raising an aggregate of Rs. 3.9 bn in equity capital. Two of the IPOs already commenced trading and these traded above the issued price. More equity IPOs are in the pipeline for 2021. The CSE also saw the very first listing of a SME company on the Empower Board and the state owned Ceylon Electricity Board issuing a Listed Public debenture.The market digitisation efforts also saw a significant number of new accounts being opened. Since the electronic account openings were enabled in September 2020, the daily volume of new accounts have doubled and many new younger investors are entering the stock market.Despite the significant increases in the market turnover, number of trades and the number of new accounts, the stock market is now operating remotely in view of the ongoing pandemic and the resultant travel restrictions.The CSE and all the market intermediaries have very quickly and successfully evolved to convert their operations to a digital format to operate from remote locations under a Work From Home (WFH) concept in keeping with the Government health and safety regulations."

19 September 2021,Apparel sector prioritises worker safety,"Leaders of the apparel sector highlighted the industry’s prioritisation of employee safety through the adoption of and adherence to comprehensive health measures, while ensuring business continuity and thereby the industry’s sustenance.These views were expressed at a  virtual webinar organised by the American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM) in Sri Lanka on the theme ‘The pandemic resilient corporate success of Sri Lanka’s apparel industry’ recently.The event featured Hirdaramani Group Director Aroon Hirdaramani, MAS Holdings Executive Director Shirendra Lawrence, Brandix Group subsidiary Moose Clothing Company’s Executive Director Hasib Omar and Star Garments Group Senior Manager, Business Analysis, Jeevith Senaratne. It was moderated by AMCHAM Sri Lanka President Presantha Jayamaha. The four leaders representing some of the industry›s biggest players assured that while over 90% employees have been partially vaccinated, and 70% have been fully vaccinated, companies are going above and beyond in adhering to the health and safety guidelines, seeking to provide the maximum possible protection to employees.“We’ve had to physically alter the production floors, establish social distancing protocols, implement health checks and remote working arrangements wherever possible. The discipline of adhering to these protocols was also established, and monitoring systems have been put in place,” Shirendra Lawrence said. Hasib Omar said, “Even though 70% of the workforce is fully vaccinated, the industry continues to maintain strict protocols such as social distancing, screening, random PCR testing and other Covid-19 prevention health and safety guidelines that are issued by the Ministry of Health.”The apparel industry leaders acknowledged the government and health authorities for their contribution in vaccinating the employees and the Joint Apparel Associations Forum (JAAF) in advocating for vaccination of all employees.While prioritising employee safety, the industry has to also focus on economic sustainability, to avoid dismantling the relationships that have been built over decades. These are critical to the future of the sector, which accounts for almost half the country’s export earnings. It employs 350,000 individuals directly, and has created 700,000 indirect jobs, and contributes 6% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), they said.  Lawrence said, “Industry leaders had to focus on balancing the economic sustainability of our organisations while giving top priority to the safety and protection of our employees, whose job roles require them to function from the factories..“We have to compete against global and regional competitors, if we are to retain the relationships that we’ve worked very hard to establish over the last 20 to 30 years. Some of these competitors may not be experiencing the same challenges we have at the present time, so it is not a level playing field,” he said.Despite significant order cancellations due to the pandemic, industry leaders said that the impact would have been more severe, if it hadn’t been for the strategic relationships that the industry established with buyers, and the reputation it had earned as an ethical, sustainable, innovative and high-value supplier.“Sri Lanka’s apparel industry has been built mostly on strategic customer relationships and partnerships, rather than on transactional order placements” said Aroon Hirdaramani.“These partnerships were very much tested by the pandemic and the resulting mass order cancellations. However, given the industry’s strategic partnerships, most buyers acted in that spirit of partnership; the discussions on solutions to issues were consultative and there were compromises on both sides,” he said.Industry leaders also pointed out that proactive actions and technology adoption by the sector ensured business continuity.Jeevith Senaratne said, “The pandemic accelerated the adoption of technology which existed but which was under-utilised. The prime example of this is 3D product development technology, using which we were able to produce samples virtually, get comments in real-time and execute, without having to produce physical samples, which was difficult given the circumstances. In our company, we have increased the share of 3D product development usage from 15% pre-pandemic to 50%,in our business.”Hasib Omar of Brandix shared his company’s experience of commencing the production of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) by initially configuring its machinery and obtaining approval for face mask exports amidst the constraints posed by the pandemic. That, he said, indicated the Sri Lankan apparel sector’s adaptability and resilience. JAAF represents five associations that cover supply chain partners, the export-oriented apparel manufacturers, buying offices and representatives of international brands in Sri Lanka."

5 June 2021,Benefits of value addition ,"The value addition is simply described as the monetary or non-monetary augmentation an organisation can give its products or services before selling them to the customers. Adding value is an important strategy of a commercial entity as this process provides incentives to customers to purchase their products that in turn increases the bottom line of the business. Carefully thought-out value addition can provide immense benefits to the customer whilst increasing market visibility for the business. Value-added selling is described in Wikipedia as one of the several sales techniques that rely on the inherent value of a product or service. Thus, the value adding technique is a more flexible and customised approach where sales and marketing teams of an organisation can easily outline the company’s value proposition to customers in their presentations.The term ‘Value Added’ is described as the difference between the price of a product and the cost incurred to produce it. The price is determined on the market criteria based predominantly on the competitor’s price. The product’s positioning against similar products in the market has to be considered to decide the price of such a product.    For example, an extra feature can be added to the product to increase value and the additional value-added can be used to influence customers to purchase the product. For example, an extra one-year service warranty offered free of charge to a customer who purchases a new computer, television or any other electronic product can be an immensely powerful motivator. In a fiercely competitive market where companies relentlessly struggle to attain the competitive edge, extra added value can be tremendously beneficial.  Various methodsValue-added selling implies the initiative taken to proactively search for methods to increase the value of a product, service, brand, or business.Companies apply various methods to increase the value additions such as enhancing the service delivery, improve customer convenience, and include additional items, volumes, or quantities.  As the first step in deciding the method of value-added selling, it is imperative to understand what the customer values with the product offered to sell. The transactional customer, who concentrates only on instantaneous purchasing, wants the right product at the lowest price. The customers who are having a relationship, whether long or short, need the understanding of the seller while informational customers need as much information possible from the seller before making the buying decision.  Research reveals that ninety-six percent of customers consider integrity as the most important criteria they expect from the seller. When they purchase goods, they need the trustworthiness of the company, particularly the salesperson who is attending to them. Customers also value the understanding of the staff from beginning to end of a transaction regardless of the time it takes to complete an order.This mindset applies whether the product is a small consumer item or a large property sale. The knowledge of the staff with their commitment to the task is always appreciated by the customers tremendously.All these norms are traditional non-financial added values customers admire and appreciate from an organisation.  Successful companies with strong brand equity increase the value of their products by using their logos. For example, entities such as Coca-Cola, Nike, Mercedes-Benz, and Toyota are increasing the value of their brands by sponsoring major social events or by funding sports activities and professional sports teams. e-retail giant Amazon adds value to its business by offering automatic refunds for unsatisfactory service, offers free shipping, and price-guarantee on pre-ordered items. Apart from incentivising by way of tangible additions, companies add value to their products by offering useful services to customers.This also is almost equally effective. Support services with enhanced quality are one of the methods organisations use very often as value addition. Twenty-four-hour customer service hotlines, extended warranties, and free deliveries are some of them. FreeMarketers also offer consulting services free to customers for some products or services. For example, when a customer purchases a refrigerator, a member from the technical staff is sent to the customer’s residence to educate him or her about the usage and other technicalities a user must know, relieving the customer from going through complicated details of a handbook or user manual. Most of the major Sri Lankan electrical and electronics goods retailers practice this method successfully.  Offering personal services after purchasing, ideally through the sales team member engaged in the sale, can enhance the value of a product as well as the business. These types of acts not only increase the trust of the customer but also create a long-lasting relationship between the two factions. Simply inviting the customer to call if a problem arises with the product can go the extra mile.  In certain types of businesses, the customer can be assisted through promotional services. Usually, this method is effective in Business-to-Business (B to B) selling situations.Offering the customer business advice, providing contacts, point of sale material, free samples, additional tools, and technical guidance are some of the value additions companies can put in place.To facilitate value-addition in day-to-day selling activities, businesses need creativity and innovation to counter competition. Without getting into a price war with competitors, companies can devise methods to attract customers by resourceful value addition. Products can be offered as a bundle with an additional item attached such as a gift. Alternatively, companies offer products at a  discounted price when the customers purchase two or more similar items.Also, frequent buyer incentive programs are given to patrons for purchasing goods from a company regularly. Most of the airlines use this incentive for frequent flyers. The intention is to keep the customer from moving to a competitor.   Providing opportunities for recurrent buyers by recognising them periodically is another successful value-added concept applied by companies.The company motivates the buyers to identify themselves as outstanding customers. As is human nature, customers like being recognised. Dedicated staff memberCompanies’ that market technical products or professional services often appoint a dedicated staff member to provide services from the beginning to the end of a transaction with their clients. This is a very strong value-addition method for customers who purchase technical products or services where they need frequent support from the seller. By appointing a single committed employee to serve, they not only become satisfied but also build up an unconditional trust with the product purchased or the service obtained.    Speed of delivery of a product also is a solid value addition to certain product categories. For example, Pizza delivery companies offer free products on late deliveries.Timely delivery is a strong component related to any product as value addition.    Consumers today are more knowledgeable than ever before. They spend time comparing product offers by reading reviews and seeking referrals from others. With the information easily accessible through mobile phones and the relentless feed of information in social media, customers are aware of the best available in the market.They invariably hunt for value-added products and services. Customers also have become more demanding now and question even the slightest issue from the seller.  Creating a meaningful and effective value-added service can take time. However, value addition is not merely offering ‘extras’ to make customers happy, although the customers are always on the lookout for free gifts in any market.However, smart marketers find ways and means to go deeper on the concept of added value to obtain profound mutual benefits to the seller and the consumer.  "

23 August 2020,Customer engagement in retail business,"Customer engagement is an essential element in sales that emotionally connects customers and the buying process, common to any type of selling situation. It is about encouraging customers to work together and share the experiences created as a business.If executed well, the strategy will bring growth and success to a business. If the staff, from top to bottom, understand this well, a retail store can prosper as this strategy is probably one of the best tools for customer satisfaction.   Customer engagement is a process that focuses on value creation rather than actual revenue generation. Organisations that practise customer engagement always try to offer something more meaningful beyond the sales pitch. They offer maximum customer experience, valuable content, and interactive on the spot customer support. If, as an owner, you concentrate on customer engagement more, your staff members will transform from a mere order getter to a friend, associate, or advisor to your customer.  The customer is ready to pay more if the experience in the store is friendlier than that of your competitors.If the salespeople on the floor effectively interact, customers will involuntarily be encouraged enough to buy the products available in the store. If the sales team members cannot get the customer emotionally involved, the product knowledge or usual selling skills will not be sufficient to persuade the prospect to make a tangible purchase. Chances that the prospect will walk out without buying can be high in such a situation.     There are a few elements of effective engagement. Physical touching, trying on, or holding an item to demonstrate can be considered as a tentative purchase.  Encouraging the customer to ask more questions and answering them in a cordial and friendly manner will make the interrelation easier than usual. The questions centered on the customer’s own experience in use of the product concerned and how it would help them personally will provide amazing results. Also, more questions from the customer will create better value in terms of relationships.With the availability of the internet, customers are more informed and knowledgeable. Hence, unlike before, the customer who walks into the store should be managed more cautiously. As a result of social media and other communication channels, the art of being friendly must be practiced genuinely and with care today. When this writer was a retail store salesman in the early 80s, the situation was much easier and uncomplicated with less competition, less training, absence of television and social media, and those facts made the job much more convenient. Connect emotionallyIf the sales staff on the floor is not fully engaged in taking time to connect emotionally with the customer, they will possibly drive them away never to return. Repeating customer visits is an important factor in retail sales. This is why many large brands make an extra effort to practise customer engagement and improve brand loyalty. However, smaller retail store owners do not consider this as an important tool, mainly due to unawareness of its potential. Most of them are happy with the mediocre friendly attitude of the staff toward customers.   By providing an awesome experience in the store through the sales staff, you probably may prevent them from walking into your competitors. It will also ensure their repeat visits, most probably even when you are not competitive. When your customer knows someone from your store on a personal level, their relationship with your store will move from merely a transaction to a more meaningful bond. How important is customer engagement in a retail store? Customers visit retail stores for the human experience. Customers who develop a human feeling about the store will buy more. The chance of repetition will also be more. Therefore, the retailer needs to train staff to provide such an experience. A retail store staff member must always try to offer customers something they cannot get from other places.    Creating a general customer profile and conveying it to the staff is a good first step when you decide to focus on the customer engagement process. Understanding the common characteristics and the behaviour of patronising customers is helpful. An analysis of lost sales that is done periodically, though complicated, can produce positive results. It is also helpful to prepare a list of the common questions they ask before purchasing or rejecting is useful to prepare your staff for more effective interaction. Repeat customerMaking an extra effort to know your customers before reaching out to them is essential. Hence, you have to treat the customer feedback as a gift. To encourage the retail customers to offer their opinion to determine the reason to drive value to them, a simple survey with short questions, probably coupled with a promotion, could be conducted.  This information will be immensely valuable when you train frontline staff.  Research, experience, and expert opinion reveal that the vast majority of repeat customer visits to retail stores take place mainly because of the friendly and helpful floor staff.  It is a known fact that almost every buyer likes to be treated well. This is a key factor that differentiates the success and failure of a retail business. Retail businesses mainly fail due to an unfriendly approach by untrained and unskilled staff. Therefore, paying attention to staff behaviour is a salient factor in retail trade.    Improving customer engagement rate is a customer-centric model in this digital era as customers are well informed and understand competition more than in the pre-internet period. Most customers know what they need before they set foot in a showroom. The sales team must be trained to emotionally connect with the customer without focusing on selling mechanically.Your customer-facing team should be equipped with emotional intelligence and positive attitude training to deliver the best possible customer experience. Managing the interpersonal relationship with the customer empathically must be the goal of the training.Entrepreneurs who run retail businesses must adopt customer retention strategies such as customer engagement. The most vital factor is to understand that selling in any situation is centered on people. Therefore, the owners must notice them genuinely and share experiences with them to build positive customer satisfaction. Customer loyalty is one of the most important factors in business that pays off big. "

11 October 2020,Develop and grow new revenue streams,"Organisations of all sizes and across all sectors need to plan for further disruptions. Blind spots can hurt you anytime. It’s a difficult task for those on your team who have been working round the clock to adapt to changes during the pandemic.Develop a contingency plan for going into company shutdown mode. What does your weekly or monthly budget look like if you suspend operations? How much cash would you need to cover your weekly expenses in this scenario?If your business was lucky enough to develop an alternative revenue stream during the pandemic, consider investing in the growth of that new direction. For others who have not yet found an alternative source of income, it’s time to think creatively.What do your customers need right now, and how could you fill that need? How does this dovetail with your existing products and services?Your brand already has an audience; you just need to pivot to meet them where they are right now. Covid-19 exposed supply chain and logistics vulnerabilities for companies worldwide, especially those that rely on single source providers or suppliers concentrated in specific geographic areas. Evaluate supply chain risk based on the likelihood of further disruption.Spike in absenteeism likelyIn the current environment, absenteeism is inevitable that may affect especially manufacturing operations. So identify essential functions and cross-train employees to ensure necessary staffing if absenteeism spikes.Covid-19 exposed operating risks for companies, including overreliance on some personnel to perform critical functions. This presents an operational threat and puts added pressure on individuals tasked with performing these functions. Remote work became a hallmark of the pandemic for businesses.For those that could remain operational at a distance, this has been a major benefit. If your business shifted to a remote-first approach to work during the pandemic, consider making those policies permanent. If your shift to remote work was fraught with challenge, assess what went wrong and try to improve upon those mistakes. The time is now to evaluate what worked and what you need to improve in terms of online business and remote work.Put those plans and systems in place now. That is an investment that may very well make the difference between maintaining continuity of operations or shutting down completely.Develop a formal process for implementing Delegations of Authority and other financial and legal processes so they can be executed remotely.Ideally, you should have layers two-deep, so you always have at least one available backup. Build a systematic method for suspending, closing and resuming operations.The process you implemented during the first wave should serve as a guide. Document all the steps so you can implement them consistently and quickly for any business disruption. Set up or if you already have, update your succession plan should something happen to you or one of your critical employees so the business can continue. All businesses, regardless of size, should have a disaster and business continuity plan in place, along with a crisis team that is ready to put that plan into action.Communicate with customersIt remains as pivotal as ever that you keep everyone – your employees and customers alike – fully apprised of your plans and expectations during the Covid-19 pandemic. Not only is it important for your business to keep everyone informed, but your customers and employees are looking to your brand for support at an uncertain and difficult time. Offer that support in a direct and easily understood way. The most important aspect of making all of this happen effectively is communication. Businesses must plan to communicate often with their employees and their customers on a regular basis.Whatever your unique situation, it is critical to develop a contingency plan. Even if second-wave business closures don’t materialise, you will be well positioned for any other unforeseen crises, such as natural disasters or social upheaval. If the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us one thing, it’s that all businesses must expect the unexpected; this preparation could be the difference between surviving and closing your business permanently.In 2020, we have learned the significance of a business disaster continuity plan. Don’t be caught without one, should things take a turn for the worse."
22 November 2020,Why it’s best to ignore the doomsayers,"A recent jeremiad about having to tighten our belts in part prompts this article about next year, and the more than sanguine prospects for 2021 when it dawns — contrary to the doomsayer predictions. At the time of writing it’s not known what the budget portends, but no matter.The prognosis for next year does not have to be the one seen through dark tinted glasses. Already, vaccine-nomics is making projections for 2021 go through the roof.Two vaccines for Covid-19, one by Pfizer and the other by Moderna have shown excellent results and the better news is that their rollout may not take as long as earlier imagined.But the only thing the doomsayers in the commentariat here are capable of saying is that our debt is so enormous that we have no chance. They say that we tighten our belts, or we perish.The overriding factor for 2021 and the recovery that’s bound to happen is the vaccine, and nothing else. There is turmoil in the US.The Republicans have essentially not accepted the election results, and that means millions of men and women haven’t either. But despite the tumult and the marches on the streets, the vaccine driven hopes have buoyed the stock market.Anyone who is blind to the signs, are so blind they refuse to see. As for the debt, it is not set in stone and a certain quantum of it has to be renegotiated. The Opposition here is rubbing their collective palms together in glee and telling everyone who cares to listen, that ‘sah’ has failed.CrowFirst, they tried what they thought was the pejorative, ‘Nandasena.’ The assumption was that referring to the President by what is after all his other name would diminish his stature, and his work.That tactic boomeranged so badly, because Nandasena is a good Sinhala name and one cannot possibly make a pejorative out of it. That tactic of trying to lampoon the President with his own name failed miserably and now they have settled on ‘sah.’They are trying to celebrate ‘sah’s’ ‘failure’, or so they tell us forgetting the fact that they similarly celebrated the ‘failure’ of the war in 2009, just months before the denouement at the Nandikadal after which the cynics ate a considerable quantity of crow. Of course the darkest hour then was before dawn. But the doomsayers then as now predicted that the darkness would be permanent.The same portends for the world economy as well. Those who predicted a permanent contraction of the global economy are probably in for a shock. The prediction was that the vaccine was not anywhere near a rollout stage as there would have to be protracted trials that would take ages.BrigadeStrangely, at the moment it is not the vaccine per se that’s causing the optimistic market reaction, but the news that the jab is somewhere on the shelf, even though it has not been marketed yet. As the U.S anti-virus czar Dr. Fauci said, help is on the way. It’s the perceptions that matter, and likewise, what would be disastrous for our economy is to retreat into a shell saying we are resigned to the fate of belt-tightening.That’s not the remedy we need because if people don’t spend their cash next year, growth will be retarded. It’s probably a good time to remember that a former US President when asked what he wanted the people to do when his country was coming out of a certain crisis, said, “I want them to go shopping.”Of course the doomsday brigade is out in full force. It was weeks ago that they were circulating a video shot at a well known hotel saying it has ‘gone to seed,’ when in fact the place had been converted to a quarantine facility which necessitated that certain public areas be shut down.It didn’t mean by any reckoning that the hotel had gone to seed. It’s ready to spring back to life, as soon as the guests — be they local or foreign — start trickling in when the economy starts improving — which seems to be sooner, rather than later.They are also circulating videos of ‘ghost shopping malls’, which is again a canard. The video is obviously staged because if you go to any of the shopping malls that are spotlighted, they can be seen functioning as best as possible under the circumstances — mostly open, but not having the steady stream of customers that they used to, for obvious reasons.It’s unnecessary getting into issues of U.S domestic politics, but it is to President Trump’s credit that he launched Operation Warp Speed, which even his biggest detractor CNN says, was responsible for the quick unveiling of not one but two vaccines.Trump did predict that the vaccine would be announced a week or so after the presidential election, which is exactly what happened. The best reaction to that from this remote neck of the woods would be, ‘no comment.’GrudgingApparently, the U.S President plans to rollout the vaccine free of charge for American citizens. The cost aspect with regard to countries such as ours is still unclear though.The ‘sah’ taunt here aimed at President Gotabaya by the way seems to be a missile that the Opposition aims at itself. It’s more than mildly evocative of the ‘oh yes massa’ type of plantation language from Jim Crow America.Those who aim the ‘sah’ nickname at the President may suffer from the slave mentality, hence ‘sah’ like massa— but the people essentially consider the President a comrade. But ‘sah’ is also a back-handed compliment. They tried many epithets of the type that worked on past Presidents. After all, we have the five years since 2015 to go by. But their fall back sobriquet for President Gotabaya was ‘sah.’ That’s a grudging sign of respect, even though ‘sah’ is supposed to be suffused with sarcasm.It bears mention also — not just by the way — that the ‘sah’s’ failure’ narrative that the Opposition has been lamely trying to peddle, had as its main pivot, attacks dealing with the Government’s foreign policy. But the desperation was apparent when after having tried to say we are a vassal State of China in the next breath they tried to say that we are a satrapy of the U.S!But Mike Pompeo came and went, and other than good vibes, there was nothing to report because there was no sellout pact or any such thing that came out of the Secretary of State’s visit.The doomsayers out in force say the Government cannot carry out all its plans, and if they are referring to the original plans it has to be obvious because we are in the midst of a global pandemic, tourism is non-existent, foreign markets have dried up in certain sectors, etc.But a change of strategy that may be called for is not a white flag of surrender. Folding up and belt-tightening — another term for interest rate hikes and other restrictive monetary policy — is the last thing we want to have at the moment.The President did the correct thing by reducing taxes as soon as he took office, and this too has been criticised by the doomsayers. Covid-19 of course was not anticipated at the time of the tax hikes anyway, so it’s preposterous to say that the taxation policy was a failure. But if 2021 is a year of growth, things will return to the status quo ante. That’s when we’d realise, the worst of our fears in 2020 were imagined."
16 August 2020,SLT Group posts Rs. 4.6b PAT ,"Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (SLT) Group released its financial results for the first-half of 2020 recording a 55% YoY growth in its Operating Profits to Rs. 6.9 bn, amidst the many challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.The Group revenue reached Rs. 44.1 bn during the first six months of 2020 demonstrating a moderate growth of 3.6% YoY, primarily due to the relief packages and free data offered to customers by SLT together with its mobile arm Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd, to assist the customers during the pandemic.The unexpected delays in investment projects owing to the pandemic too impacted adversely on the top line. Nevertheless, surge in the use in Broadband, IPTV and Career Business services in residential and business sectors due to the work from home arrangements and temporary closure of many educational and business entities, lifted the revenues of the Group.Stringent cost management measures reduced the Operating Costs before Depreciation and Amortisation by 7% YoY, raising EBITDA margin to 40.5% from 33.4% in the year before. EBITDA of the Group stood at Rs. 17.8 bn, up 25% YoY.The Interest Expenses and Finance Costs rose to Rs. 1.4 bn from Rs. 0.6 bn as a result of increased borrowings to finance the growing capital expenditure in order to align with the global technological trends and fulfilling the changing customer demands. FOREX losses of the Group mounted to Rs. 0.9 bn from Rs. 15 mn in the same period last year due to the depreciation of Sri Lankan Rupee against USD, arising from the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Other Income of the Group grew to Rs. 0.5 bn, up 85% YoY which improved the Group profits.Group Profit Before Tax (PBT) was Rs. 5.7 bn, while Profit After Tax (PAT) was Rs. 4.6 bn, demonstrating a YoY increase of 31%.Growth in revenue coupled with efficient cost management techniques pushed the PAT margin up to 10.4% from 8.2% for the corresponding period a year earlier.SLT Group Chairman Rohan Fernando said, “I believe that leading with empathy and a sense of connection with employees, business and community partners, and customers is the root cause of our success.”Group CEO Lalith Seneviratne said, “We have made several initiatives with an eye towards reaping synergies within the holding company and subsidiaries in the long term.”CEO, SLT, Kiththi Perera said, “SLT as a responsible corporate citizen is engaging in a variety of CSR activities including the donation of one million face masks.” COO Priyantha Fernandez said, “We are continuing our journey to increase fibre footprints across the country to provide an ultra-speed experience to customers.” "
20 December 2020,Work from home model to continue in the future,"Covid-19 is forcing economies and businesses to swiftly transform their business activities to the digital medium to meet the continuing challenge. As per the available information on the global business scenario, the majority of companies have already adapted to remote work policies.Many of them are considering whether to have the ‘Work From Home’ (WFH) model as a temporary measure or to keep it permanently. The unprecedented situation caused due to the pandemic has led companies to switch office activities to remote work operations.While many of the large organisations in Sri Lanka have already introduced the model to their respective organisations, small and medium organisations are also gradually realising the need and adjusting themselves to the concept.With rapidly evolving technology and online tools such as video conferencing and other effective applications that are widely used, Sri Lankan business entities also hastily transforming to remote office functions.The concept initially seemed alien to many Sri Lankan entities that were used to work in conventional office routines throughout modern business history. However, the local companies, particularly small and medium-sized organisations are hurriedly adjusting to the WFH concept to reap various benefits that had been already identified.The opinion of several business leaders I have had dialogues on the subject is of the view that the remote workplace model is tremendously effective in many factors. Almost everybody was highly optimistic about the new arrangement and confidently declared that they are experiencing the model as a fail-safe activity. Many of these companies were practicing WFH models since March this year.If the organisation has the technical resources in place to work from home and if the physical presence of workers are not essential, the model can be successful in any company whether it’s small, medium, large, or conglomerate.The employees must be equipped with suitable hardware and software and the company must have digital adoption solutions to support them. Remote work can open up more options by way of employment of various talents easily as the geographical location of the employee is irrelevant and they can be recruited from anywhere in the country, or even from overseas.No legal bindingWork from home is an arrangement and agreement between the employer and the employee without any legal binding. However, when the employee agrees to work from home, there are responsibilities for him to produce similar or better productivity compared to the previous practice.Although the work environment is more convenient, the employee must be self-disciplined to offer the necessary output.Homeworking offers more flexibility in working arrangements. The employee is not tied to an office thus is better placed to offer extra hours if required.Besides, a homeworking environment can help employee retention as it extends convenience to certain personal issues of the employee. Employers declare that they have already witnessed enhanced productivity from workers.Working from home concept has already proved that the efficiency and general output of the staff are more due to fewer interruptions. The home environment, when properly organised, allows for a quieter work environment.For example, in the office, workers experience constant distractions such as colleagues’ chatter, telephones ringing, public traffic, verbal instructions, and so forth that can cause anxiety.BenefitsDuring the pandemic, commuting to the office can be unsafe. Working from home eliminates the danger of interacting with others during travel. Also, the burden of the stress of travelling is removed completely and hours of travel time can be used for productive work.The time saved offers extra health benefits such as additional sleep or resting time and the staff members can enjoy more time with the families. These factors present a better balance in work and home life and a stress-free mindset to employees.Working from home provides loads of financial benefits to employers and employees. Employers will have savings on expenditure such as office space, rent, electricity, utility expenditure, additional facilities, fuel expenses, traveling fees, and so forth.Savings in a month from these compulsory expenditures can run into substantial amounts depending on the nature of the business. On the other hand, the staff has benefits such as travelling costs, meals, and other sundry expenses that they spend daily.Even when the Covid-19 threat is wiped out completely, the staff will have lesser exposure to many other common diseases.As they are working in isolation, there is a much less chance of getting infected. This will reduce sickness absenteeism.In most instances, even when they are sick, by being at home, they can offer some kind of service to the organisation. The employees will also feel a less need for regular holidays as the work from home environment offers a natural ‘break’.An important factor to keep in mind is that a large portion of the workforce such as craftsmen, health care workers, hotel industry personnel, manufacturing concerns, and many more segments are engaged in physical labour.There is no way to involve these segments in digital work environments. Therefore, when the policies are created, the companies must consider these factors as they can only involve part of the staff in these physical labour oriented establishments.A clear disadvantage of WFH is that every worker may not be suitable to adapt to the model because of the differences in personality, ability, and possible personal issues.Some of the employees prefer routine and structured work environments and fancy interacting with colleagues rather than being alone at home.Such employees will provide negative productivity unless they are psychologically motivated. In my personal opinion, based on my own experience, this mindset can be easily changed by proper guidance. The usual phenomenon is that people resent change but they become accustomed to the situation sooner or later.Negative factorAnother possible negative factor is that the WFH staff may feel isolated and disconnected from their colleagues.An effective communication plan can reduce this aspect with the assistance of suitable video conferencing applications.Regular team meetings, brainstorming sessions, and even personal chats and catch-ups can help overcome the issue where the staff can feel that they are part of the team.Home distractions and potential burnouts on personal mental health must be avoided.An office provides a clear distinction between office-life and home-life.When both these important aspects come together at the same location, the employee must be educated to distinguish the two different important parts of life. If not properly managed, an increase of stress and the potential burn-out will be inevitable.As lucrative as the idea of remote working sounds, there are several negative factors as well. The advantages are apparent with many beneficial features.However, the impression that home-based employees tend to work less can prevail in the mindset of conventional businessmen.This is where a well-balanced monitoring plan is essentially required from day one. The employers must be thorough with supervising and the employees must be exceedingly self-disciplined to avoid possible frictions.Finally, from the employer’s angle, the most excellent benefit of the work from home model is the operational cost reduction that runs into substantial savings whilst the two most negative aspects are the information security risk and difficulty in performance monitoring.There are many ways to counter the problem of monitoring through technology with the assistance of many modern software applications and video options. Daily progress can be easily supervised against a predetermined goal through physical remote monitoring or software.Information security risks can pose a threat to a company’s plans and other important data. The WFH staff is exposed to company servers remotely and much confidential information also will be out in the open. Employers must ensure that they introduce encryption software to protect such data. There are many measures in this regard available with proper systems and technology."
28 March 2021,EFC hosts webinar on equal opportunities for women,"The Training and Certifications Unit of the Employers’ Federation of Ceylon (EFC) recently organised a webinar under the banner, ‘Women in Leadership: Working towards equal opportunities amid Covid-19 challenges.’ The webinar which was aligned with the International Women’s Day, enabled a platform to discuss the efforts taken locally and internationally to shape a ‘more equal future’ for women leaders in the private sector while facing Covid-19 challenges. The panel comprised Senior Program Officer, International Training Centre of the ILO in Turin, Jeanne Schmitt, Head of HR, Standard Chartered Bank, Ransi Dharmasiriwardhana, Independent Consultant, Multi Sectoral Global Business Development, Ramya Weerakoon, and Attorney-at-Law and former Assistant Director General and Head of Training, EFC, Ayomi Fernando.Jean Schmitt said gender diversity helps businesses to thrive. Citing the ILO’s report, ‘The business case for change  (2019)’, she said that inclusive policies and an inclusive business culture have a positive impact on productivity, ability to attract and retain talent, creativity, innovation and openness and the company’s reputation. The share of women in management is proportionate to a country’s income, the report revealed.“Only 22% of all CEO positions are occupied by women,” said the ILO expert. The share of women CEOs decreases proportionate to the size of the enterprise. “Only 16% of women CEOs occupy large sized companies while 20% of them are found in medium-sized companies and 26% in small enterprises.”While ‘glass walls’ and ‘glass ceilings’ hinder women from moving into higher levels of decision making and upper-level positions, their visibility, empowerment and leadership is even more crucial in the present digital age, remarked Schmitt. In moving forward and creating a public debate in championing a more gender-balanced workforce, employer organisations can play a crucial role, she said.Sharing the success story of Standard Chartered Bank in realising a ‘culture of equal opportunity and inclusion’, its HR Head, Ransi Dharmasiriwardhana said, “Diversity and inclusion is very much a part of our DNA and it is not just a HR initiative for us, but much more than that.”  She said her organisation is conscious of overcoming roadblocks such as biases and self-limiting beliefs and priorities.Ramya Weerakoon said, “In a culture of honour and inclusion, there is nothing which you cannot achieve.” Sharing her personal journey of surviving and thriving in gender-based industries with tools such as navigating unconscious bias, developing a language of competence and focusing and strategising on how to balance work and life. The shift in work-life balance with increased and unrestricted demands on time, domestic violence, fear and anxiety take an enormous toll on women. The senior professional who called for various proactive interventions to mitigate the burden. Ayomi Fernando said unconscious bias which results from negative messaging can prevent many women from reaching their true potential. This is reflected across the board, said the lawyer cum senior trainer who cited a recent global survey which revealed that in every country researched, men and women are less comfortable about women being CEOs. “Free education of invests in our girls and when we look at our university output, we see many young women ahead of their male counterparts, but sadly after a while a good number of them take the back seat which is a huge loss,” said Fernando. Calling for proper information to be made available for girls to select their future careers, she also stressed on the need to open them to wider career options. "
19 July 2020,  Importance of strategic alignment to beat Covid-19,"Covid 19 has made markets more fiercely competitive than ever before. Markets for almost all products and services have shrunk, costs have escalated, and finance costs have skyrocketed. Competition is growing in every single industry, every single day across the whole world. Yet our businesses have to go on for which we need to compete better with more acute and sharper strategy. If you wish your business to stay profitable, it’s time to stop seeing your competitors as villains trying to eat into your profit share with a sinister laugh.The best way to hurt them is by bettering their strategies to beat them. There is only one effective way of doing this. Instead of focusing on your competitors’ flaws, concentrate on their winning strategies, cost reduction measures, successful campaigns, and why they are better than you if that’s the case.If you are the leader and you still need to do better, what competitor strategies can you outperform by a high margin? To get past the mindset that your competitors are weaker, take a moment and do this exercise.List the five most successful things your three or four biggest competitors have done after covid-19 – in the new normal world. Don’t simply do this yourself, have your key managers do the same. This will help you take a step back and assess the situation without letting personal feelings get in the way. You can also access why they were smart ideas and how you can replicate or improve on them.Self examinationTry to put yourself in your competitors’ shoes. What do they think of you? How do they think you’ll act in a given situation? If you can decipher their expectations of you, you can anticipate their next move. You can also learn about your own flaws since it’s likely that your competitors have been underestimating you the same way you have been underestimating them. Self examination is often easier when you take the time to step away from the rut of your habitual thinking and view yourself from another perspective.If you are making moves because of actions your competitors are taking, you are inevitably sailing in their wake. The competitor becomes the leader. You are now making your business decisions based on their refreshed business plan and vision, and not your own.You should never change course in reaction to the actions of a competitor. Instead, you must make all of your decisions based on your own plan. Craft a business that works for you and for your customers bearing in mind the covid-19 implications to your business and your competitors – and keep an eye on other businesses and their reactions to see if there is anything that you are missing.It’s painful to lose business to a competitor and it has its own negative implications. The gut reaction is to think that you are doing something wrong. You will be tempted to change course, to play the game by your competitors’ rules. Well, don’t. You better have your own set of rules that you play by. If you deliver superior quality and service, you have no business trying to compete on price.Be the first moverYou can’t have every single customer. Even if you accomplished this, the government would step in and break up your monopoly. There are customers out there that you simply won’t get to have. So stop coveting your competitor’s customers, even if they used to be your customers.You need to find your ideal profitable customer segment, and then own that segment. Losing customers by the boatload? Then, sure, you need to reevaluate your business. But do it on your terms, not someone else’s.Keeping up with the competition is a losing play from the outset. You have a completely different company; different customer value proposition, different strategy, and many other differences. If you try to model your business after the success you think you see, without regard to your unique business, you will create a monster. While you start to have some success, you will eventually go down in flames. Instead, focus internally. Make sure you have a solid company that can bring in sales, service those sales, and grow at a sustainable pace.After all you only have a certain percentage of the market that you can effectively play in to make a return. Expanding your footprint is, therefore, possible though the overall market is down due to Covid-19. Find those profitable opportunities when your competitors are still wandering around. Be the first mover to gain an advantage."
22 November 2020,Budget 2021 focuses on reviving pandemic-hit economy,"Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa as Minister of Finance, presented the first Budget of the SLLP government in Parliament on Wednesday.The ‘people-friendly Budget’ included a series of key proposals that focused on reviving the pandemic hit economy through the development of local businesses, industries and foreign investment. He also outlined the measures envisaged for social welfare, education and environmental protection in addition to poverty alleviation as visualised in the “Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour”, the policy framework of the Government of President Gotabaya RajapaksaMinimising the disparities in income levels between provinces and the urban rural inequalities are core factors, the Premier underscored saying that, “We are at a time, when many countries have realised the geopolitical significance of our country.”He said, “We should formulate our national policies with a long term strategic vision, protecting our sovereignty, to exploit the development opportunities that arise as a central hub, in the new economic order of the world, to both the conventional western advanced economies and the powerful emerging eastern economies.”President Gotabaya Rajapaksa also arrived in Parliament on Thursday to watch the budget debate in progress.It was the second day of the debate on the second reading of Budget 2021.The President entered the Chamber with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. This was the first time he sat in the House after addressing the inaugural session of the new Parliament.The following are proposals introduced in Budget 2021:"
12 April 2020, Coronavirus’ effect on consumer behaviour ,"The consumer is a person or an organisation that purchases goods or services strictly for consumption in general terms. Consumer behaviour is the decision a person makes to purchase a product, service or idea after a search and selection. Consumer market is the system that influences and permits us to purchase goods, services or ideas. In the consumer market, the consumer makes decisions on how the money will be spent to purchase and use the product the way he or she wants.      Many factors affect the buying behaviour such as attitudes, beliefs and outside motivation, fundamentally influenced by cultural, social, and psychological views. Manipulated by these behavioural aspects, the consumer purchases a product or service usually going through a decision-making process consisting of need recognition, information search and evaluation of the gathered information.    A person or business that sells goods to a person or group for use of consumption needs to analyze the buying behavior of the buyer in order to succeed. Any retailer, irrespective of the size of the business is impulsively aware of this fact. In fact the knowledge levels differ depending on the level of education and other similar factors, but the actions of any retailer is mostly similar.Considering the high degree of the prevailing uncertainty about the ongoing speed of spread, rate of recovery and still increasing deaths, post crisis consumption or attitudes of the buyers cannot be predicted as yet. However, a few obvious changes can be noticed from what we have already seen in common thinking. Many of the middle and upper middle people I interviewed on the issue are of the view that they have to cut back on non-essential expenses such as local and overseas leisure travel, club membership, additional transport costs and even some outsourced domestic services.   The pandemic will alter consumer behaviour across the entire landscape of retail business throughout the world. Sri Lanka also will undoubtedly feel the pinch as the spread of coronavirus can lead to a substantial consumer behavior shift. Retailers will experience the impact of the crisis long after the quarantine period is over and social distancing rules ends. The crisis is likely to create a permanent behavioral change that retailers need to be prepared and planned immediately to sustain the existing business.  The aim of the Government is to make convenience goods available freely to households throughout the curfew affected country. Not only the effort is highly successful but the act also has paved the way to a new trend. During the past two weeks, Sri Lankan consumers seemed to be rapidly getting used to ordering consumer goods through home delivery requisitions. Although such practices were previously available on a random basis, the consumers were not fully accustomed to use this facility. This will somewhat hinder retailer foot traffic but the leniency towards home delivery services will increase significantly.There is a high probability that many of those first time grocery buyers will convert to online and other methods of home delivery facilities permanently although a clear prediction cannot be made due to the novelty of the practice. This means that the shift in the anticipated behaviour change will move a lot of volume from brick and mortar to ordering home delivery. According to some of the small and medium retailers, I spoke to, there are some practical issues in their respective geographical areas. Collection of cash on delivery is the main concern. Unlike large store chains, small and medium retailers do not possess online payment facilities, thus have to stick to cash payments. Although they may not entirely prefer the system, they will have to take the cue from large retailers and devise a more practical method to go with the tide.          The prevailing visible shortage of consumer essentials has been created as a consequence of stockpiling due to the popular belief that the item will be scarce. Although Government agencies declare that there is no shortage, consumers seem to be reluctant to accept it. The public presumes that the shut down of businesses and services will continue indefinitely.Therefore, most of them try to prepare a disaster pantry to the best of their financial capability. This is great news for smart retailers as they can provide customers a service to remember the provider at this crucial time because the Sri Lankans, by nature are keen to return favours, thus will return to the trader for repeat purchases.  Leaders of large retail chains or large individual stores are doing an excellent job in realistically and clearly communicating the message to their customers.  As far as I have noticed, they are adequately gearing to cater to the post-epidemic challenge. However, small and medium scale retailers have not yet understood the gravity of the full impact to come. Even for them, the attitude shift of the consumers will make a substantial change in their business volumes.   Grocery delivery platforms which are in operation will have a dramatic spike in sales from the newly converted customers  many of whom are first timers. After a disaster of this magnitude to the economy , consumer behaviour can take various forms. While some of these changes may end in the short run, many others will remain indefinitely in society.  Now that coronavirus is upending retail business, vendors at large must look at various methods to adapt to the new behavioural changes.Retailers must concentrate on shifting gear to new methods, how to build rapport, how to use personalization with social distancing (which will continue to exist indefinitely), how to stay ahead of competitors and so forth. I intend to discuss more on these factors in detail at a later date. Finally, my intention was to discuss the anticipated changes most likely to arise for traders, retailers in particular, in Sri Lanka. To face the challenge head on, vendors can initially concentrate and act swiftly on online selling and home delivery, change showroom to suit  new behaviour, use social media and obtain optimum mileage and  strategies in expected intense competition. "
24 January 2021,Pandemic has created new opportunities - CASL President,"The 41st National Conference of Chartered Accountants was held from January 18-20 at the Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo.State Minister of Money, Capital Markets and State Enterprise Reforms, Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Minister of Trade Bandula Gunawardena, and Chairman of the University Grants Commission, Prof. Sampath Amaratunge were present at the inauguration of the conference.The National Conference organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) which was conducted via a virtual platform for the first time in its four-decade history. Over 2,000 people including business leaders and c-suite executives from multiple industries connected with the event through the live webcast.The inauguration ceremony was held with a limited number of invitees. A line up of globally and locally acclaimed speakers and panelists steered the conference along this year’s thought-provoking theme “Abnormal: Navigating Through Shattered Norms.”President of CA Sri Lanka, Manil Jayesinghe said that while it is important to acknowledge the challenges following the pandemic, it is also essential to focus on the new opportunities the pandemic has created for businesses.“If not Covid-19 today, tomorrow we will face a new challenge, so adapting and being innovative are two ways of overcoming the challenges we face whether it be today or tomorrow.Abnormal is going to be our new normal, so we must understand the importance of being innovative and agile and embrace the abnormal while rising up to rebuild better and stronger businesses, which will be a key contributor to our economy,” he said.Jayesinghe also urged the accounting community to increasingly focus on their ethical responsibility. “Factual financial reporting and independent auditing will definitely play a key role in managing the outcomes of such a crisis.”Chairman of the National Conference Committee of CA Sri Lanka, Tishan Subasinghe said that what the world experienced during 2020 was not normal, and it may likely be a once in a lifetime experience for our generation. It has been abnormal for us but we must not forget that amid chaos we can find opportunities if we are optimistic. “The past months have been a learning curve for us. While the virus encircled us in bleakness, the truth is, it also became the hotspot for new innovations, amidst disruptions thereby creating a new paradigm shift,” he said.Chairperson of the National Conference Technical Committee Ms. Anoji de Silva said that CA Sri Lanka has adopt ‘Abnormal’ as the conference theme to challenge the negativity surrounding the word and to start a conversation within the business community on how to rethink and craft the future to build better businesses.Director, Business Development, Selyn Exporters (Pvt) Ltd, Selyna Peiris, spoke on ‘Walk the Talk,’ encouraging the corporate world to adopt a sustainable business model which gives equal importance to people, profit and the planet.During the technical sessions, speakers and panellists explored new and stronger business and professional practices to succeed in these abnormal times."
26 January 2020,EFL 3PL acquires GOTS and BSCI certifications,"EFL 3PL, a member of Expolanka PLC, was received two international certifications recently, which reflect the company’s commitment towards compliance.EFL 3PL received the Global Organic Textile Standard Certification (GOTS) for the EFL Global Freeport (EGF), which is a Distribution Centre set up to facilitate commercial hub activities such as Entrepot trade and logistics services; and the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) certification, also for EFL Global Freeport, and Orugodawatta Fulfillment Centre.The GOTS Certification is a globally-recognised textile processing standard for organic fibres, which takes into account every stage of the process to ensure organic status.

The company’s flagship facilities, Freeport in Katunayake and Finished Goods Hub in Orugodawatte have obtained an A Grade in BSCI.GOTS and BSCI are the two latest additions to a long list of compliance standards awarded to EFL 3PL.Director, EFL 3PL and Freeport, Sammy Akbar said, “Compliance is hygiene and is non-negotiable. GOTS and BSCI are key milestones on the road map of EFL 3PL in becoming the most compliant 3PL in the country. Superior adherence to compliance is vital for business continuity and brand protection, for both us and our clients.”"
22 November 2020,Being proactive in an uncertain world,"All business assumptions and anticipation in respect of the operating environment have gone for a six with Covid-19 striking us.However, it’s the leader’s dream to see all employees anticipating future changes, opportunities or problems and preparing the business for those by taking action today.They are not simply reacting to cues from the operating environment, but proactively trying to make a difference. This is crucial to succeed or survive in today’s fast changing business world with its increasingly complex work tasks.At the organisational level, adapting and reacting to changes in one’s environment is not enough; companies need to be proactive to stay ahead of competition. Reaction is costly and takes time unnecessarily and breeds de-motivation across the business organisation.It has been almost a year since Covid-19 broke out in China. And by now uncertainty has become certain. Managers have to take a stock of the fragile environment and make decisions to stay profitable in the new normal world.AnticipationFor the employee, one great way to build your image at work and gain respect and recognition is to be proactive even in a volatile situation. That means figuring out what needs to be done before it shows up on your desk as a problem of the new normal world. It’s all about anticipation of new challenges.What actions could you take to help your business, boss, your co-worker, and your business partners? Another way of looking at it is to never function in a reactive mode. Staying ahead of the curve will make your work life less chaotic. Being proactive even positions you for job advancement. Everything else being equal, proactive employees will have the edge over the others.Employees should engage in self-started, future-oriented behaviour without the need for constant direction and supervision by others. As a life discipline, employees should not simply let life happen to them but rather, should try to manage, shape, expand, and mould what happens in their lives. In other words ‘you control not be controlled’ by external factors.What it takesDive deep into the tasks you do within the work slate vis a vis the current challenges. Ask yourself what extra things you can do to ensure success of the activity you support in the value chain.The paradigm shift needed is to be clear about the outcome of the activity you are supporting, not simply do your piece of work better. Doing what you regularly do more efficiently and cost effectively may demand proactive action too but going beyond your boundary to make a greater contribution makes more sense for you and your employer.Pause for a moment and view your work from the perspective of the internal or external customers equally well. The most respected employees in the workplace are team players.Demonstrate a willingness to assist wherever and whenever needed. Do not wait for opportunities to come your way. Anticipate what’s next and take action now.Emulate others who role model proactive behavior and observe the differences in approach, style and behaviour. Chances are some of the most respected leaders in your company are proactive individuals.Observe their behaviour too. Look for an opportunity to spend a few minutes with them. Explain your desire to be consistently proactive and ask for finer advice or new pointers. Many of us look to proactive people as the instigators of action and creative ideas in society.Free spaceProactive managers care about producing their best at all times. You can prevent working in a reactive chaotic mode if you stay organised.Take the time to keep an orderly and timely work pattern to have free thinking space to be proactive amidst volatility.In the new normal world, being proactive means thinking and acting ahead of anticipated events and challenges based on the past several months experience; this means using foresight.Not only is it a great method for avoiding more work down the road, but it can be extremely important to avert disasters."
11 April 2021,The customer is always right: a controversial motto,"Most of us have heard the catchy phrase ‘The customer is always right’ and on almost all occasions as a customer, you may have felt that this applies to you. However, in reality, is this statement correct at all times? The slogan that is known to have been popularised by the respected American-British retail magnate Harry Gordon Selfridge, Sr. in the 1900s has come into criticism time and again. The idea behind this phrase is to inculcate a sense of importance to sustain the quality of the customer service provided by commercial organisations. Retention of customers for repeat business is one of the most important tasks in an organisation. Therefore, the employees of the organisation must be trained to make decisions that can benefit customers to build up loyalty. In my long experience in selling, I opine that this customer-centric ideology is still valid and relevant even as of today. However, everyone who is engaged in direct customer handling knows that this statement cannot be taken as absolute truth or certainty. In the span of my forty-year career in selling, I have come across thousands of customers with varied attitudes, characteristics, and personalities. Hence, I would say that the customer should be managed by offering him or her the center stage without consenting to every negative action of them, just because they are customers. The statement is more of a figurative motto rather than a classic golden rule. In my opinion, the statement is subjective and situational in actual application. Not in realityA key point to remember is that the customer is always right in their own mind but it may not be so in reality. Nevertheless, it is dangerous to disagree with the customer and make them argumentative or unhappy. Such action may drive them away forever. Having stated that, I must reiterate that the negative-minded customers, who most often have a justifiable reason, can be and should be handled with caution to dispel bad opinions. There are two sides to the actual meaning of the phrase. On the positive side, the most significant task of a commercial entity is to make customers happy as best as possible. Therefore, one must understand that there are many benefits when the staff of the organisation believe the sentiment that the customer is always right. It is also an absolute truth that finding a new customer is far more difficult and costlier than retaining customers. On the contrary, organisations should not accept this motto in its literal meaning as there are many misconceptions related to the statement. There are cases where customers overstep the boundaries, abuse employees, and attempt to rip off the business. Particularly, almost every customer believes the statement, whenever they become customers and sometimes demand unwarranted benefits. This is the reason that companies must train the staff to ‘manage’ customers rather than merely handling them. Critiques of the phrase say that treating customers like they are always right can be detrimental to businesses in the long run. They say that it can weaken employee morale, use up important resources and even hurt other customers.Award-winning researcher in marketing, Prof. Peter S. Fader says that not all customers deserve your best efforts. Despite the adage, customers are not always right and there are good customers and then there is everybody else.  I agree with this opinion as I have come across both types of customers.  Multiple benefits come with the ‘Customer is always right’ approach. There is no doubt that your customers are your business. The success of a business is completely dependent on customers’ trust and loyalty. Without them, the business will not survive, let alone be successful. Besides, customer feedback, whether negative or positive, can improve the quality of service tremendously.  Core ideologyCustomers’ feedback and complaints must be the core ideology and the utmost priority of everybody in the business. The important thing to understand is that if you neglect this reality, your competitors will grab them. Letting the competitors steal your customers is the most critical issue in a business. Neglecting this truth can lead to the closure of many business entities around the world. Ignoring complaints from the core customer base can turn against the business. Unattended complaints can lead to animosity and the backlash can take a long time and a lot of money to resolve. On the other hand, if the complaints and feedback are managed well, it can help identify new business lines and new revenue sources.In this internet era where your customers are becoming more personal through social media, email, texting, and live chats, the impact of unsatisfactory comments can be injurious to the business. Therefore, more refined strategies must be developed and relevant staff training must be considered to manage customers. There are always nasty, unreasonable, and irritable customers in a business. Depending on the size of the business, at least ten percent of your customers can fall into this category.  If your staff becomes too gullible on the phrase, these customers can make them miserable. I have come across such situations multiple times as a salesman and a manager.In these situations, the management has to strike a balance and support the employees. By giving adequate training on customer complaint handling, this situation can be managed for the mutual benefit of both the company and the customer. Unreasonable customersSome customers try to imply that they are more knowledgeable than your employees who know the products or services thoroughly.  Similarly, there are those who presume that they can run your business better. For example, when I was selling telephone systems for an organisation long years back, I came across one of the most respected medical professionals in the country at the time, who acted as if he knew everything about the product. He refused to accept almost every explanation I attempted to make and was compelled to act dumb and deaf to secure the sale. Ultimately, however, the said customer made a wrong buying decision. At the time, I was guided by the ‘customer is always right’ motto.  Unreasonable customers can create a bad experience not only for your staff but also for other customers.  These customers are simply not right but they are usually influenced by the phrase and presume that they are always right and the company is bound to act accordingly. They can create unpleasant and stressful situations involving other customers as well. I attempt to emphasise that even though the customers are extremely important, you have to manage them appropriately when it comes to issues. It goes without saying that the company and its staff should strive for service excellence. You should make your best attempt to make the clientele happy. However, if you always adopt the ‘the customer is right’ policy, there are chances that you may hurt the business. In such situations, you lead your employees to become disappointed and kill their morale. You will empower rude customers by setting bad examples, slow down innovation and even create unhappy situations for other customers.    Therefore, rather than acting like the customer is always right, you have to treat them the best way you can as professionals who know best about your products or services. There are many ways to manage bad customers and your employees must be made aware of those by training them. Without being unpleasant, in a helpful way, the customers must be made to understand that you are in the business of serving them to their maximum satisfaction.  "
20 December 2020,Spend wisely this season,"This has been the worst year for the majority of people. Some have lost jobs, some are still getting a cut salary, no bonus as in previous years, business income is severely down – however, your needs are still the same.With numerous promotional offers by various marketing organisations and channels, you are tempted to spend money on impulse buying though your income has been low – buying products and services that you can be without. Like your personal relationships, your financial situation can cause stress during this season. Despite restrictions, you would still like to enjoy certain activities this season too with all health precautions taken.Business organisations would plan to cash in their old stocks and recover some of the loss volumes due to the consequences of the pandemic and to increase the overall volume of business.Given that the competition gets intense with temporarily bloated needs and wants though not as elaborate as the previous years; every single business will offer various incentives to entice the customers to benefit from the seasonal demand.Certainly it’s a good idea to get the benefit from this business climate but you should use more of your head than your heart. We saw Black Friday being a big business despite the Covid-19 scare.Companies will plan to help their cash-flow sometimes below cost. While it’s a good thing for the customer to take advantage of, it can be suicidal getting caught to a vicious cycle, especially when your income has been negatively impacted and the future is not yet clear with Covid-19 predicted to be hovering around during next year too.Though you may have had more than enough time at home already, you were under tremendous stress due to uncertainties you were grappling with.The idea of a holiday season is to bring your stress level down and be rejuvenated to enhance performance post holiday season.You shouldn’t do anything that is unplanned during the holiday season and use the space meaningfully to treat you and your family well. Set aside specific days and budgets for shopping - be it online and physical, travelling, visiting friends and other activities – the Government might impose restrictions for your own good which only the time will tell us. However, pre-planning will help prevent a last-minute scramble to buy gifts, going places, visiting relatives which can be counterproductive.Make the right choiceSocial media and e-commerce platforms have become tremendously popular and you are more familiar with the systems than ever before. These platforms can entice you anytime to buy things that you never thought were necessary.Unless you know your capacity and have a budget with your reduced income this season you can easily be in trouble. Before you think of shopping, decide how much money you can afford to spend on gifts and other items. Then be sure to stick to your budget.If you don’t, you could feel anxious and tense for months afterward as you struggle to pay the bills. Learn to say no. Believe it or not, people will understand if you can’t do certain activities during this period. If you say yes only to what you really want to do, you’ll avoid feeling resentful and overwhelmed.Job perspectiveFor businesses, there is a choice to make between joining the band wagon with competitive offers vs. using the budgets when others are silent so you can stand out. It may be more profitable and effective for you to attack your competitors when they have depleted their budgets. Look at identifying your competitors’ weaknesses.

24 January 2021,DFCC Bank to support key sectors to expand business,"DFCC Bank has identified key sectors to support them in their business expansion through credit schemes which in turn will help revive the economy, said DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva in an interview with Sunday Observer Business on Friday.“The Bank has identified these sectors and senior officials are spearheading the program to support these sectors which play a pivotal role in the economy,” Silva said. Agriculture, education, healthcare and fisheries are some of the key sectors that have been identified to provide credit by the bank.“The program to support these sectors was launched early this month and we are confident it will boost economic revival measures of the government,’ Silva, who is also the chairman of the Sri Lanka Banks’ Association, said.DFCC Bank, a full-service Commercial Bank with a legacy of 65 years, extended its support in line with Government policy to help pandemic hit businesses especially SMEs by way of a moratorium and low interest loan schemes to revive enterprises. The banking sector is faced with huge challenges to ensure financial sector stability due to the moratoriums and ensuring recoveries . “The banking sector has taken a major hit due to the present crisis. All banks have deferred payments of clients up to July this year particularly for the SMEs in the tourism sector. Banks did not charge interest on capital so far and a further 24-month extension of the grace period was granted,” Silva said.However, on the low deposit rates affecting interest income dependents of the country as many bankers, Silva too accepted that low deposit rates affect this segment but said at this point of time priority has to be given to the economy rather than the welfare of a segment of the population.“The current deposit rates are in par with the Government Treasury Bill and Bond rates. Deposit rates go parallel with lending rates and are adjusted accordingly. Banks responded to rates when the regulator brought them down two to three years ago and that is how the banking sector works,’ Silva said, adding that deposit rates today are reasonable given the AWPR and AWNLR rates. The Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate is currently around six percent and the Average Weighted New Lending Rate is around 5.7 percent. “I do agree that the segment that depends on interest income too must survive. Banks do honour its commitments to deposit holders without defaulting and deferment. DFCC Bank, clinched the coveted ‘Best Post-Covid Innovation award at the Sri Lanka Association for Software Services Companies (SLASSCOM) RPA Awards 2020.The accolade was received for the ‘Automated Debt Moratorium’ initiative, which automated the process of granting moratoriums to people or businesses affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The bank reaffirmed its pledge as the ‘Bank for Everyone’, by launching the DFCC Vayapara Athwela online entrepreneurial skills development program to empower entrepreneurs, SMEs and the public.The bank recently launched the Cash Management portal, DFCC iConnect, mobile app for corporate clients. The online portal is a fully integrated Cash Management platform that enables customers to carry out daily transactions through a secure channel. "
1 March 2020,Colombo Port City: Competing with international financial centres,"The Colombo Port City (CPC) spanning 269 hectares of reclaimed land from the sea will be South Asia’s premiere residential, retail and business destination offering unmatched planned city living. The development will comprise five precincts including the financial district, central park living, island living, the marina and the international island.When completed the Port City will have over 5.6 million square metres of built space, with the best in design and standards. Its lifestyle and business offering include world class facilities and spaces in healthcare, education, entertainment, hotels and restaurants, retail and office with an integrated resort and a marina.According to the agreement reached between the Government and CHEC Port City Colombo, all 269 hectares of reclaimed land will be owned by the Government, with 91 acres for public use, 62 acres of commercial use and 116 acres to be leased by the UDA to CHEC Port City Colombo on a 99-year lease for further development. The country’s landmark project was opened to investors following a ceremony by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in December 2019.Work on the US$ 1.5 billion project resumed after renegotiating the agreement in 2016.However, ecological concerns and demand for energy and utilities have weighed in heavily on the landmark project and environmentalist and industry experts have warned of the dire consequences of the CPC on coastal and marine life.Professor in Economics, University of Colombo and Chairman, Monetary Policy Consultative Committee, Central Bank, Sirimal Abeyratne and Chairman, Sri Lanka National Arbitration Centre, Past President National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka and a leading logistics service provider, Sujeiva Samaraweera express their views.****Strive to improve it furtherSri Lanka has distinct advantages to make the Colombo Port City (CPC) an attractive business enclave in the region due its location and the ‘time-zone’ differences between the Far East and the West and the emerging Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China, said Professor in Economics, University of Colombo and Chairman, Monetary Policy Consultative Committee, Central Bank, Sirimal Abeyratne.He said the absence of a similar business enclave in the South Asian region is another reason that Sri Lanka would stand to benefit.“All these advantages matter, but they alone will not help attract investments and transform CPC to an international business enclave. The best strategy would be to declare the CPC as a Special Economic Zone and make it better than the best in the Asian region,” Prof. Abeyratne said, adding that Sri Lanka should take a cue from Singapore and Dubai and go a step further to make it even better and exploit the advantage of a ‘late comer’ before anyone else makes it. He said Sri Lanka should not forget that there would be many international business enclaves emerging in East Asia and West Asia in the years to come posing challenges to Sri Lanka’s distinct opportunity.“The absence of an investor-friendly tax policy, legal and regulatory framework are other major hurdles to position the Port City among investors. Our business environment needs major improvements. A way out to this is to make the CPC a Special Economic Zone, which would be entirely a different business enclave with an attractive regulatory and physical environment for business,” Prof. Abeyratne said.As far as the tax policies are concerned, he said steps should be taken to study such environments around us. For instance, Singapore is a free port with 99 percent duty-free imports and Dubai has only five percent duty on imports and no income and corporate taxes. If we are to make CPC a competitive business enclave in the region, we need to be bold enough to compete with them. We should not think that we are the only nation which has to make such decisions. There are many other special economic zones in this region which move in that direction. This model could be replicated in other locations such as Hambantota and Trincomalee.The human resource gap is another bottleneck that should be addressed urgently. An international business enclave is a location for ‘world-class’ businesses and services, which also need ‘world-class’ human resources.Sri Lanka has a shortage of such ‘world-class’ human resources. We need to overcome this bottleneck by allowing business entities in the CPC to bridge the gap. It is also beneficial to improve our own human resources to world standards if there are incentives to employ both together.****Important to change people’s mindsetBy Sanjeevi JayasuriyaThe Colombo Port project, when looked at from a business point of view, is of vital importance to bring economic benefits to the country, said Chairman, Sri Lanka National Arbitration Centre, Past President National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka and a leading logistics service provider, Sujeiva Samaraweera.It is necessary to upgrade facilities and services for the workers involved. The need is to give careful consideration as done in countries with similar projects such as Singapore and Korea. The 3D image of the project reflects one of international standard. With the progress of the Port City, the culture of the business community and workers will change. The project will present a scenic atmosphere.It is important to change the mindset of the people to compete with international financial centres. As a financial centre we have the location specific advantage with wide access sea routes. The country needs to upgrade infrastructure and provide ample facilities to foreigners. We need to promote the country as a neutral venue and when it comes to arbitration, it is necessary to develop a centre of international standard.The Port City needs to become the financial hub for Asian and SAARC countries. The country has a resource pool of people with high literacy and computer knowledge to bring world financial businesses to the Port City.The three pillars that the country should focus on, are, change in mindset towards advanced development, building infrastructure and creating an image as a neutral venue. It is necessary to have state-of-the art equipment, telecommunication and information communication facilities.However, with all the positive developments, the country needs to pay special emphasis during the construction process.It is necessary to protect the environment, as the environment and business go together. Environment is not only the surroundings, but also what is derived from it such as water, energy and air. These concerns have to be on top of the line decision making to transform Sri Lanka through a circular economy where the Port City could be the catalyst.“While appreciating some of the steps taken to build a world-class centre, we also need to introduce legislation as in other countries such as Germany which have similar projects to address issues regarding the protection of the environment. There will be a huge increase in demand for electricity and water.“The power demand cannot be entirely supported by the national grid. A mixed energy policy is important to run this operation efficiently.We need to understand and study the increase in demand to enable the use of modern technologies and novel building techniques. Emphasis must be paid on air and water quality and also sewerage facilities. These measures should be seriously looked at to sustain the envisaged development.The Port City project is viable, provided due attention is paid to concerns such as environment and resource consumption."
27 December 2020,Keep employee layoffs as the last resort ,"This year’s holiday season will no doubt be different - stress, anxiety, recovery, hope and optimism are some sentiments directly associated with it with no clear solution. Hope during a holiday season is a nice feeling to have – no doubt. Whether you celebrate and enjoy holidays in December or not, the way we work in 2021 will be very different and disruptive. The pandemic has had a significant impact on businesses during 2020 and more impact will be seen in 2021 too. Business will be forced to look at more concrete measures to stay profitable. Staying afloat during the initial impact to staying profitable for the medium term will be the tone of strategy for every employer.Some local organizations demonstrated best of human values by continued employment for all despite the sharp decline in revenue while some big names in the market were brutal in their decision making and paid no respect for human values. Core values of the business were totally disregarded by some hugely successful award winning large organisations. Employees were laid off, salaries were cut, benefits were withdrawn but some small and medium scale organizations demonstrated their inherent values as compared to the bigger ones. More layoffs inevitableWith Covid-19 Employment downsizing has become a fact of working life as companies struggle to cut costs and adapt to changing market demands. But does this practice achieve the desired results? Studies have tracked the performance of downsizing firms versus non-downsizing firms for as long as nine years after a downsizing event.The findings: As a group, the downsizers never outperform the non-downsizers. Companies that simply reduce headcounts, without making other changes, rarely achieve the long-term success they desire. In contrast, stable employers do everything they can to retain their employees. Employment downsizing is often implemented during pandemic driven economic downturns as a reactive, tactical action.The most successful organisations, however, use downsizing more strategically as part of an overall workforce strategy. Layoffs become just one tool in a portfolio of alternatives to improve firm performance. Management may view this as an opportunity to enhance the organisation’s medium- and long-term agility through well-planned and targeted coaching, change and career-management interventions. Firms all over the world undertake downsizing with the expectation that they will achieve economic benefits. The belief that there are only two ways to make money in business — cutting costs or increasing revenues — leads to this expectation. Anyone who pays a mortgage knows that future costs are more predictable than future revenues. Payroll expenses are fixed costs, so by cutting payroll — other things remaining equal — firms should reduce expenses. Reduced expenses translate into increased earnings. Earnings drive stock prices higher, and this makes investors and analysts happy. The key phrase above is “other things remaining equal.” Many organisations define workers only in terms of how much they cost and fail to consider the value they create. For this reason, other things often do not remain equal, so many of the anticipated benefits of employment downsizing do not materialise.Small companies demonstrate values Most global organisations use downsizing as a first response rather than as a last resort. When downsizing is a knee-jerk reaction, it has long-term costs. Employees and labour costs are rarely the true source of the problems facing an organisation. Workers are more likely to be the source of innovation, renewal and recovery.Anyone can lay off personnel, cut budgets and change an organisation chart – it’s very simple and no brainer but it takes true genius and creativity to grow a business.The ripple effects of employment downsizing are substantial — touching customers, suppliers and the local community. Try to avoid some of those effects by working with customers, suppliers and even vocational-training providers to collaborate on finding solutions. Employee morale is the first casualty in a downsizing. When a firm institutes its first round of downsizing, employees’ initial reaction is usually a sense of betrayal. Layoffs should be an organisation’s last resort for coping with challenges in its business environment. Nonetheless, most employers at one time or another find it necessary to lay off employees to handle competitive pressures or financial difficulties — or sometimes even to survive. When an organisation undergoes downsizing through layoffs, most of the HR problems that existed beforehand still exist afterward to some degree. Even if the organization becomes more streamlined, it does not necessarily see a quick improvement in productivity.The downsizing may lead to other problems, particularly the surviving employees’ attitudes and concerns about job security and workload increases.As difficult as HR’s role may be in a thriving organization, the role is no less challenging in a downsized environment because of additional tasks that HR professionals must address. They must make certain, for example, that communications related to the downsizing are ample and effective, they will help adjust job responsibilities if necessary, and they may have to help make requisite changes in compensation and benefits programs. In addition, HR will be instrumental in retraining remaining employees and in maintaining their engagement and job satisfaction. Over the long term, HR will continue to have responsibilities in retention and hiring, in customer relationships, and in evaluating systemic and individual performance.You have the right reasons to enjoy the holidays. Release your stress – spend quality time with your loved ones. Also take time to reflect on yourself. Tell yourself that 2021 is going to be seriously more challenging than 2020. So unless you become a better competitor in the New Year, you may fail in your progressive efforts to reach your goals in life. The only way to succeed with or without Covid-19 is by being a better competitor. Be determined not to be a victim of downsizing. Have yourself a goal of last to be laid-off and not the first if your organisation were to downsize to stay profitable. "

22 August 2021,Companies mobilise over Rs. 75 b via capital market,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has showcased a growth trajectory in capital raising by Sri Lankan corporates of all scales during the first seven months of this year.Sri Lankan corporates are increasingly recognising the exchange as a platform to achieve greater financial freedom, improved access to capital, enhanced global profile, access to liquidity and an attractive proposition to tap into global capital, a CSE official said. To date, the CSE has facilitated 12 new listings, including seven debt IPOs with a value of Rs. 47.29 bn, four equity IPOs with a value of Rs. 7.49 bn and 01 SPO with a value of Rs. 3.5 bn. It should be noted that this is the highest number of equity IPOs that the CSE has facilitated since 2014 and the largest in cumulative value since 2011. In total, the stock market has facilitated the raising of Rs. 77.30 bn. This includes Rs. 10.99 bn raised by Equity IPOs and the SPO, Rs. 47.29 bn raised by Debt IPOs, Rs. 16.56 bn raised by Rights Issues and Rs. 2.46 bn raised by private placements. The five equity Initial and Secondary public issues held during the year so far include Windforce PLC, Chrissworld Ltd, Prime Lands Residencies PLC, JAT Holdings Limited and Sanasa Development Bank all of which were launched with Public Issues.The first Empower Board listing, Chrissworld Limited, debuted trading successfully, which is an encouraging start for further Small and Medium Enterprise (SME)listings.With State institutions such as Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) opting to finance their capital needs through the Sri Lankan stock market, the CSE has established the confidence of both private and state institutions as an effective and efficient source for capital raising. CEO of CSE,  Rajeeva Bandaranaike said, “As businesses adopt and expand in the current environment, facilitating funding avenues is a primary priority in building a resilient economy in Sri Lanka.

10 May 2021,Upskilling and reskilling employees for the next  normal world,"We are collectively experiencing an unprecedented time - a period that will be remembered for generations and make it to every business text book of the future.Like a domino effect, countries are again being seriously affected by Covid-19 virus one after another – be it a rich country or otherwise – Western or Eastern. Apart from the massive stress of keeping themselves safe from this dreadful virus, employees are facing a unique challenge. The challenge of making themselves future-proof and elevating their skills to fast track the economy when the pandemic resides. Also, a huge section of the workforce is again vulnerable to reduced income, furloughs or layoffs as a result of the third wave in Sri Lanka.The sudden shift has naturally hampered the overall productivity of most businesses. But on the other hand, people now have more time on their hands. A lot of time is saved in commuting, socialising, and running errands which adds up to a couple of free hours every day. This is the case for the majority while a small percentage of employees in certain specific industries might be working longer hours than usual.With the first and second wave, employees were forced to learn new skills and perform jobs they would not have otherwise done. Did the organisations quantify the business value of this and formalise this for long term. Did the chief learning officers or HR folks take steps to assess the value of upskilling and reskillingRemote workingUpskilling is the process of teaching employees new skills that will help them in thriving in their job and make them more efficient.Reskilling focuses on teaching employees new and upcoming skills to do different, multi or more advanced jobs.Most global companies did this. However, did Sri Lankan companies follow this?. The significance of up-skilling and reskilling employees has increased by multi-folds. Companies that do not take this time to upskill employees will soon find themselves in a vulnerable position in the ‘next normal world’.Remote working is here to stay. But will the working style in the remote world remain the same as the traditional office?  Digital competency is a fundamental skill now but how far have we gone? Is the current workforce is digitally native enough already or do we have a way to go?The sooner we start to bridge this gap, the better will be the efficiency of the newer remote job roles. Another important pointer to remember here is that the rate of evolution in the digital world is quite high. As we enter a new level of maturity in digital transformation, the need for new and more advanced skill sets will always be there.To sustain and thrive in business  you must be early thinkers and early adopters. The economy is taking a massive hit as the pandemic continues to rise and it is going to take quite some time for the economy to bounce back even after the horror resides.To protect your business from possible market disruptions, upskilling and reskilling employees should be the first and foremost step. After you build a workforce of agile, knowledgeable, and tech-forward employees, you are in a much better position to tackle the challenges of the business world.Take this time to explore what skills that your workforce lacks and define the skills gap. Although we were anticipating a huge shift towards remote working, what we have now is completely unexpected. Your top talent understands that to survive in this new world, they must equip themselves with skills of the future. Hence, there is no better way to retain your top than to encourage reskilling and upskilling. Even if the company goes through a hiring freeze, your knowledgeable and agile employees will be able to meet the business needs.Retaining top talent through hard times is important so that, when you are back to business as usual, you’re able to scale up as quickly as possible with the best talent. How teams communicate and work together will determine the chances of survival of a business in this crisis.Employee motivationIt is time for the organisation to bring all the departments together such as HR, Sales and Marketing, Finance, Production and formulate a strategy to overcome the Covid 19 surge. Reskilling and Upskilling can help employees to better understand various job roles in the organisation. This will then lead to strong cross-functional teams in the workforce.Lack of human interaction often leads to feelings of isolation and hopelessness among your people. Uncertainty about the future, personal, and financial safety are prevalent thoughts.When the organisation invests in reskilling and upskilling it can go a long way. It builds the right mindset, greater team collaboration, employee loyalty and greater employee satisfaction."
19 January 2020,CSE expects new listings in second quarter,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) will record some new listing probably after the second quarter this year following the General Elections to be held soon, said CSE Chairman Ray Abeywardena on the sidelines of the bell ringing ceremony held last week to mark the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants’ (CIMA) centenary last year.“We expect new listings in the CSE after the elections with some stability ensured in the country,” Abeywardena said, adding that certain rules will be relaxed in the Empower Board to encourage more companies especially tech entities to come in.He said the recent purchase of a Rs. 22.6 billion stake in John Keells Holdings PLC by the Citi Group’s Global Markets Limited was a boost to the capital market. The transaction marked the second single largest stake to be bought in a decade.The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants’ (CIMA) UK which was launched in 1919 marked its centenary year last year while CIMA Sri Lanka set up in 1965 turns 55 this year."
10 May 2021,Chinese help Indian expats send home life-saving equipment,"* As India is engulfed by a second wave, Chinese are helping Indian expats source oxygen concentrators from factories or Taobao and send them home* China is the world’s biggest manufacturer of oxygen concentrators, but deteriorating ties between Beijing and New Delhi means sourcing them has become complicatedThe death toll began to pile up in Ritwick Ghosh’s social circle back in India. First a college friend succumbed to Covid-19, then a close friend’s sister, then another lost a family member. “As long as there is no name or face, it is just a statistic,” he said from Shanghai. “The moment there is a name and a face, it is no longer a statistic.”Ghosh works for one of the biggest investment funds in China and has lived in the mainland for over a decade. Over the past 10 days, as the devastating second wave of the pandemic sweeps through his homeland, he has been familiarising himself with oxygen concentrators – machines that relieve the stress from the lungs and have the potential to save lives.“Think of it as an air purifier,” Ghosh said. “Until now I did not even know what the optimum level of oxygen concentration should be in our blood.”Across India, the demand for medical oxygen continues unabated, with hospitals putting out SOS messages for supplies and people taking to social media to plead for oxygen to keep loved ones alive.Oxygen concentrators have therefore become sought-after devices as they can be operated from home and can aid those who have saturation levels between 88 and 92. Experts say one concentrator could service three patients per month.Other Indians living in China like Ghosh have been buying oxygen concentrators off Taobao, a popular Chinese e-commerce site, and sending them to India. Couriering a 30kg package containing a 10 litre unit costs anything from 3,200 to 10,500 yuan (US$500-1,600).China is the world’s biggest manufacturer of oxygen concentrators. But sourcing them has become complicated, given the deteriorating relations between New Delhi and Beijing following a tense 2020 that saw clashes at their Himalayan border.Despite Chinese ambassador to India Sun Weidong tweeting about Covid-19 relief supplies being sent, Indian media reports suggest these supplies were commercial procurements and not sent on humanitarian grounds. China, however, maintains it is still waiting on India to accept its offer of help.In this context, people such as Ghosh have become go-betweens. “I am just facilitating information between people who need it in India and suppliers here,” he said. “Many Indians have already tried to order concentrators online or even spoken to Chinese suppliers directly. But since the trust factor is still low between the two countries, they approach me to speak in Mandarin. The mental effort is lower when they know someone who is sitting in China can help.”Full capacityChinese factories producing oxygen concentrators are currently running at full capacity, said Hao Nan, a Suzhou-based volunteer and founder of Zhuoming Info Aid, which has been involved in humanitarian relief efforts for other countries hit by the virus, including Italy, Spain, Iran and France.Using resources from the site Covid19india.org, he and other volunteers have been trying to get a clearer picture of what is needed in which Indian city.Last year, soon after the worst was over in Wuhan, he and a group of Chinese volunteers compiled a document detailing their experiences in combatting the virus. “A year ago, we tried to deliver our experiences from Wuhan especially for volunteer groups across the world. But I guess it is hard for people to learn from other people.”For now, Hao is focused on procuring supplies. “Just this evening, I tried to order 100 oxygen concentrators but to no avail,” he said via Zoom. “I know many of my friends in the non-profit area in China who are trying their best to help Indian friends to purchase oxygen concentrators.”There are no more than 10 factories that can produce the 10-litre machine, he said. These are spread across Shenyang and parts of Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces.“Getting our hands on oxygen concentrators is proving to be very difficult,” said Sridhar Srinivasan, an engineering manager at a tech company in Shanghai, who like Ghosh is also catering to individual requests from India. “They are all sold out and the ones who claim to have stock, we don’t know if they really have stock, or they will just take the money and not deliver.” It costs around 3,000 yuan (US$500) for a five-litre unit.A week ago, Srinivasan and his wife started to think about how to get more seriously involved in relief work after renowned Tabla maestro Pandit Sarit Das died of Covid-19 in India. Das used to teach the Indian musical instrument at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing.“Pandit Das was among the unfortunate people who were locked out from returning to China last year. His death hit very close to our hearts,” said Srinivasan. “I know so many people who have had losses. Everywhere you turn, you see news that is really distressing coming out of India.”Practical issuesOn April 30, the Indian government allowed faster customs clearance on imports of critical care medical equipment including oxygen concentrators, which spurred efforts to send single units from China.“Through a courier channel, a couple of us are piloting an initiative where we purchase oxygen concentrators via Taobao and courier them to trusted people in India who can lend it out like a library to whoever needs it,” Srinivasan said. “If it succeeds, we can scale it up.” The team sent out 20 units to individual recipients on Thursday. There are practical issues with sourcing from the Chinese market though, as instructions might be entirely in Chinese and some of the products are not eligible for export.The Indian Association, Shanghai, has also been actively involved in the effort. The 25-year-old association, which runs under the patronage of the Consulate General of India in Shanghai, has actively fundraised for previous disasters and has organised blood donation drives and cultural events featuring Bollywood starsMembers started feeling “tremors” when friends and family back in India began to fall sick. “We raised almost 1.5 million rupees (US$20,000) in four days in the first phase of funding,” said association president Mukesh Sharma. This included donations from Chinese friends and colleagues.The team placed an order for 35 units of 10-litre oxygen concentrators and hope to ship these to India by May 15. “The number of oxygen concentrators is increasing if we aggregate all the demands, so we are discussing the possibility of running a chartered Air India flight,” Shama said.To avoid falling prey to fly-by-night operators taking advantage of the soaring demand for oxygen concentrators, a board member of the association flew out to a factory for a quality check.Primary school teacher Maitreyee Ray, who lives in Guangdong with her husband, a manager in a Chinese textile company, has sent one concentrator to India so far. “Some Indians in Guangdong have come together as a group and extended their hand in support,” she said.“As long as our people in India are not safe, we will definitely help. We are safe, we are enjoying life here, but they are suffering. My daughter is there, my father is there, and I am terrified for their safety.”Ray and her husband rode out the pandemic in China. She commented on the discipline with which Chinese people used face masks. “Even today everyone wears a mask. Even if you just go downstairs for a walk, everyone wears a mask. Even a child in a pram has a mask on.”- South China Morning Post"
22 November 2020,Business friendly - CCC,"The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce welcomes the proposals in Budget 2021 which are business friendly, production oriented and demonstrative of policy continuity. The Budget has focused on boosting economic growth by enhancing exports, providing investment relief for key thrust sectors supplemented by public investment proposals, promoting capital markets and supporting the growth of Startups and SMEs.The emphasis on tax policy continuity and measures announced to strengthen tax administration demonstrates a strong commitment to policy consistency while strengthening and broad basing revenues.The Chamber in its Pre-Budget proposals highlighted the importance of the Government maintaining the current tax laws and rates at least for the next five years or so thereby providing the necessary consistency in tax policy. The adoption of a consistent tax policy under the National Budget 2021 would not only provide a platform for proper planning for business but would also help the Government in long term cash flow planning and strengthening fiscal consolidation.The Chamber also welcomes the tax relief for investment in machinery and equipment for domestic manufacturing and exports and the relaxing of import restrictions on certain sectors in line with past recommendations by the Chamber.Proposals on enhancing Digital governance, investments in technology and infrastructure including rural connectivity to facilitate digital inclusion are also notable. The Chamber trusts that the positive benefits accrued from the macro stability set out by National Budget 2021 will provide a foundation for sustainable growth acceleration over the medium and long-term as envisaged."
7 March 2021,Motivation is not about a pat on the back,"Contrary to the popular belief that motivating people is all about appreciating people and pulling up people for weaknesses and negligence, de-motivate people, the fact remains that you cannot change bad people to be good unless you are direct and openly offer your feedback. Without differentiating performance of people – say good for good and bad for bad – you will not be able to achieve business results.The general notion of motivating people is to pat the back is a bygone theory and it does not work that way. Most Sri Lankan leaders try to be popular by only appreciating people and ignoring bad performance and performers. The loss of business value due to this typical Sri Lankan leadership attitude is enormous. The world is full of uncertainties. A leader’s role is to bring about certainty out of uncertainty. Given the erratic nature of the economy, which on a daily basis dictates and significantly changes the operating environment for business organisations, both employers and employees are faced with the challenge of having to constantly adapt to meet challenges head-on, and to figure out new ways of working.Sustaining performanceThe work environment for employees is fast-paced, dynamic and challenging one making your strategies and value propositions short-lived, so you need constant creativity, analytical thinking, continuous improvements and correct speed of execution to improve or sustain performance.To succeed as a manager you need to grow yourself and when you become a manager, success depends on how you grow your team members. Challenging employees to reach their best potential is one good way of growing them. Employees have the potential to do more than they think and it is not until they enter the working world that many slowly begin to discover that.An employee who recognises the value of a challenge, and experiences the personal and professional growth through overcoming the challenge, is an employee who will develop a positive and realistic self-worth, as well as an understanding that personal achievement and business achievement are inextricably linked. Managers have widely divergent ideas about what really motivates the team mates, with some managers ending up in avoidance mode. Most performance problems aren’t dealt with directly.More often, instead of taking action, the manager will transfer the person somewhere else or match the work to his capacity. Most leaders are trying to combine a mix of challenge and support to get the best out of their teams.Achieving this balance is never easy, and is specific to each individual. But in the end, growing others is a worthwhile effort for both noble and self-interested reasons. It’s personally rewarding to help others accomplish more than they’d thought possible. Raise the barRaise the bar, create a sense of internal competition, differentiate and pay for performance and reward excellence. Performance differentiation is the best way to motivate the high performers.When an organisation creates such a performance culture, employees at the bottom end will have to either catch up to match up or give up the competition and look elsewhere. Managers should distinguish those who would like to stay in the game from people who are unwilling to compete and deal with the two categories appropriately.Challenging employees can also provide the benefit of increasing their level of job satisfaction. There are a number of ways to challenge an employee; whichever method you use, make sure the employees feel like the process is intended to help them and not to penalise anyone.Job rotation is a good way to build capacity in employees and it prevents the boredom and stagnation that can occur from repeatedly performing the same tasks. Job rotation challenges and stimulates workers by offering them the opportunity to learn new job functions and develop their skills, which also makes them more valuable assets to your organisation. Workers who seek advancement opportunities may view job rotation as a way to become more attractive managerial candidates, as they will develop a broader perspective of how the organisation functions.Performance feedbackEncouraging innovation and creativity can lead to ideas that can help your business grow. Challenge your employees to become innovators by starting an idea generation program where employees are rewarded for ideas that are eventually adopted and implemented by your company.Rewards can take the form of monetary compensation or public recognition, or the opportunity for the creator to lead a team charged with bringing the idea to fruition. Increase employee engagement by involving them in the decision-making process.For instance, have a trusted employee sit in on a job interview to provide input about the candidate’s suitability for the position, as well as how he might fit in with the team. By increasing your employees’ engagement level, they will feel they have a greater stake in the direction of the company, which can challenge and motivate them. Managers have tremendous power simply by being in a position of authority, and can use their words to influence how others view themselves. The act of expressing belief in your employees and focusing on setting high, but achievable standards for them has real repercussions. When we communicate to an employee, we too often leave out the potential we see in them to be successful. We may challenge them but not say why we’re sure they can do it. Instead, consider the idea that if you see something praiseworthy, innovative, or potential-enhancing from your team members, call it out."

26 July 2020,  Tech savvy job losers to gain during crisis,"The loss of jobs during the pandemic can be converted into a golden opportunity by boosting entrepreneurship among those who are out of jobs, Co-Founder and CEO of Takas.lk, Lahiru Pathmalal told Sunday Observer Business.The owner of the popular e-commerce platform said that being technology savvy will be an added advantage when doing business amidst the covid crisis.""My advice, if you have lost your job and are redundant, is to use the time to look at entrepreneurship with special attention to technology. For instance, if you have some basic knowledge of coding, you are on a  good wicket,"" he said.As major companies are showing a lacklustre attitude to  develop e-commerce platforms, Pathmalal believes that young entrants to the industry have a better chance to succeed.  “In the best case scenario people would buy things online while working from home. But to derive maximum benefits a strong emergence of e-commerce is necessary. But such an emergence is really challenging. Even big supermarket chains are pleased to see people walk into their outlets. At Takas we sell electronic products. Even though we wish to get into retail business, it is hard for us,” Pathmalal said adding, “There is a strong possibility of another lockdown soon after the election. Hence the market opportunity for e-commerce is high. Therefore, in the next 18 to 24 months if you are to sell something, e-commerce is a definite recipient.”Asked about assistance from the local banking system to online entrepreneurs during the pandemic, Pathmalal said, “The problem primarily is the fact that there is no cash flow in businesses."
27 September 2020,CSE and SEC launch real estate investment trusts,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) launched Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) which gives average investors an opportunity to reap the benefits of real estate investments and the advantages associated with investing in publicly traded securities on the CSE.While investing in real estate appears to be a popular choice, the rising cost of property poses a significant challenge to individual investors who typically resort to bank loans to finance such investments.This timely introduction by the CSE and SEC provides greater access to all investor segments to invest in commercial real estate projects and an opportunity to benefit from the spiraling property prices.REITs were first introduced in the United States in 1960 creating a mechanism for individual investors, especially middle-income earners, to generate income by investing in large commercial real estate. This product has made rapid progress within Asian markets as well with its growing popularity especially in Thailand, Malaysia and India and is also viewed as a mechanism to broadbase real estate ownership within a country. A REIT is a structure which typically owns and operates income-generating real estate. The income-generating real estate assets owned by a REIT may include office buildings, shopping malls, apartments, hotels, resorts, self-storage facilities and warehouses.A REIT would enable unit holders to earn a portion of the income that is generated through renting, leasing or selling these properties which needs to be distributed directly to the unit holders of the REIT.The CSE and SEC have introduced a framework which mandates the distribution of 90% of the generated income to investors.This innovative introduction, which has been formulated specifically taking into consideration the local environment, would open new horizons for real estate developers and owners to convert completed income generating projects into a REIT, have its units listed on the CSE following the mechanism now made available to them and have them publicly traded in the secondary market, similar to equity securities listed on the CSE.The framework for REITs has been introduced by the SEC via rules made by the SEC in terms of Section 53 and 13 of the SEC Act which came into effect on July 31, in the form of a Gazette notification.The comprehensive set of SEC rules will govern the overall mechanism of REITs in Sri Lanka. The CSE has also formulated Listing Rules for the listing of units of REITs. A REIT would enable investors to further diversify their portfolios by investing in this lucrative investment vehicle which would produce long-term returns. Investors would benefit from a stable stream of income, swift entry and exit route through the secondary market and also benefit from the returns of overall real estate asset appreciation.The economy at large would also benefit from the introduction of REITs with the anticipated creation of jobs, economic growth, increased tax revenue, liquidity through listing and would also attract foreign direct investments into the country. REITs would also need stronger corporate governance and increased transparency which would help the investor community and regulatory bodies to assess the viability and quality of projects.Similar to any stock market investment, the investor needs to take into account his or her own financial status and also consult an investment advisor before making an investment decision.A review can also be carried out on the REIT’s disclosure filings, including the annual and quarterly reports, before investing in REITs.The CSE and SEC will continue to focus on setting up a more conducive environment along with the regulatory authorities to facilitate greater company and investor participation."
29 December 2019,Opinion : Global crisis on the horizon,"The situation in the financial markets in the US and Europe seems to point to a far more bigger global crisis looming on the horizon. The banking sector, in particular, with the envisaged zero and negative interest rates, poses a threat to depositors at large because they stand to lose interest gains as clients will have to pay banks for simply parking their cash.The capital of clients will see a decline over the years with increasing negative interest rates now being contemplated. The core business of commercial banks is lending and earning a profit on interest. With a zero interest scenario, the outlook for this type business is grim, and it looks as if the prognosis of Bill Gates is now becoming more a reality.Twenty years ago, Bill Gates remarked, “Banking is necessary, banks are not”, as if he had foreseen the current trends emerging with the appearance of Bitcoin, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay and Libra – the latest crypto currency invention of the Facebook Group.Europe and the US are simply over-banked, and as a result, the natural correction through market reactions is now happening exactly as predicted. Banks, on the other hand, have no options as a sudden increase of interest rates would automatically trigger a domino crash effect for approximately 15% of commercial enterprises in the EU region alone.The 15% comprise commercial enterprises categorised by rating agencies as ‘zombies’, and under normal market conditions should have long gone bust. Instead, they are artificially kept alive and the low bank interest rates keep them going for now.There are clear indications that many big commercial banks are in deep trouble. In Germany, the second biggest bank Commerzbank recently announced 8,000 job cuts throughout its branch network.The popular German rural bank chain Sparkasse is poised to merge with the second biggest rural bank chain Volksbank by cutting 20% of their existing branches across Germany. Banks generally merge when the markets don’t provide sufficient business to them.One of the most critical indicators on where the banking sector stands is reflected in the Repo market, which means Re-Purchasing Market. It’s the Repo market, which provides short-term funding that banks and financial counter-parties regularly tap to lend each other trillions.This vital sector has suddenly hit financial news headlines for all the troubling reasons. Usually, big commercial banks lend substantial amounts of money under a ‘one night lending scheme’ to one another. This business of short, overnight lending goes largely unnoticed in the US though the cash volumes are enormous, ranging anything between US$ 30 and 40 billion on a single night transaction.The banks lend on collateral securities, which are bonds in general, to another bank and vice versa, while the interest rates have generally remained in the range of 2% to 3% for the past 10 years. Some weeks ago, even to the surprise of the US FED, the demand for one-day overnight Repo’s went through the ceiling with volumes spiking to US$ 70 billion plus and collateral interest asked for going up to 10%. And as at today, the current lending ratio has hit the ceiling with more than 100 billion USD for an overnight lending scheme.Higher interestBanks generally ask for higher interest rates if the risk scenario demands it and the assessment of the credibility of banks correlates in general with the interest rates. But what is the Repo market, anyway, and why has the Federal Reserve Bank injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system to stabilise it?Repo’s (short for repurchase agreements) are short-term borrowing transactions, often made overnight. Think of them as trades of cash for some kind of collateral. In a Repo transaction, the borrower will sell certain securities in their possession with the agreement to buy them back the following day. If the transaction is not rolled over, then the trade has to be settled the next day, with the borrower repurchasing the collateral from the lender for slightly more than it had previously sold it for, compensating the lender with interest for taking on the risk.Large corporations and banks typically hold vast quantities of highly liquid financial assets, and they use the markets as a means of quick and easy financing. In fact, there are over $1 trillion worth of overnight Repo transactions collateralised with the US government debt occurring daily. Banks frequently go to these markets to fund the loans they issue, and to finance the trades they execute.The Repo market seized up end of September 2019 with median repurchase rates skyrocketing from the usual band of 2.00-2.25% to 2.46% and 5.25%. Keep in mind, that’s the median rate. Some Repo rates were as high as 9%, more than quadruple the Federal Reserve’s own target rate, which usually puts a cap on how high Treasury REPO rates could climb.The big demand was explained as an unlucky confluence of events, including an exceptionally large demand for cash from US companies that needed to pay their corporate tax bills, sucked in a lot of the available cash out of the financial markets. However, these periodic tax bills occur year by year and quarter yearly, but nothing of this nature had happened during the past 10 years after the 2008 crash.That’s supply and demand, plain and simple, and it mirrors what happened in certain Repo markets in 2007 before the housing crash and the Great Recession that followed. So, what happened to the usual abundance of cash and liquid securities that powers the trillion-dollar Repo market?It has been gradually evaporating for some time since the Fed ended the policy of quantitative easing (QE) five years ago; its maneuver to buy highly liquid bank securities to boost overall bank reserves. The thinking (and hope) of the controversial policy was that the increased liquidity would encourage banks to lend more and spur economic growth at the depths of the downturn.Bank reservesSuch accommodative actions have been seen for some time now, and total bank reserves have steadily been decreasing. They peaked in August, 2014, and are now close to where reserves were in 2011. One principle reason for this was an elevated level of government debt issuances in the past four years, which sucked reserves out of the financial system.When a squeeze like the one witnessed at end September occurs, it’s a clear indicator that there aren’t enough reserves in the financial system for Repo markets to clear at the Fed’s preferred level — in central bank parlance, the ‘target rate’ or the FED Funds rate. That explains why the central bank has been engaged in open market operations to inject reserves back into the banking system through overnight purchases of Treasuries.Even though the Fed has routinely used open market operations in the past to stabilize the funding markets, it doesn’t look like a few routine interventions will be sufficient.It’s becoming increasingly clear that banks need more reserves on hand. The Fed pledged to allow around two more weeks of overnight Repo transactions, each injecting around $75 to 100 billion daily into the economy, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a recent news release.As plumbing problems go, this will be an expensive one to sort out or an indication that the ‘Big Crash’ is happening soon.Coming back to the European scenario, on the German Banks Index, the picture and the statistics are more than alarming. The Banking Index in between 2005 and 2009 showed at its highest over 700 points to crash. At the end of 2009, it was down to a mere 89 points.In 2019, the German Banks Index even surpassed the lowest Bank Index of the crash period in 2009, and records 65 points, as at today. The miracle is that the banks are still operative, no bailouts as such have happened though the sector has already virtually gone bust.Coming to Sri Lanka’s banking sector, it should be examined to what extent the country is exposed and will be affected by a possible banking crash in the US and Europe. How deep are Sri Lanka’s banks exposed to adventures into risky or highly speculative overseas investments is hopefully under the strict control of Sri Lanka’s Central Bank. The Ceylinco crash hopefully taught us a good lesson.The writer is a German investor, tourism promoter and social scientist based in Sri Lanka "
12 June 2021,Natural disasters and business response,"The Covid-19 challenge was compounded by the torrential rains in 10 districts ravaging assets and amplifying challenges for businesses. We don’t know what is next.The frequency and magnitude of natural disasters are on the rise beyond comprehension, costing enormous amounts of money and also severely impacting the lives of humans, animals and the environment.  Recovering from a disaster of this magnitude demands a huge effort and is usually a gradual process. Safety is the primary issue, as are mental and physical well-being. The emotional toll that disaster brings can sometimes be even more devastating than the financial strains of damage and loss of home, business or personal property. The stress caused following a natural disaster can lead to burnout and physical, mental and emotional exhaustion. Action planSurely you need to develop an action plan - decide who’s going to do what and when. Summarise your financial situation and discuss your options with your bank or financiers to alleviate stress of any financial concerns, so  you will know to draw up your recovery plan after you have assessed the level of physical damage. Psychological recovery leads to physical, so start with a strong mind and emotional strength. Extended family and friends can help you – it makes a difference when you know you have people to share your emotions with. They and strong support networks that come into action in such situations can provide emotional and practical support. Share, explain and tell them exactly how they can help. Economic recoveryIn the wake of climate-related disasters, rebuilding is never a matter of putting back the structures that were there before. It needs to address the intangible, too, beginning with carefully considered strategies for economic recovery.In plotting a way forward for economic recoveries in the future, there are important and useful lessons to be learned from the past events and experiences.Such disasters are often seen as providing a chance to “build back better” — better housing, roads, schools and hospitals for the long term.Rebuilding housing and public infrastructure to higher standards of safety that reduce disaster risk is vital.  It minimises human and economic losses in future events and helps soften the fear and trauma of survivors as they re-emerge into social and economic life. Building back better is sometimes seen as an opportunity for a disaster-struck country to make a ‘developmental leap’ by creating, for instance, more solid infrastructure that would not have existed in the absence of the disaster. If this is not done in a way that matches the availability of local capabilities, however, recovery will falter. So ‘building back adequately’ could be what is most needed for ravaged economies.Help othersThe speed of recovery matters but quality of recovery is equally important as it’s the quality that will determine the rate of success.Devastation of this scale demands a coherent effort. The Government or any single organisation cannot single handedly help in this situation. Every single person has a contribution to make. Even the most developed countries need assistance for the affected from the non-affected in multiple ways.We have already seen many heartwarming examples. Sri Lankans have repeatedly proved that we are a nation that naturally comes together leaving behind all differences to help each other. Helping another at a time of such need is the best thing a human can do. Do your utmost generously in kind, manpower and time. The underlying theme of sustainability is growing together for everyone’s well-being."

3 January 2021,Injecting money has short-term benefits but risky in the long run - Economist,"The Modern Monitory Theory (MTT) which the Government considers a solution to the debt crisis could be beneficial in the short-term but risky in the long term, said Dr. Anil Jayantha of the University of Sri Jayawardenepura.MMT is a strategy associated with financialisation which in turn pumps excessive cash into the economy, he said. It is clear that the biggest issue the Government is facing is the debt crisis and under the present state of the economy the Government has limited solutions. The Government is turning to MMT which means printing money as it needs to finance Government expenditure on the assumption that such expenditure will boost the economy. But the risk of this policy is that it could lead to hyper-inflation or a bubble crash, he said.According to the Central Bank, the Government expects to cut the share of foreign debt to 40 percent in 2021 from 45 percent in 2020. Mathematically this would be true when the proportion of local borrowings is increased. However, the country needs to earn foreign currencies to settle foreign loans and will not be able to repay foreign debts by printing local currency. Countries such as the USA can do this as the dollar is accepted globally and eventually a dollar note becomes a commodity.“The Government’s ability in foreign borrowings has been limited as the credit rating of the country has been downgraded to risky level. Hence, International Sovereign Bonds (ISB) has limited demand.“It is evident from the fact that the Government was unable to issue a single ISB in 2020 even though it has been issuing ISB continuously from 2009. Then the only option available to the Government is to borrow locally. “With the knowledge of the Government’s ability to print money, creditors are understandably willing to accept mostly lower returns but at low risk on Government Bonds than on other investments and help the growth of the economy. This is a basic argument on the advantage of MMT, Dr. Jayantha said.There is a theoretical argument on this strategy as the excess money is expected to create more jobs, push the aggregate demand up, increase production and then achieve economic growth. These assumptions would hold good only under certain situations and only for a short period. At this juncture in Sri Lanka, what matters is not simple injection of cash in to the economy but implementation of a comprehensive and integrated plan to increase production based on local demand and changing global demands and opportunities.Additional cash pumped would either be idle or beat around the stock market and further pave the way for more corruption and will never have an assurance of achieving economic growth. It seems like the Government has simply taken only the theoretical arguments behind MMT in to consideration and not the prevailing situation of the country, Dr. Jayantha said. Of cause any Government can print money excessively to meet government expenditure by disregarding dare economic consequences for which people will have to pay the price collectively.This strategy does not have any solution even theoretically to face the foreign debt crisis as local money printing will never honour settlements of foreign debts which have to be settled in foreign currencies. However, he said that there are limitations and serious negative consequences. Economies such as Sri Lanka are more likely to end up with a crisis of currency devaluation, debt default and hyperinflation."

4 July 2021,"Colombo Port City: Wake up, dream on to reality – Part 1","This article provides an overview on the recent talk of the town “The Colombo Port City”. This may appear to be mind-numbing or may not be interesting owing to the fact that it is imperative to include a few economic terms and jargon to emphasise on the real or practical meaning or the importance of the same. No theories or law points are discussed here as the intention was to shed a light on salient features and a simple understanding to layman on the Project. It is my personal belief that many people are holding on to different opinions on the Project whether favourably or unfavourably as a consequence of unacquaintance or no or little access for right information. Some accuse China gratuitously and wrongfully portraying a ‘debt-trap diplomacy’: enticing poor, developing countries into agreeing for large scale development projects backed by unsustainable loans so that they can acquire the assets on default resulting unimpeded military reach for which the evidence are very little as oppose to the colonials we had thus far around the world.Some are under the impression that we are a country blessed with a vast range of natural resources reserves such as petroleum, gas, uranium, gold, coal, copper and silver. And further are in the belief of that such resources are readily available for us to reap the benefits and to be secluded from the rest of the world. But the reality is that we are only in possession of graphite as a deposit of mineral and forests with least disturbed and biologically unique and very high level of diversification as natural resources. North Korea is currently holds the largest and one of the finest available graphite reserves. However, owing to closed economic policies and as they are isolated from rest of the world, they send part of their production only to the Chinese market. Hence we are fortunate enough to be retain our position among the first ten producers in the world for graphite. Except graphite, we are not in possession of any such valuable, marketable and natural resources reserves with scale advantages. Hence, it is a must for a country like us to find alternative avenues to source dollar income. In this sense, “The Colombo Port City” will emerge as a golden opportunity for us to make a major leap in the economy. Below are the reasons for me to bear such a view in this regard. What is “The Port City”?The Port City or the Colombo Port City is a man-made island (Reclaimed land) located adjacent to the Galle Face Green, Colombo which is currently under the development by CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd. (CPCC). Land reclamation is a process of creating a new land raising the elevation of a water-bed or a low-lying land. The Palm Jumeirah of Dubai is a well-known and classic example for one such successful development.Even though we call it “Port City” in short, the entity’s lawful name is “The Port City Colombo Development Project (PCCDP)”. It is a project by The CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd. with an initial investment as gigantic as USD 1.4 billion which planned in reclaiming 269Ha of land. It is planned to be utilised as a “Specialized Economic Zone” which is a new and widely used in most developed and developing economies as an investment promotion tool. After a fairly long embryonic gestation period, the project’s land reclamation was over by 2019. Currently the basic infrastructure is being developed. As per the Development Control Regulations (DCR), the reclaimed land will comprise Gross Floor Area (GFA) of 6.9Mn sq.m. (including car parks) which includes commercial space, retail space, residential, hospital, convention, exhibition centre and hospitality with state of the art social infrastructure. It is a Public Private Partnership (PPP - Public - Private Partnership involve collaboration between a government or its agency and a private-sector company that can be used to finance, build and operate projects) arrangement with the Government of Sri Lanka and CHEC Port City Colombo Pvt Limited to invest USD 1.4Bn in return for 99 years leasehold rights for 116Ha of reclaimed land (the total extent is 269Ha). CHEC Port City Colombo Private Limited is a subsidiary of China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) and Communications and Constructions Company Limited the (CCCC) is the parent company of CHEC. CCCC is a multinational engineering and construction company with its global presence across 135 countries and possesses about 103 branches and offices to serve them. CCCC is an internationally renowned company which is listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The CCCC was ranked as the 93rd by Fortune 500 Companies in 2019. It was positioned third by the Engineering New record (ENR) out of 250 international contractors in 2018.The Shantou New East Coastal Area Development Project and Guangzhou Nansha New District Development Project are some most notable work done by the CCCC. The CCCC has its presence in Sri Lanka since 1998. They contributed to projects such as Southern Highway, Outer Circular Highway, Hambantota Port, Mattala Airport and Colombo South Container Terminal. In an economic perspective, it can be envisaged that the Port City would result in having significant positive impact on creating employment, attracting FDIs, contribution towards GDP, managing BOP and increase in government income. Employment opportunitiesThe reclamation, infrastructure development and attracting investors are being done now and at this stage, it is expected to create 6,400 employment opportunities and with related to construction, it will be about 160,172 man-hours (direct and indirect) and creation of  skilled and unskilled job opportunities over 210,355 is expected. The job opportunities will be created in sectors such as hospitality and leisure, education, health and retail.When looking at Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), at the reclamation and common infrastructure development stage, it is estimated to receive USD 4.1Bn (including the initial investment of USD 1.4Bn by CPCC). Thereafter it is expected to attract USD 2.7Bn through land leases. (Rs. 13Mn p.p which may differ at the time of enacting the actual lease). During the construction stage it is planned to attract USD 5.6Bn (assuming at least 75 percent of the construction cost being foreign funded) and when the entities commenced the operations, it is expected to reinvest about USD 0.7Bn per annum back within Sri Lanka. The value addition for GDP through the CPC is twofold; i.e. investment and consumption. During the phase of reclamation and infrastructure development, construction and leasing out the lands, it is anticipated to contribute USD 4.6 Bn and USD 13.0Bn. And through the operational stage, it is expected to have USD 11.8Bn annually mainly by the rent income of retail, commercial and residential space with the Port City. Even though the construction stage consists of considerable outflows arising through importation of raw materials for construction, this will get offset with the recurrent rent income inflows over the space. When considering the export services, inbound tourism spending as well, we can expect the total cash flows to pave a way to a considerable positive impact towards managing Balance of Payment.  Government revenue inflows can be derived through lease rent over marketable land, import duties, income tax, value added tax, and licensing fees and expected to be around USD 0.8Bn.Incorporating the concept of township planning, the total land extent has been divided into five distinctive zones as per the Development Control Regulations (DCR), namely the Financial District - 40Ha, Marina District - 15Ha, Central Park Living - 95Ha and Central Living - 85Ha. Upon the completion of the land reclamation, the project was officially handed over to the Urban Development Authority (UDA) in October 2019.As mentioned earlier, a tripartite agreement has been entered in to by the GoSL, CPCC (CHEC Port City Colombo Private Limited) and Urban Development Authority (UDA and Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development).The GoSL holds 57 percent of the reclaimed land (Common area 34%, marketable land 23% ) and as the developer and in return to the investment they made, 43% of the reclaimed land is held by CPCC on a 99-year lease basis. The CPCC is to be involved in sales and marketing and setting up the Estate the Management Company (EMC - joint venture between CPCC and GoSL to maintain common infrastructure) and the development of International Financial Centre.  The Port City Colombo the joint investment project by CHEC and GoSL will undeniably become a golden turning point of the economy of Sri Lanka. To be continued next week"
17 May 2020,Economics of social media based business during crises,"In January 2018, there were six million active social media users in Sri Lanka, accounting for 30% of the population. The prominence of social media as a platform for information exchange – globally and in Sri Lanka - is well documented.The current Covid-19 pandemic is probably the first major global crisis to take place in the social media age. Social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter, which did not exist or was at a nascent stage during previous global crises, such as the September 11 terrorist attacks or the 2008 financial crisis, are currently facilitating important conversations about the pandemic.At the same time, it has also become a hotbed for disinformation and sensationalism. The unprecedented level of information available to social media users, however, has also created opportunities for broader usage of these platforms for activities such as contact tracing and economic activity. Given the complete cessation of usual business practices in Sri Lanka for the past six weeks, due to prolonged curfew, businesses of all sizes have begun to use social media as their preferred platform to continue commercial activities.For instance, in addition to established online platforms such as PickMe coordinating their delivery services through their mobile apps, many major supermarkets and other vendors have also started connecting to customers directly via platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook.Similarly, social media based Micro, Small, and Medium Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) have also attempted to restart their service provision, amidst several limitations. This blog discusses the impact of crises on social media based MSMEs in Sri Lanka.Coping with policy inconsistency and external shocks Over the past two years, social media based MSMEs in Sri Lanka have had to cope with different types of external shocks, which have posed both opportunities and challenges. Social media bans, for instance, pose a direct threat to companies that rely exclusively on social media to run operations. During a scoping study conducted by IPS last year, 83% of social media based businesses surveyed reported a negative impact on their operations during social media blockades imposed following the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks and the subsequent violence. Of those who reported a negative impact, more than half reported a reduction of 40%-100% in sales. The pandemic is further evidence of the vulnerability of small businesses – irrespective of whether they rely on traditional or online sales - around the world. Firms operating at this scale are often dependent on daily business activities, since margins are usually thin and cash reserves are limited. In light of social distancing measures and curfews curtailing service provision, social media based MSMEs are one group, among others, which are affected. In Sri Lanka, a majority of such companies (60% of the surveyed companies) operate in the informal sector and are not registered with the Registrar of Companies.  However, for some social media based MSMEs – particularly those operating in the food industry - the unprecedented rise in demand for home-deliveries during the curfew period, is an economic opportunity.Particularly, home bakers and food caterers who were already operating from home, via social media, and are already using established delivery systems, have a distinct advantage over MSMEs that were only relying on traditional sales platforms.This has also meant that these companies must strategically alter business operations to meet higher than average volumes of demand. However, even among social media based businesses in the food industry, those that rely on take-away and pick-up are likely to suffer, given that customers are unable to access these options during lockdown.However, with these benefits, a host of new challenges have emerged for social media based MSMEs, during this pandemic. For instance, due to recent actions of a few online competitors, overcharging for goods has come to be seen by consumers as a new concern in the online sales-space.Such issues have increased the urgency to formulate a policy framework that governs social media based business transactions. For instance, the absence of a legal framework that protects the interests of consumers and producers for dispute resolution was cited as problematic by those surveyed, even before the pandemic. Only 27% of surveyed respondents believed that the current policy framework in Sri Lanka is supportive of small online based businesses. Cashless transactionsPrior to the crisis, the most popular payment methods for social media based MSMEs were direct bank transfers (100%) and cash-on-delivery for payments (80%). Meanwhile, among MSMEs, online payments using debit/credit cards are significantly low (17%) due to the high cost of payment gateways. Notably, under the current curfew measures, however, access to cash has been limited, since the public is unable to access banks and ATMs, unless provided with mobile ATM access. Therefore, reduced access to cash among consumers would consequently drive down business for these MSMEs.The current crisis has also highlighted the low level of online banking usage within the Sri Lankan economy.Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s statistics of  online payments, as well as information provided through recent annual reports of several banks in Sri Lanka, suggest that less than 15% of the country’s banking customer base has access to online banking facilities.This number falls even further when considering online banking activity. As such, the ability for consumers who usually depend on cash-on-delivery to migrate to direct bank transfers is somewhat limited, affecting demand for social media based MSME produced goods and services even further.Currently, many banks have attempted to promote their e-banking services, and it would be in the best interests of the economy to continue the momentum towards encouraging such platforms even once the situation normalises.Beyond the current crisis, as Sri Lanka steps into a phase of development where digitalisation of services is being prioritised (government services, doing business procedures), the role that social media platforms play as enablers of business activity should not be underestimated.Particularly for segments such as MSMEs and youth, social media platforms are increasingly becoming the primary engagement platform for business activities,including advertising, selling, and delivery.Amidst the high potential for growth, however, several structural and policy mechanisms appear to be inhibiting the growth of these businesses. The current crisis may potentially create much needed impetus for the Sri Lankan economy to embrace e-commerce platforms, especially through social media.Even though at times many companies struggled to cope with the rapid increase in demand for services, they have since set up systems to engage in higher rates of e-commerce.In a post-COVID-19 economic order, having experienced its convenience, it is likely that demand continues for companies to introduce and upgrade e-commerce tools. A broader improvement in the e-commerce ecosystem in the country, therefore, would consequently result in long term benefits to expand choice and coverage of social media based businesses as well.Kithmina Hewage is a Research Economist and Harini Weerasekera is a Research Officer at the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka."
15 August 2021,Start-up MSMEs: “52%  fail to sustain beyond four years”,"Assistant General Manager, Branch Credit at Seylan Bank, Ranil Dissanayake spoke to Sunday Observer Business on the Bank’s strategic approach to strengthen and uplift the severely hit SME and MSME sector and the success of the relief measures presented by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.Excerpts:Q: As a bank that is focused more on small and medium business, can you tell us what the overall situation of the industry is at present?A: Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a pivotal role in any economy and the same is true for Sri Lanka.SMEs are the backbone of the economy that fuels economic growth, creates new job opportunities, and alleviates poverty.In fact, if you look at the big corporates, most of them started as a SME and grew to the level they are today.SMEs were the largest sector to be adversely impacted by Covid-19. It is a mixed environment that we are facing right now with SMEs, the biggest challenge is the impact from the on-going pandemic where most find it difficult to continue operations, manage supply chains, and cash flows, among others amidst the lockdowns and travel restrictions.SMEs benefit a lot from the current low interest rate regime to secure investments for expansions, and new developments as well as financing working capital requirements at much reduced cost.On the flip side, the entities which deal in Foreign Currency and are exposed to foreign exchange transactions are heavily vulnerable in the current market conditions.Q: Statistically speaking, MSMEs are the largest segment of business in the country. However, how well off are they at an individual business level? Are they able to turn a profit?A: MSMEs account for over 90% of registered entities in Sri Lanka. This figure is significantly large compared to developed countries and it is a sign that we don’t have much numbers transiting to Corporate level. It is however saddening that most of the MSMEs don’t sustain long enough to be profitable. Approximately 52% of start-up MSMEs fail to sustain beyond four years. This is mainly due to lack of proper planning, not understanding market dynamics and changes, and mis-management. Many entrepreneurs misread revenue as profit and fail to manage funds properly. Some go for unhealthy long term investments and also divert from core business, with not enough return in the short run to sustain.We need to admit that some SMEs go out of business due to external shocks such as the pandemic, as they are less geared to absorb such situations given the weaker financing structures, vulnerability in business models and markets. It is quite evident that any entity which manages cash wisely has better chances of not only earning revenue but breaking-even and starting to turn a profit in a very short time span.Q: It is now over a year since the first lockdown was announced. Did the State do enough to protect MSMEs? Has the private banking sector been proactive on their behalf?A: To answer this, we need to first understand our country’s situation leading to the pandemic. The state of our economy could not support a sizeable bail-out package.Nevertheless, the effort taken by the Government to support the sector during this crisis should be commended.The financial relief package was implemented through the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, the island was hit by a third wave, and the Central Bank has already issued directions to facilitate concessions to the businesses and individuals adversely impacted by it. The banking sector played a commendable role during the crisis and continues to do so during the current situation. Q: How has Seylan Bank navigated these waters?A: It was a challenge to serve clients while ensuring seamless internal operations despite disruptions. Our staff put in extra effort in managing the hectic volumes of debt moratorium and working capital facilities. We also had the challenge of working according to a roster with minimal staff, due to the pandemic.Seylan staff stood up to the task and worked as a closely knit-unit tirelessly to see through not only the first wave, but also the second. Our staff in certain parts of the country delivered cash to the doorstep of customers despite the invisible threat; some others had even arranged delivery of essential items and medicines to customers. Even during the current wave, we continue seamless operations while ensuring the safety of our own staff.  Q: Given that the ‘new normal’ is here to stay, how will things change for SMEs, MSMEs and the informal business sectors?A: There are good things that came with the ‘new normal’. We started thinking more about cost management, sustainability and core values. MSMEs started using digital banking services with transaction ease and reduced cost.Covid taught all of us including MSMEs to stick to the fundamentals and the importance of proper planning and being agile.It is important to know one’s limits and play within the limits, and aspire for growth with well-planned strategies and models. It was again and again established that cash is the king, and that for any business to prosper and forge forward, proper cash management is the key.Q: Finally, is it strategic for businesses to remain small?  How would Seylan Bank facilitate the growth of these entities?A: Being small and remaining small is a choice. Going big is also a choice and would bring in big returns with corresponding challenges in terms of risk and cost. Some entrepreneurs go beyond their boundaries and challenge the status-quo.At Seylan, we take it as a privilege to be that financing partner for those who aspire to go big. We have enormous stories and examples in our 34-year history in this regard."

5 April 2020, Exports - Present and post  Covid 19 era and its challenges,"The National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) is in contact with its members and with the authorities to provide uninterrupted services within the export industry. The Chamber has embarked on three key initiatives to cope with the situation. Foreseeing the need for efficiency and speed, particularly in times of crisis, the NCE has been championing the digitizing process for Export Documentation attestation for the longest time. The NCE has been offering the Digital Attestation of Certificate of Origin (CO) and other export-related documents, as a service to its members for quite some time.The digital platform developed by the NCE has, since this situation arose, leveraged its technical capabilities to process wherever possible operations for the Export industry, particularly in terms of relevant documentation, on line.Where some of these operations have come to a critical point, and in some cases, even to a halt, due to social distancing.The NCE offers assistance to maintain the smooth operation of export companies via its Digital Platform.The NCE encourages its members and the exporter community to use the Digital Platform for export-related document attestation, where the staff of the NCE Secretariat is at hand to avail members of services needed.Digitising most of the export documentation means that exporters can ensure the safety of their staff members, save time, money as well as the environment, even in the long-run.The NCE has published a video and a document containing step-by-step guidelines of registering as a Digital CO customer and how to obtain a CO. we have encouraged our members to use this digitised platform to facilitate their operations, which we feel will be standard procedure into the immediate and near future, with developments being made to improve system efficiency and the span of  export related documentation. Import substitutionEver since the Sri Lankan Rupee began to slide in relation to the US Dollar, a few years ago, the NCE has been strongly advocating the importance of increasing value addition in terms of input for products and processes for the Export Industry, where at present it stands at below 30%, and to enhance import substitution.The NCE is working on exploring the options for import substitution, which has a dual effect on the country’s economy, where the outflow of foreign exchange will be limited or controlled, as a compensation to the reduced inflow of foreign exchange. This will ensure the continuity of export industries while supporting the government to secure employment levels of the country. While we feel that this measure would galvanize the scientific and manufacturing sectors of the Nation, to focus on continued Research and Development on quality locally sourced raw material,which in turn will insulate the export industry’s dependence on the variability and availability of imported inputs. Considering this effort, the NCE forged an MOU with the Institute of Nano Technology (SLINTEC) and plans to forge similar ties with other research institutions of the country with a view to link its members with the research and development community, to arrive at this objective. In the near term, where many international orders would be cancelled or postponed due to the prevailing shutdown of global markets; manufacturers and regulations, including BOI companies, may have to change to adapt themselves to cater to inward looking policies, making available such excess production to the local consumer, even as a temporary measure. This could we feel maintain the manufacturing industries’ cash flows and ensure the continuation of employment and other operational areas in the short term to meet their commitments as well as to sustain these enterprises.  Business re-engineeringThe Chamber sees this situation as a turning point in changing the way we do business. The NCE has encouraged its members to “think out of the box” and explore new areas and methods in carrying out their respective operations.  The NCE has a strategic partner in Messrs Ernst &Young to conduct webinars regarding exporting enterprises, restructure financing, business recovery strategies and revenue streams, while planning for the next year, with contingency planning and risk management, in light of the present Covid-19 situation as well as the post Covid-19 situation to form a robust and resilient export industry.In conclusion the Chamber is aware of the global market realities and is closely watching the strategies and Best Practices adopted by these markets particularly the steps they plan to take on their recovery process, which may be useful in steering the course of our export’s strategy in the near term. We are also keeping track of the global economy growth rates, and relevant economic indicators, which will have a direct impact on the demand and off take of our exports, particularly for the apparel industry. We see these challenges as business realities which we would have to face, both seen and unseen and build an environment of preparedness and opportunity in a market where the variables keep changing constantly.The writer is the Immediate Past President of the National Chamber of Exporters."
24 May 2020, Exploring post Covid-19 global opportunities  ,"Respected British tennis legend Jo Durie once said, “If you can defend-attack and take the initiative, then you become a more dangerous player.” The quote is very applicable for Sri Lanka’s post covid-19 business efforts.We have successfully defended the pandemic and already initiated a counter attack by opening the country. All the necessary initiatives were taken by the President and the Government to face the challenges ahead pertaining to health and economic issues. The Government, under a solid leadership along with the unconditional backing of the entire state machinery, has so far managed the episode far better than most of the countries.    Covid-19 is seems to be here to stay for long and affect the world deeper than probably we are prepared to accept. With the current staggering confirmed cases and deaths around the world, the outbreak seems to have gone a long way beyond the initial expectations.We have not yet seen a hero with a vaccine or medicine to save the day. The Coronavirus has become the most discussed topic in the world today dominating every print, electronic and social media. Global media barely speaks about anything else other than the virus, no matter how important it is.  Many things are being said about the losses, business failures, mass scale economic shocks, social friction and many more on the subject.  In this backdrop, regardless of individual economic philosophy, continuous collaboration between individuals, the public, the private sector and the private sector must be encouraged and nurtured to come out as winners. As of now, domestic micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) suffer due to lack of revenue resulting in the inability to pay wages and also unable to find even day-to-day running expenses. The most affected are micro level businesses where operations are conducted with daily earnings. Now that panic shopping is over, even sales of essentials are also declining, making matters worse.Therefore, the initiatives taken by the Government have to be put into action before the situation worsens for these affected business entities.  It is good to see that despite the setbacks, Sri Lankan entrepreneurs are coming out to seek the post pandemic opportunities available. The only drawback is that while large scale operators are active, the small and medium sector does not seem to be displaying much enthusiasm.ReluctantIn this context, the Government has to engage and draw them out with a proper back-up campaign.My discussions with a few of them revealed that they are reluctant to come out as the banks are still not adequately supporting them for finances. They say that the banks are asking them for too much paperwork even to consider a loan under the SME scheme.      We have to look at the new business opportunities available for the business fraternity, SME sector in particular, which makes the larger contribution to the economy, both in money and in providing employment. It is a certainty that the current crisis will change long-term social interactions,  gatherings, and any other social involvements. Soon after the curfew was relaxed, we witnessed the public trying to adjust to the new normal. With time, this behaviour will require different products and services so far as business operations are concerned. New markets will emerge and new methods of marketing strategies will develop over time. Smart entrepreneurs understand this new consumer behaviour and adjust their products or services to meet future demands. They will grab the opportunity and adopt hands-on tactics to present their products.  In the global arena, new markets will open for many products and services. Therefore, this may be the opportunity for Sri Lankan companies to capture and capitalise on with new innovations, possibly with lower prices. Sri Lanka has a reputation for quality in export products whether it is tea, rubber, coconut, apparel, spices or any other export product. We also have maintained high standards in information technology related services with many reputed international companies operating in the country.  Foreign currency reserves are crucial at this point in time more than ever before. Countries are taking steps to curtail the outflow of their own money. However, the vast majority of the nations, except for a few, are compelled to import some products. This is common to Sri Lanka as well. The authorities have taken a long hard look and started devising plans to capitalise on this golden opportunity for our Export sector.  Sri Lanka is certain to find markets for Sri Lanka’s key export products such as apparel, tea, rubber, coconut, spices, gems, fruits and vegetables and so forth.Value additionHowever, the fact remains that Sri Lanka exports many of these categories in bulk form. It is time to focus on segregation and value addition as the point of difference with the competing countries. Even though the Sri Lanka export products contain high quality by itself, currently most of the medium level exporters concentrate on quantity more than the quality. This approach will have to be changed soon to take on the international competition.  However, some of the major players already have identified the market conditions, especially in sectors such as apparel and tea, and entered into value addition.Taking the urgency and the dire need of foreign reserves into consideration, the Government has engaged itself in promoting as much as value added products.The President must be commended in this regard for his clear instructions to the task force on economic revival to support the export trade. He has prudently appointed elite business leaders with hands-on experience to the task force, covering almost all related key areas.The practice thus far by consecutive Governments was to appoint political henchmen as favours to these important committees. It is the first time the country witnesses such a competent, credible and pertinent panel managing important economic activities. The business fraternity expects the task force to devise business friendly regulations, cut down red tape menace as much as possible and provide supporting mechanisms to encourage the industry. Already many large, small and medium sized entrepreneurs have expressed their willingness to join the effort by developing existing business whilst others to start new ventures in export trade. The calamity presents an extraordinary and unprecedented opportunity to Sri Lanka in terms of international business. The private sector understands this and is willing to get ahead. If this opportunity is taken positively by the Government agencies and act efficiently and effectively to promote the country’s export products and services, it will take a comparatively short period to succeed. The crisis offers an opportunity to both corporate and SMEs to reposition their products and services relevant to new consumer demands. "
10 May 2021,Breeding leaders - Reflections in retrospect – Part 1,"I thought of sharing, in two parts, an interesting dialogue that took place between my colleague, Tharindu Amarasekara and myself  on leadership. It was pertinent for me as I relinquished my duties as the PIM director last Friday, having completed two, three-year consecutive terms. This is part 1. Overview While critical reviews and solo interviews are much of the norm in modern business publications, the BMD facilitates a dialogue between two management thinkers from the leading MBA provider in Sri Lanka, PIM (Postgraduate Institute of Management).While one is a PIM veteran with over 15 years of service at PIM and a knowledge creator in leadership thinking and believes in being a lifelong Learner who can be further described as an international conference speaker, sought-after corporate trainer, veteran strategy consultant, prolific author and an acclaimed academic, the other is a fresh face to the PIM carder having honed his skills in the diverse fields of digital disruption, finance, and communication skills.The BMD facilitated a dialogue between Director, PIM, Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri  and Senior Lecturer at PIM, Tharindu Ameresekere, reflecting on the journey of PIM under the leadership of Prof. Dharmasiri and vital leadership lessons.   Tharindu: Professor, they say all good things must come to an end. As your term as Director of PIM comes to a close, what do you recollect as your experience?Prof. Ajantha: Tharindu, my association with PIM spans over 20 years, as a student, visiting faculty, core faculty, senior lecturer, professor and now the director and the chairman of the board of management. I got the surprised challenge as an Acting Director, at a time where I had not even applied for it. I decided to be an “active” director.Titles mean nothing unless those on whom it is bestowed act with purpose. After six months of proving my performance and my commitment, I was appointed as director of this prestigious institution which I consider to be a privilege and an honour. In fact, I was the youngest director of the largest postgraduate institute in Sri Lanka. I had a clear shift with regards to approaching people. I said, “No more individual super star” at the helm but a “galaxy of super stars” in harmonious action. It was team orientation in focus. I told my team, “my success is our success, my failure is our failure”. They responded whole-heartedly. Tharindu: Why is it important for an academic institution to have a strategic plan? One might say that an institution is there to teach and that is its business and purpose. But you implemented what is taught at this institution?Prof. Ajantha: Yes, Tharindu. We must practice what we preach. PIM’s approach has always been strategic. Strategy formulation and implementation is the sure way forward in achieving sustained results. PIM’s forward path is shaped by its current strategic plan. It was a time of intense competition as higher education institutions; MBA providers were sprouting. While there is a plethora of reasonably high quality, MBA and other master’s programs offered, PIM had to Reinvent, Reinforce and Redefine its role in the country as the Nation’s School of Business, as PIM was traditionally known.With the NIBM and NSBM in vibrant action, we needed to do something differently. We elevate ourselves as the “Nation’s Management Mentor”.We collectively built a strategy for PIM. A renewed focus, where among a sea of people chasing to have a MBA, we would produce those who can be an MBA. I coined the new motto. “Do not do an MBA; be brilliant as an MBA”. The significant shift from “doing” to “being” was of high strategic importance. I collectively strived to maintain the highest standards in the MBA with the right blend of context, content, and conduct. I was inspired by an interesting and insightful thought sharing on the future of MBAs. “From Higher Aims to Higher Hands” is the title of the treatise of Dr. Rakesh Khurana of Harvard Business School.His criticism of Harvard MBA as a “uni-polar” MBA as opposed to being a “multi-polar” MBA is worth reflecting. According to Khurana, a “uni-polar” MBA trains manager to have lucrative carriers in multinationals and large conglomerates. Instead, a “multi-polar” MBA should prepare the candidates in becoming entrepreneurs, setting up SMEs in fostering innovation and partnerships in offering best-cost solutions.It gave me a sense of satisfaction, as the MBA we offer has the scenario of making one out of five of its recipient’s entrepreneurs. In fact, we want to make this ratio doubled through the initiatives of PIM Genesis, our Business Incubation Centre.  I have been enriching my mind with contemporary thoughts on MBAs and postgraduate studies on Management, to explore new vistas in a true strategic sense. Recent comments by Elon Musk of Tesla fame, on MBAs lacking creativity also is a clarion call for regular review and continuous improvement. Tharindu: If you could describe your strategic approach that led to significant success. I am sure you have much more to share. Prof. Ajantha: Yes, of course. It began with the PIM’s Vision, Mission and values followed by goals and objectives and Key Performance Indicators for the said period.  All stakeholders are considered in the buildup of this strategic plan and we continue to monitor the environmental changes in the education sectors, local and global economies to ensure that we are aligned with the macro environmental forces.This way we ensure the graduates we produce are those who can make a difference in the world out there and contribute more to the Sri Lankan economy.If not, we will be just a teaching centre, but Tharindu, if we are to be the nation’s management mentor, we need to proceed with a plan. I was instrumental in collectively developing our vision which is to become a centre for management excellence in South Asia. Our mission goes as follows: “We ignite human imagination by developing leaders with global presence and local pulse. In this endeavour, we pursue innovative teaching, cutting-edge research, enriching partnerships, inspiring sustainability and exemplary governance.”We at PIM practice three key values, viz. Passion (Enthusiasm and eagerness towards results in showing professionalism), Integrity (Acting in an ethical manner with the best interest of the institution in mind) and Mindfulness (Paying attention to purpose and actions in doing things with self-awareness). As I envisaged, our “Edifice of Excellence” consists of five pillars, viz, Teaching, Research, Partnerships, Sustainability and Governance.My team and I enjoyed the fortune of not merely having this plan on paper but also putting into action mindful of how to maximise the benefits of this plan for our students and the wider management. I firmly believe that execution brings excellent results. It challenges us to move beyond multi-coloured, spiral bound strategy documents to dedicated action with key deliverables in mind. Tharindu: I have personally observed you are very team-oriented with a flair of relentless positivism. Why is this vital for a leader of an organisation?   Prof. Ajantha: Tharindu, this is very much in line with my life’s purpose. It goes as follows:I choose to be a radiator and a reflector of positive energy by way of exploring and sharing growth-fostering knowledge with humankind. This is because I have a genuine desire to use all the gifts that I have received from nature and nurture, unleashing the creativity in me with a global reach and a local touch. While doing so, I consistently maintain a balance between ongoing learning development, leadership growth and relationship richness.I consider myself as a “climate creator” where my community enjoy what they do in exerting themselves towards excellence. This goes very much in line with research related to Organisational Behaviour where it was found that happy people become far more productive.  I was inspired by a veteran CEO who said, I look after my people and they look after my business. Instead of treating my people as staff, subordinates, direct reports, or followers, I consider them as empowered leaders.That is what made it possible for me to travel overseas frequently to build study groups at over six overseas destinations. I never bothered to call PIM  on an hourly basis to check what is going on. For me, that is clearly micro-management. We cannot grow without proper delegation. I am so glad to reap the rich harvest of such leader-breeding. I recall with refreshing memories how we as a PIM community embarked on two overseas study tours. First to Kasetsart University in Thailand. Second to Gajah Mada University in Indonesia (with a stay in Singapore on the way back). These include all levels of employees from the director to the drivers, showing our solidarity. Each one was supposed to submit a write-up as to how the experience and observations helped them to do at least one new thing to improve PIM. The response was very positive. Way forward Part 2 of the article will highlight more insights into the pandemic. It will feature how the leading postgraduate entity responded to a planetary pandemic. "

4 October 2020,ASPI - Sri Lanka outperforms other countries in Sept,"The benchmark all share price index (ASPI) of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recorded significant gains outperforming all other main indexes around the globe during September. The ASPI gained12 percent in September and in value terms by Rs. 279.6 billion.The S&P SL20 index, which features the CSE’s 20 largest and most liquid stocks also gained in September by 4.39 percent closing at 2,463.27points on September 30. The average number of trades carried out in a trading day during September was 20,607, 96 percent higher than the year-to-date average number of trades done per day, a significant improvement in trading activity and investor engagement in September.In terms of market turnover, a Rs. 50 billion consolidated turnover was recorded in September. CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando said, “We are extremely happy that the local stock market has continued its upward trajectory since reopening on May 11, outperforming global giants. The continued low interest rate environment has led to more financial assets being moved from low yielding fixed income assets into the share market and we expect it to continue in the coming months.We have also witnessed much stronger confidence levels in the earnings growth of listed corporates as a result of the post Covid-19 bounce back and lower financing costs. Companies are being rewarded by investors who continue to expect strong earnings in the coming quarters.” "
7 February 2021,Getting started in shares - Part 1,"Thinking about investing? Investing in the stock market has always been an unfamiliar matter in the minds of those who hope to make an investment, mainly due to its volatile nature and the unfamiliar language that is widely associated with it. Potential investors seem to be quite overwhelmed and under prepared to invest in the stock market. This weekly space is dedicated to support those who wish to select the stock market as an investment.The Colombo Stock ExchangeThe Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is the nucleus of Sri Lanka’s capital market and is the licensed operator of the stock market. The CSE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) and was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in 1985. Today CSE provides an efficient and transparent market for trading, clearing and settling equity (shares) and debt instruments. While the core stakeholder base constitutes of 30 Members and Trading Members, 283 Listed companies, a base of 800,000+ local and foreign investors and other stakeholders. The CSE continues to make a considerable effort towards further development of the capital market which would pave the way for CSE to be categorized as the bench mark exchange in the region.What is a listed company? The Stock market provides the ideal platform for a company to tap into public funding. A listed company is one that has decided to use public funding to spur their next phase of expansion and done so with the approval of CSE. A company that has decided to use the capital market engine to fuel their growth could do so by issuing shares and/or debentures.Introduction to shares A share is simply a part of a company and the owner of a share is essentially an owner of the company. Purchasing a share through the CSE grants an investor with the opportunity to earn through either capital gains or dividends. In addition to this an investor is also entitled to a number of other benefits such as the right to vote at the general meeting. A company has the option to issue different types of shares, such as ordinary voting shares, non-voting shares and preference shares to name a few. Ordinary Voting Shares vs Non-Voting Ordinary Shares Ordinary shares are the most commonly issued type of equity security. A shareholder is offered both the voting rights at the company’s general meetings and is entitled to a portion of the dividends. While non-voting ordinary shareholders possess similar characteristics to an ordinary share except for the right to vote at a general meeting.In the event of a liquidation the payment to the voting shareholder would be considered last as they are the owners of the company and are entitled to what’s remaining after all other parties have been settled. While a non-voting shareholder would be compensated prior to a voting shareholder. Corporate debentures Investing in a corporate debenture is similar to lending money to the company which could be redeemed at a given future date.Investors are offered a predetermined fixed rate of interest or a floating rate of interest. As per the terms of the debenture issue an interest payment will be made on a specified date and is not bound by the profitability of the company. In order for a debenture to be listed on the Exchange it should have a minimum maturity period of two years. Secured vs Unsecured Debentures A debenture that is secured by some specific physical asset/s of the issuing company is a secured debenture while an unsecured debenture is where a debenture is not secured by a physical asset/s of the issuing company. - Courtesy: The Colombo Stock Exchange."

19 January 2020,Construction sector needs a well thought-out policy,"The construction industry is a major contributor to the Gross Domestic Product and a major driver of employment creation. A true development of the construction industry creates a multiplier effect in the national development process, owing to its forward and backward links.However, the domestic construction industry is now sluggish as a market and informal as an industry. Hence there is a need for a national policy on construction, envisioning a sustainable growth, based on a holistic approach. This essentially warrants consideration of all the issues encountered by the stakeholders.Such a policy must be aimed at creating an efficient construction industry able to effectively serve national development needs. This is basically through a proper streamlining of the entire supply chain, standardisation, capacity building, facilitation and research. What matters is a policy which will form an integral part of the economic policy that offers the national benchmark for strategic direction of the country’s development.At the outset, the policy must foster a culture of well-oriented sustainable construction. The first ever ‘bullet’ of prioritising public needs and utilities will help determine the scale of construction projects. We are a country with a building stock that is nearing obsolesce instead of demolition. Espousing adaptive building reuse will be the ideal step to deal with old buildings.Promoting research on sustainable construction materials, methods and processes is possible via a centrally coordinated arm of research covering the entire university network, for example. We too can encourage the use of traditional knowledge as much as possible. Giving priority to public hearing also helps harness the potential of tacit knowledge of construction. Public hearing could be considered as an integral part of feasibility studies in gauging various alternatives available.Meanwhile, encouraging the use of non irrigable lands for construction will be a step superlative. However, it is imperative to harmonise the allied policies, such as land use to ensure complementarity.Finding ways and means of inspiring the entire supply chain in selecting the construction materials and processes is also possible via the application of carbon accounting principles. Stimulating among the masses the adoption of environmentally favourable construction practices, such as deconstruction and recycling, for example, will too help minimise the release of building debris to the environment.Exploiting the market potential for solar energy is another way of looking at sustainability. In that sense, granting concessions for the private sector investment on solar energy, expanding the studies on green technology and promoting its application on all forms of domestic construction are a couple of giant steps a government can take a precedence in policy making.A giant step would be to assign in tender evaluation an equal weight on the most environmentally favourable offer as same as the least cost and technically feasible offer in public procurement. We too can easily introduce green building index and indices along with a national green specification applicable for construction.The government is able to emphasise the use of building resilient concepts and mainstream disaster risk reduction into construction practices, education and capacity building and establish a monitoring, evaluating and reporting system of the adherence of disaster resilient construction practices and structures.Sri Lanka has no building maintenance policy. In this respect, standards are inevitable and they must be based upon the criteria in the order of health and safety issues, statutory requirements and structural integrity of the entire building stock.On the other hand, a policy must be capable of strengthening the function of construction steering. Steering has several sub functions; both regulatory and promotional. Sri Lanka needs a Technology and Construction Court to trail out offenses, probe into matters of corruption, loss and deficiencies that result in loss of public money and render justice fairer and faster, all in relation to construction and technology disputes.As an industry, it requires codes of conduct, practices, procedures; processes and documentation updated enough to promote a good culture on its own. This essentially warrants a comprehensive revisit of all kinds of construction related standard specifications and guidelines, update them for current and future use. Standards can be easily readable only when they are published in simplified versions for site level application. We do not have specifications on a provincial basis, however.Relating to professional services, we do not find a service minute for many important professional disciplines, such as quantity surveying, technical auditing, forensic delay analysis and so on. A service minute is important to obtain and ensure that the public projects yield the best value for money.Technical auditing helps initiate investigations and curbs all kinds of technically corrupt means. Registration is yet another function of steering. Extending a scheme of registration in order to encompass the entire supply chain and monitor all personnel and entities is indeed imperative. Regarding dispute resolution, it is vital to streamline the education of alternative dispute resolution in construction and stipulate a law regarding construction adjudication. Bringing a new law on construction decennial liability will also be a leap forward in the legal arena.Construction is a field that circulates a colossal sum of money. A national construction fund would be collateral for obtaining bank facilities and as a hedge against construction deficiencies. On the other hand, contractors suffer from delay in payments and as a result, they quite often experience severe cash flow constraints and some go bankrupt with no solution behind.Therefore, honouring payments within at least 45 days must be part of the law that will eventually help ensure uninterrupted progress at site and ease out cash flow problems. From the employers’ perspective, obtaining planning approval has become a difficult task, which in due course, finds them drop out their thoughts on investments.In that sense, coordinating all construction planning and scheduling activities via a centrally coordinated arm of planning would serve the purpose of timely starting of projects.Participation of all those who have a stake, financially or otherwise, is important in a public project not only in policy making but also in policy amendments from time to time.The government should, envisage a positive and influential contribution from all the stakeholders in framing out and amending any policy, standard, protocol and guideline related to construction.On the other hand, loss in projects has been topical for a long time. The government has to entail a policy that recognises that any loss with regard to any existing project shall be determined by virtue of the contract the parties have entered into, while giving precedence to laws of the country that protect public rights.Such a policy must recognise state intervention in any controversy on the basis of a political and scientific reasoning.Also, it is time the government intervenes in removing all forms of unauthorised construction and avoiding re-congestion into slumps. This is possible via alternative means of human settlement.The government should discourage the use of unsolicited bidding in public procurement except where no other accepted means is possible due to the scientific nature of the project.Sri Lanka is notorious for the high cost of construction. This is predominately because of imported materials and high labour cost.Revisiting the tax structure and especially the existing cess system would ease out this situation. Since the economy is liberal to a greater extent where the private sector is free enough to invest and make money, it is important we establish a fairly sustainable mechanism to attract investment in infrastructure via private sector and foreign direct investment.A proper tax incidence would only help this out. From the public perspective, declaring records of construction auditing and making them public domain can be a giant step. However, the public has no access to a directory of construction tradesmen, niche markets, local and foreign. Establishment of an industry-wide statistical database with information on resources, projects, industry players and linkages to related industries and sectors would also help the public in saving money.This essentially warrants a systematic dissemination and publication of information relating to the construction industry and its development. The human capital must receive prominence in any policy. Using the human capital involved in the entire construction supply chain effectively is indeed imperative.There is no centrally coordinated national pool of construction tradesmen, either. For tradesmen, it is important to introduce a central insurance scheme and provide a retirement scheme. Evaluating performance and annual appraisals, emphasising public accountability in all dealings, facilitating on-the-job training for apprenticeship and partnering arrangements will help expand this pool of skilled workers.Introducing ethics for construction tradesmen and enhancing and monitoring the application of occupational safety and health standards and practices too will help inculcate a culture that is optimistic for a sustainable construction industry.- The writer is attached to the University of Vocational Technology"
7 March 2021,Laxapana Batteries to invest Rs 1.1 b in solar energy projects,"Laxapana Batteries PLC is entering the renewable energy business. Having evaluated prospects in this space, the company plans to invest over Rs. 1 billion in generating renewable energy from rooftop solar projects.To fund the investment, the company proposes raising Rs. 540 m through a Rights Issue and also plans to lock-in in long-term debt to benefit from the prevailing low-interest rate regime. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held on February 10, the shareholders of Laxapana Batteries approved the Rights Issue to offer 36,000,000 ordinary shares, which is in the proportion of 12 new ordinary shares for every 13 existing ordinary shares held at Rs 15 per share.With a Rs. 1.1 bn investment to develop rooftop solar projects, Laxapana is well positioned with a sustainable business model to contribute towards the government’s policy of increasing the share of renewable energy production.Laxapana has delivered a resilient performance in the FY2020/21 period. The Company recorded growth in Q3 FY2020/21 with a revenue increase by 14%, over Q3 FY2019/20 and profit before tax growing by Rs. 29.4 mn. It recorded a revenue of Rs. 206.2 mn and Rs. 552.7 mn in Q3 FY2020/21 and nine months ended December 31, 2020.These compare to Rs. 180.4 mn and Rs. 506.2 mn to corresponding periods in FY2019/20. Cumulative profit before tax of Rs. 100.4 mn for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 is a notable year-on-year increase of 113% over Rs. 47.2 mn recorded last year nine months despite numerous challenges encountered in the business environment.The new investment initiative further diversifies the company’s business portfolio and is expected to contribute positively to earnings going forward.The management believes that revenues from its trading businesses will continue to remain strong with Laxapana branded products experiencing strong market demand. With this in mind, the present trend of improving profitability is expected to continue."
18 July 2021,CCC supports startups to attract Investments,"In line with the recently concluded Sri Lanka Investment Forum (SLIF) 2021 organised by the BOI, the Council for Startups (CFS) of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) and the Colombo Stock Exchange held a webinar on the Startup Ecosystem Landscape to attract investments via the local Tech and Innovation opportunities.The aim of the webinar was to showcase the local tech and innovation potential and to boost the venture funding ecosystem in Sri Lanka. The panelist included  Managing Director, Sequoia Capital, Rajan Anandan; Director and Group CEO, Dialog Axiata PLC, Supun Weerasinghe;  Chairman, Asia Securities, Dumith Fernando. Chairman, Council for Startups of The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Prajeeth Balasubramaniam moderated the session. Over the past 10 years Sri Lankaon average has had venture funding of approximately $2.5m per year where leading countries spend close to 0.5% of GDP per annum. This equates to $400M per annum in Venture Funding for Sri Lanka. Thus the objective during the session was to see how Sri Lankacould gradually increase this funding by at least targeting 0.1% of GDP ($80M) for 2022-2023by highlighting the following:Geopolitical location - Connected with over eight trillion GDP within five-hour flying time which makes it easier for startups to scale.Untapped market – Still at an early stage with only approximately 400 startups, thus becoming attractive compared to the region for investors that are early movers. Tech talent – Small in numbers but proven talent that can build world class products to compete globally.Brain gain - Sri Lanka has been ranked second best for digital nomads in 2021 ahead of Singapore by Club Med. This study by the French travel company looked at cost of living, safety, average internet speed, presence of nature and wellness spots, as well as adventurous activities in each country. There is plenty of young Lankan talent returning to the country and many successful startups in Sri Lanka were founded by them. These entrepreneurs studied in the best schools globally, worked for a few years and came back. They have a worldview but want to be in Lanka.Govt incentives and support – Tax breaks, infrastructure development focused on ICT exports, Digital ID cards, Internet for every citizen.Untapped innovation potential in the last mile, Fin-Tech, Ed-tech, Health-tech, and Agri-tech and startups are able to become profitable fast in a smaller test market. It was also noted that many startups have not grown and/or have shut down due to lack of funding.Therefore, a mechanism of increasing the depth and breath of the investor pool to boost this ecosystem should be looked at. With the increased focus of the government, this new asset class can become vibrant like in other countries, increasing new employment opportunities and FDI.The discussion stressed the need to increase the funding and to create a friendly environment for the startups. The panel highlighted the need for startup business incubator providers in Sri Lanka to be more comprehensive and support startups holistically. The panelists pointed out the importance of a proper entrepreneurial education system to transform Sri Lanka into a world class technology and innovation hub.B2B meetings were organised to support the Sri Lankan Startups to reach out to international investors and showcase their product or service offerings and secure investments.The Council for Startups of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce called in applications and showcased the selected startups based on the merit of their offerings to address the world problems which also had high growth potential.The Startups selected to exhibit their offerings classified by the sector were:Agriculture: SpectrifyAI, and Agrithmics, Education: Headstart, and CrowdLearn, Financial Services: Niftron, DirectPay, Thyāga E-gift Vouchers, and InsureMe, Food and Beverage: Isso Restaurants, Sozo Beverages, and OMAK Technologies, Healthcare: oDoc, Logistics: Layer 7 Innovations, and Gensoft, Marketing and Advertising: ReapDigital, and Roar Global, Retail: Stripes & Checks, and Zigzag.  The CFS-Exhibitor virtual lounge was designed to connect these startups with potential investors and it successfully connected 12 B2B meetings with investors from several countries. The feedback from the investors and startups were very positive. "
7 July 2019,CSE holds investor forum in Jaffna,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in association with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) organised an investor forum in Jaffna recently.It was the 17th of the Regional Investor Forum Series organised around the country.The forum attracted over 180 participants, including a number of present and active market investors.

24 January 2021,Employ quality people to exceed targets,"Quality is defined as, “The standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind”; “The degree of excellence of something”; “A distinctive attribute or characteristic possessed by someone or something.”With the prevalence of Covid-19 and its adverse impact on many areas particular to business, sales and marketing, income, revenue, finance and economy, most companies are compelled to downsize customers and employees including the sales force, impose pay cuts and halt the implementation of plans and activities.This may seem as the best option in today’s context. However, keeping in mind your “ultimate goal” this may perhaps not be the right decision.As an entrepreneur you need to identify the “root cause of the problem” for the company’s underperformance and underlying factors for the crises that you and your company now face. Low sales and performances are only the tip of the iceberg. You need to diagnose the real problem to find solutions.Along with the other elements in the marketing mix, you need to focus on quality people.If you have mediocre sales and marketing representatives, they will definitely produce mediocre results.They will even disturb or delay your processes. When they are in the field for each and every problem whether small or big they will call you frequently to sort out the problem. They would always be, “part of the problem”.Selfish peopleThis is mainly due to the fact those representatives have a, “Thus far, no further” attitude. They are selfish people who think only about their personal benefits, goals and objectives. They waste company resources and are liabilities to the company.If you want revenue and profits you should always have quality people in the superachievers or the elite club category.This category of people would have the attitude of “Going that extra mile”. They will think and act independently and take timely decisions with your consent to benefit the organisation. This type of people are always, “Part of the solution”. These people are the “assets” of the company and the income, profit and wealth generators of the organisation. When you pick the right person, the business and the organisation will move in the right direction.Who is responsible for quality?Everyone is responsible for quality. When you visit some organisations you get dissatisfied or are disappointed with the reception you get from the security guard at the entrance or sometimes the way the receptionists treat you. In certain cases you get dissatisfied before visiting the service provider’s office.This happens when you try to call the officer whom you need to contact but get unpleasant service from the receptionist.In other cases the officer whom you meet to seek for his services may not provide quality service. This may be due to lack of knowledge or lackadaisical attitude.This type of staff member may spoil the image and the business of the company. Hence, you need to start training from the security officers upto the managers on how to have the correct attitude and provide the best service at all times.Some companies as soon as they hire a sales representative or marketing officer give them the product literature or catalogues and request them to memorise the contents and detail it to customers.Minimal time is spent on training and the newcomers are accompanied by the seniors and are asked to observe a few presentations and the newcomers are compelled to detail on their own.This type of representative will aggravate the situation and definitely halt the progress of the company due the rejections of the fresher and his or her products and the company.To succeed in today’s business world you need to select the ideal sales and marketing representatives and provide “comprehensive training” and ensure they are “very competent” and “competitive” before their field visits to meet customers.The sales representatives or sales officers and marketing representatives should have the knowledge and skills to successfully carry out their duties and meet or exceed the company targets on quality, sales, growth, efficiency, performances and productivity.The important “knowledge” areas for sales and marketing personnel are: Company, market and industry, product, technical, territory, sales and marketing, company policies and procedures, customer and competitor knowledge.SkillsAmong the skills needed for a sales or marketing representatives are: Professional communication or skilled communication (which includes, opening, creating interest, presentation, questioning techniques, active listening, providing a balanced perspective, paraphrasing and summarising, objections and rejections handling and closing skills), rapport- building skills, prospecting, network marketing, precise time management, prioritation, organisational problem solving, customer relationship management systems, digital marketing, technological, information gathering, collaboration, negotiation, product demonstration, being persuasive, interpersonal skills, teamwork, critical thinking and analytical skills, computer literate, change management, crisis and conflict management, group communication and leadership skills. In the past most of these skills were needed only by the managers.To succeed in the ever-changing business environment, you should make your sales and marketing representatives familiar with these important knowledge and skills to make them meet or exceed the company’s qualitative and quantitative goals and objectives.This will fundamentally make them more self-confident.Hence this will make them perform even better. What is important here is that you should make them perform consistently. To achieve this, you must inculcate the “winning attitude” in your employees.At the outset, the company’s vision and mission statements along with the goals and objectives should be advocated to the new employees.They should be made to believe in themselves, the management and the company, besides all the outlined knowledge that they have gathered. Professionalism and strong work ethic should be regarded by them as their eyes.Make them have “continuous sales and marketing education.” Make them realise that, razor sharp focus, relentless hard work and commitment to the work at hand are the contributing factors for greater conquests.With this type of inspiration they will be geared to meet the “World of Challenges and Opportunities” and make your company and products or services No.1, thus exceeding the expectations of the company as they would know how to generate revenue and profits in spite of changes, crises or conflicts that may arise when marching towards business success.Then perhaps, they could fly high in the business world like eagles. It is upto you to decide whether you want parrots or eagles in your company. During my inspirational lectures I used to ask a simple question from participants as to how much they should contribute towards the company’s success and how much to expect in return.Most of them used to say 50:50. In other words give or contribute 50 percent to the company and seek 50 percent from the company. Some of the participants used to say 60:40. None of that is the correct answer as they are under-expectation and under-performance. The ratio of 100:100 is the correct answer.Do not compromise on quality. Always focus on quality. Quantity will follow sooner rather than later. Invest in the right people. Downsizing may not be always the best option.The New Year has dawned. Think about the new year resolutions that you have made.With everything falling in its place, “Growing growth” is the order of the day. Should you be interested in seeing “new horizons” in your business, it is the time for “expansion” of your business.Are you willing to take up this challenge? Do you believe in yourself and your people so that they could improve and add value to your organisation. Everything is up to you. You could decide now as you are the best judge. Quality attracts quality. Quality is everything and everything is quality. Their competency will win the game for you.The writer is a specialist in professional communication skills, sales and marketing, training and a business consultant with 30 years experience."
7 June 2020,Disrupive lean strategies to create a new normal,"The Covid-19 pandemic is reshaping the global business environment with the UN anticipating that the crisis will result in a $8.5 trillion hit to the world economy in 2020 (UN, DESA, May 2020).Coronavirus has a long incubation period to spurt the infection. Similarly, a vital question is being brewed in the minds of people; whether our leaders have a clear vision for the post-crisis in the future. It is obvious that leaders need to address the questions convincingly. However, the business environment that would lead to end in two years may be very different from what it was before the crisis.Exploiting the novel opportunities created by Covid-19 is more important than formulating plans to overcome the worst conditions that have emerged due to the crisis. The outbreak demands us to research into business processes relating to health of the people and the wealth of business organisations. A slogan of preparing an organisation for the worst in advance and hope for the best would be a better disruptive strategy to create a more productive and a lean business organisation. Whether in times of crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic or in times of relative stability, leading with a vision and articulating a strategic path forward is crucial for long-term business success (Mark W Johnson, JohSuskewicz, HBR, April 2020).It is the thinking of management gurus that any form of crisis creates a conducive environment in organisations to make changes. This crisis forces all leaders to eliminate all types of wastes that were hidden in the deep-rooted traditional business processes. The time has come to challenge all these processes and to make them lean if organisations are to survive in the future. It is a fact that most business organisations have been overmanaged and overstaffed before the crisis. Some of organisational structures were complicated. Today Covid -19 has created a new normalcy: emerging of new lean value chains that are challenging the current traditional costly businesses.All visionary leaders are bold, prophetic and at the same time pragmatic. They don’t just promote change, but drive it, while inspiring and mobilising the team to do the same. Larry Myler, founder and CEO of By Monday, Inc. has emphasised four ways of thinking on disruptive business strategies for organisations.Four thinking styles of disruptive strategiesDisruptive Strategy enables you to make innovation a reality. Disruption is about a better business model. A disruptive business model employs a strategy for creating new business markets by improving upon or making a change to a business model.• Be the Disrupter, not the Disruptee. The first-mover advantage is often a key to success when executing a disruptive strategy. Leaders should not wait for disruption to start nipping at the heals. Preparedness and futuristic thinking yield much more if the leader is ready to face the challenge. E.g. Most of the foreign universities were ready with Online Teaching Platforms (OTP) before Covid-19. So is the case with NIBM as well.• Self-Disruption is not Self-Destruction. The major obstacle to executing self-disruptive strategies is the concern of successful organisations that their efforts will annihilate/ devastate their current success. They fear profits may decrease and they could disappoint stakeholders. This short-term view has been the downfall of many an organisation that, ironically, has ended up being disrupted by competitors. Eg. In the Apple company, ipod sales came down due to the disruptive effects of the Smart Phone but later Smart Phone sales exceeded the ipod downturn.• Follow latest Technology of the Outside of the Industry. Chances are, that the technology that will revolutionise your industry in the future is already doing so in a completely unrelated industry today. E.g. Singapore Airline copied the speedy preventive maintenance system of formula Races with a few technicians for their aircraft maintenance service.• Read the real Pulse of Customers. They can be your early-warning system, allowing you to react in real time to market changes. Without customer guidance, you will most likely be creating products and services for a market that no longer exists. E.g. Lean supply chains of companies which were easily adopted to deliver goods and services at door steps of customers survived during Covid-19A Fast-track 5-point Lean Recipe/ strategy has been formulated to test the new business model being created by Covid-19 to make organisations lean. First, it is vital to develop lean thinking and the mindset among employees and other stakeholders, while supporting customers in the best possible way to create a new normal and a better world of work.A 5- points Fast-Track Lean Strategy (FTLS)Post Covid-19 demands industries and organisations to build lean behaviour without which survival of organisations and to earn a cutting edge over competitors are questionable. Fast adaptation to new normalcy by innovating new value chains and fast response to customers by being relevant with the support of a talented team of employees lead to make the stability and capability in organisations.Lean Strategy -01: New Agile Value ChainsAn agile value chain is a business process to create value quickly, whilst saving costs, being responsive to market demands, maintaining flexibility and keeping productivity high. Innovation can be in two forms: Product and Process Innovation.• Product innovation: It is about bringing in a change in the product. It can be in two different forms.First: is an improvement in the performance of a product. E.g. Hands-Free Door Openers, Robots have been modified to deliver medicines, meals and to collect bed sheets and rubbish in hospitals, the e-commerce giant JD developed a drone program to drop parcels and to spray disinfectant.Second: is new features in a product. E.g. Smart Helmet can identify anyone with fever within a five-meter radius. Retailers started to license Amazon's “Just walk-out” technology that combines computer vision and AI to bill customers directly as they walk out of the store, with no checkout required.• New Process InnovationProcess innovation is about improvement in the process of producing a product. It includes changes across all the value chain activities. e.g. Fashion Designers along with major clothing manufacturers like Gap, ZARA, and Hanes are converting their factories from producing clothes to making face masks for doctors and nurses. Companies like Amazon, Instacart, Lowes, and Walmart have announced plans to hire hundreds of thousands of new workers to increase their ability to deliver products and groceries to people at home. Most universities started online teaching as well.Product innovation is common and it is based on customers’ needs and wants but creates a new agile value chain or a process innovation that brings in a total change in the way of doing business. It attacks cost, lead time, quality and agility of manufacturing or the service delivery process.Lean Strategy -02: Fast-ResponsiveDigitalized CRM:All of us live in a society where everyone wants everything as soon as possible. The speed of doing things matters a lot in life and in most of the time, the winner is the first to surprise you. As the Covid-19 forces people into a digital-only way of life, it’s vital for businesses to infuse virtual experiences with a human touch. All relationships have an emotional component and that holds true for the connection between people and brands. Your business’s relationship with customers is built over time, nourished by experiences along many online and physical touch points in their journey, grounded in expectations, and confirmed through repeated interactions.The “locked down”, which is forcing most people to be physically separated from their friends, extended family, workplace, and favourite places, is requiring organisations to adapt to a digital or remote way of doing business and is dramatically altering people’s daily experiences.If you demonstrate to your customers that you’re doing everything in your power to protect and serve them ahead of seeking profits — that you understand that this is not the time for business as usual — they will be far more forgiving of imperfect execution, operational glitches, and poor video connections. Ultimately, Covid-19 will teach us a great deal about the true nature of interaction and collaboration: that they will lead to a deeper appreciation of putting people first, that brands will have had the opportunity to show their true colours (positively or negatively), and that companies, brands, workers, and consumers are capable of adapting in a positive way to a change, that is imposed upon all of us, and emerging, together, to a better place.• Empathy:Empathy refers to the quick adaptation and better communication to promote and share the views of the clientele with a real empathy and clear understanding of customer needs and making your organisation relevant to the needs and wants of the customers.• Service Continuity and Steadiness:This refers to creating or redesigning delivery channels to make them lean and meeting the expectations of the customers. It is vital to continue the service with the same good quality while respecting the requirements of the customers.• Put the customer FirstAt the end of the day, it’s all about putting the customer first. You can’t prioritise responsiveness if you aren’t consistently thinking about how different actions impact your ability to delight customers. Stop making excuses and start identifying solutions that will allow you to communicate with speed and accuracy. Putting your customers first before making profits and deeper appreciations of new situations are important perspectives of any brand to build the image in the minds of the people.• Win-win PartnershipsSupporting customers to bring them back to a normal life with a lean service package is a prime requirement to assure the long-term sustainability of business relationships.Lean Strategy -03: Lean HolacracyModel Structure:Covid-19 taught us and made clear that many business enterprises are overmanaged and overstaffed. It was evident that many organisations can run smoothly while the staff is resting at home. Organisations can be managed with a small team of tech-savvy people and the resultant cost would be extremely lower than the normal cost but with the same level of operations. Hence, Covid-19 forced us to rethink and to redesign the structure of the organisation with clearly defined new roles to be played by employees and the management. It is high time for CEOs to redesign their business models and value chains, so that more sustainable business environments could be created for the benefits of all stakeholders.Emma Giner is an organisational design expert who says the Holacracy model may hold the key to the future of the organisational structure (Emma Giner, EU Business School, April 2020). It reflects how Gen Z see themselves with a set of skills and their career as an experience, rather than as a direct path to a title and salary. Giner helpfully compared this paradigm to the way the film industry operates. A team comes together around a project and, once the project is completed, the team dissolves. Members of the team may come together again on another project but could take on different roles, much in the same way, an actor in one film might produce or direct another. Reflecting on this insight as well as the various organisational and economic models Giner has offered the following advice.• Ignore what is being said online about going ‘back to normal’ once this crisis is over. We don’t want to go back to where we were. Take this opportunity to create a new normal, a better world. If we go backwards, we may end up being back in traditional costly systems again.• Consider the DNA of the company and talent you’re creating or working with. Hierarchy won’t help to get the job done. Organisations need to be more human. Consider your mission and the people you work within the context of a question: what can you bring to the world?• Remember, the economy is planetary, it is no longer local. Everything we do and create has an impact on the people and the world around us. When starting a business or a project, make sure that the impact you’ll have is positive.• Younger generations have valuable ideas and feedback to offer the older, more experienced professionals. Senior co-workers benefit from the technical and digital understanding of younger employees and their ability to navigate our ever-changing world. Play an active role, voice your ideas and opinions because everything that’s being created now will be much more sustainable if we’re in it together.Lean Strategy -04: Capable Pool of HR with TDF TalentsMost employers would prefer a few employees in critical positions. These roles significantly impact your company’s revenue, growth and business plans. Thinkers, Doers and Finishers are critical, and they are capable if they possess all three talents in one. Capability is a combination of two critical competencies: ability and the capacity. Ability is a skill, either mental or physical; native or acquired while the capacity is the potential to develop a skill usually known as mental capacity. A person who can walk (ability) can run with the speed of 100 meters in eight seconds (Capacity). Capable pool of HR is a team of employees with the skills of thinking, doing and finishing any assigned task. Motivation is the driving force that pulls and energises employees to channel all their efforts in one direction. Hence, we need to create factors that drive employees to put their effort in to their work. Motivated people are industrious, creative, dependable and thoroughly in what they do.Generations Alpha and Z, the children of millennials, are the most racially diverse generations across the world, and one in which technology is simply an extension of their own consciousness and identity, with social media being a way of life. While generations at this point are possibly oblivious to the impact of the global pandemic on their education, the impact will surely be felt even for our youngest learners in years to come.In the midst of the Covid-19 crisis, we are sure that fellow educators, like us, are wondering what we need to be preparing our students for, in the future. According to a Dell Technologies report, 85 percent of the jobs in 2030 that Generation Z and Alpha will enter into, have not been invented yet (citation). According to this World Economic Forum report, 65 percent of primary-schoolchildren today will be working in job types that do not exist yet.• Flexy Hours and Co-workingThis refers to the workspaces of people, who perceive a workspace, as a way of connecting life and projects that unite them beyond their individual tasks. This is the key to the coworking spaces, and design is the key to create this atmosphere of well-being.Currently, trends are pointing towards the breakdown of boundaries between work, life and leisure spaces. New technologies allow us to work from anywhere and the shift towards creating hybrid environments, combining pleasure and work, is becoming even more popular every day. In this sense, we will soon be able to find offices combined with homes or shops and mixed-used buildings where the focus is on people.• Educating Employees and customers in an interconnected worldCovid-19 is a pandemic that illustrates how globally interconnected we are – there is no longer such a thing as isolated issues and actions. Successful people in the coming decades will need to be able to understand this interrelatedness and navigate across boundaries to leverage their differences and work in a globally collaborative way.• Redefining the Role of the Manager or EducatorThe notion of an educator (Sensei) as the knowledge-holder who imparts wisdom to their learners is no longer fit for the purpose of a 21st-century training and education. With learners being able to gain access to knowledge, and even learn a technical skill, through a few clicks on their phones, tablets and computers, we will need to redefine the role of the educator. This may mean that the role of educators will need to move towards facilitating young people’s development as contributing members of society.• Performance Based RewardsRewards can play an important role in motivating employees. The theory is that employees will be motivated to undertake a task, if they think a particular reward will be forthcoming.Lean Strategy -05: Disruptive TechnologyDisruptive technology is an innovation that significantly alters the way that consumers, industries, or businesses operate. Recent disruptive technology examples include e-commerce, online news sites, ride-sharing apps and GPS systems. A disruptive technology sweeps away the systems or habits it replaces, because it has attributes that are recognisably superior.In fact, a disruptive technology supersedes an older process, product, or habit. It usually has superior attributes that are immediately obvious, especially to early adopters. Upstarts rather than established companies are the usual sources of disruptive technologies.As traditional brick and mortar businesses suddenly can’t rely on foot traffic to fill their store fronts, now small businesses must focus on their online presence. We haven’t seen Google search traffic diminish too much since the Covid-19 outbreak, so all small businesses should take this time to improve their online web presence fast. As companies increase remote work policies and flexible workforce arrangements, IT systems and support will need to be aligned. The sudden increase in online activity can have big implications on system stability, network robustness and data security, especially in parts of the world where telecom and systems infrastructure are not well developed. Companies will need to act quickly to ensure they have the systems, and support staff, in place to ensure smooth operation as the workplace and workforce evolves.• E-commerce will experience a renaissanceDue to self-isolation, consumers who normally visit physical stores are increasingly shopping online with the result that e-commerce is booming. The uplift in e-commerce may well become permanent if people remain wary of mingling in real life, and increasingly replace shop visits with online purchases• Digital collaboration and entertainment tools to see an upsurge in valuationAs companies rapidly and also permanently move towards remote working, the market for digital collaboration tools such as Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts and Zoom are likely to grow quickly. Zoom has already experienced a 50 percent increase in its share price since the start of the year.• Unlocking technology to deliver training and educationThe Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in educational institutions across the world being compelled to suddenly harness and utilize the suite of available technological tools to create content for remote learning for employees in all sectors. Educators across the world are experiencing new possibilities to do things differently and with greater flexibility resulting in potential benefits in accessibility to education for people across the world. These are new modes of instruction that have previously been largely untapped. Most importantly, it is our hope that for Generation Z, Alpha and the generations to come, these experiences of isolation and remote learning away from their peers, teachers and classrooms will serve as a cautious reminder of the importance of our human need for face-to-face social interaction.Analysing business trends in the past and present and strategising future correctly with a vision would drive organisations to implement fast-track lean strategies to improve productivity and finally make organisations lean.  "
22 December 2019,"Mending the national psyche: Restoring military pride, the first order of business","It is peacetime, but the armed forces have had to recover from a fight in which this country was divided against itself. In the last five years our military men and women, the hunters that smoked out LTTE terror strongholds and halted the incessant terror bombings of civilians in the bargain, became the hunted.You read that right. The hunters became the hunted. This sudden attempt at delegitimization of the armed forces in the eyes of the people took many forms.The former government encouraged a cabal of its supporters to say that the armed forces were not war heroes. Rana viruvo me rate nathe — there are no heroes of war— warriors — in this country, said various part time hit men and moonlighting academic types who later morphed into hirsute folk who spoke about ranaviru gaaya. (‘Warrior sickness’.)This gut punch was aimed at anyone who had served in the tri forces or who was currently serving. Avant Garde, which used the expertise of ex military personnel to set up floating armories to fight sea piracy and regulate arms storage by those who were engaged in combating such sea piracy, was raided and company personnel jailed on trumped up charges. With that, the writing was thick on the wall …The process of the delegitimization of the armed forces peaked with the structural demobilization of the intelligence cadre of the military, which led to the general weakening of the security apparatus and had a negative effect on national security in general, enabling the Easter Sunday attacks.In other words, national security hit a nadir, because the armed forces had been thoroughly delegitimized and humiliated.The hunters were not only being hunted, they were being baton charged, laughed at and collectively made to look like society’s marginals, or unwanted brigands.What is unfortunate is that this kind of delegitimization, though it appears to have been haphazardly carried out, was in reality a planned effort to negatively disrupt the Sri Lankan nation, when the armed forces had become a symbol of national unity and national pride after the successful rout of the LTTE.Liminal stateThough Sri Lanka has successfully transitioned from a warring nation into a peaceful country with a civilian administration that had no overt reliance on military personnel, in many ways the armed forces were very much in a ‘liminal state’ in that right of passage.Anthropologists rely on the concept of liminality to describe an in-between stage in any right of passage. The Sri Lankan armed forces may have no fight on their hands any more with the LTTE vanquished.But though the fight was over, in the mass psyche the soldier boys and girls/men and women, were still warriors, they continued to be heroes, and they continued to fire the national imagination about the possibility of achieving certain ends against seemingly impossible odds, if only Sri Lankans agreed to put their mind to it …It was this unifying character of the armed forces that most annoyed all those who wanted to disrupt Sri Lanka negatively and attack the national psyche to suit their own ends. Many LTTE supporters hated the armed forces for defeating Prabhakaran’s armed campaign, but others who wanted to appease these LTTE cheer squads were aware that the armed forces served a greater purpose than merely being the nation’s fallback when there was an imminent security threat.The forces were a source of national pride. They were a unifying symbol in a society that was struggling to emerge from years of deprivation and struggle, and was finally coming into its own as a middle income economy that had some hope for its citizens. The liminal image of armed forces as the nation’s aggregated mascot plus good luck charm, was not accidental. It was necessary.How was the delegitimization of the armed forces achieved by those who wanted to do damage to this positive role that the military community took on in the upkeep of an upbeat, healthy national psyche?They started with building up a delegitimizing narrative that the armed forces were ghosts from the past that were needlessly scaring Sri Lanka’s minority communities. But the elements of the narrative went far deeper than that.They painted military youth as uncouth, mostly unwashed, and uneducated.This has been an old trope of course, with one ex Minister saying infamously that any ox can go to war, but that old trope was revived ...Festooned windowsAll ethics were thrown out the window, and in the mad rush to demonize and finally humiliate military men and women, we became the most ungrateful of nations, with disabled soldiers being forced to protest on the streets to get their just dues. Wheelchairs were met with water cannon, one wag observed.What’s important to take heed of, is that the ‘armed forces problem’ began in the minds of certain men.There was no armed forces problem, and on the contrary as in the Rakna Lanka and Avant Garde examples, armed forces personnel and others with previous armed forces experience and expertise, were useful members of society who often had ready solutions to some of society’s more pressing issues.As for the minorities, weren’t they protected by the armed forces as well?They were, especially during flood situations such as what took place in Mullathivu recently, and other natural calamities.Some very expressive pieces of photojournalism will tell you that.Though there are minority politicians who vilify the armed forces at the drop of a hat, their political motivations in doing so need no special repetition here. However, weren’t Tamil politicians quoted as saying they want more troops in the North, after the Easter Sunday attacks?Wars in their aftermath have this tendency of unifying and assimilating diverse groups. A joke doing the rounds during WW1 about the US Army, which was constituted of many new immigrants from far flung countries, went like this: When a staff sergeant called the roll on day one at Maryland’s Camp Meade, not a single man recognized his own name – but when the officer sneezed, ten recruits stepped forward. Reason for the yarn was that staff sergeants couldn’t pronounce those ‘alien’ immigrant names properly. As the war progressed however, new immigrant families felt proud to have one of their ‘boys’ in the forces. They festooned their windows with the U.S flag.So it’s seen that every nation has its own way of inculcating a sense of pride in their armies, especially after a war success, and our country should be no exception.Army moraleBut the delegitimization effort mentioned above was so deliberate, that the armed forces now need a special period of renewal, affirmation and reassurance after that onslaught.But also, military personnel are needed today, as they were needed before, when the nation faces a massive national rebuilding effort made necessary after five years in which almost nothing constructive was done. Boost the morale of the forces, and the morale of the ordinary folk would be boosted too, as such is the symbolism of the soldiers as heroes in a day and age where champions are hard to come by in society at large, except of the synthetic variety on TV, or the cardboard type fueled through primitive urges displayed on social media.Society also feels the need to collectively atone after the horrible treatment of the armed forces in the last five years. Though ordinary people were not responsible for flinging forces personnel in jail — or threatening to do so on flimsy pretexts — they felt helpless in the face of such state aided policy. It’s why they feel they have to ‘atone’ now by helping in the rehabilitation of the armed forces after five of the most ignominious years.You read that right. A certain kind of ‘rehabilitation’ of army morale is necessary after the forces were treated the way they were, often being called names and being made to feel as if they were social outcasts, not rana viruvo but persons with a malady called ‘rana viru gaaya.’ Besides all this, our armed forces need this resurgence as they earned their respect in the trenches. They did so again after the Easter Sunday blasts, by being up to the challenge of maintaining order and allaying anxiety in a trying situation.They have won again. The delegitimization effort against them never worked. But it did damage.If the pride of the forces will be restored, the gutted national psyche will assuredly be repaired too."
19 September 2021,Influencing skills in business leadership vital,"A former American Secretary of State, political scientist, diplomat, and civil servant, Condoleezza Rice, once said, “Power is nothing unless you can turn it into influence”.  People have a choice and they decide the magnitude of service they will offer. The ‘command and control method’ that existed for centuries is now outdated and rarely effective. Hence, the key to successful business leadership is not merely vested power any longer but is how effectively one can influence the followers. The ability to influence is an essential ingredient in leadership skills. The legitimate power vested in a person with a position or a designation by an organisation has no value until and unless such a person can influence his subordinates to trust him. A good leader can have an impact on the behaviour, attitudes, opinions, and choices of his subordinates. Influencing is not manipulating the followers through power by any means.  Influencing is about understanding what subordinates need and what motivates their commitment to the job and then using that knowledge to leverage performance. The key element of influencing is the mutual trust built between the leader and the followers. Effective influencing requires a perfect balance between building rapport and getting desired results. Both these aspects are essential for a leader to be successful as an influencer. Establishing credibilityThe first step of the leader is to build up trust with the staff with integrity, intent, capabilities, and results which are the foundational aspects of establishing credibility. The leader must be completely honest of his intentions and convey that honesty to subordinates for them to clearly understand his motives. After trustworthiness is established through credibility, the influencing process can be effectively practiced with subordinate staff.  Engaging and involving others in the staff early on and seeking their inputs places the leader in a convenient position. Obtaining views of the staff in important decision-making, individually or as a team, builds the mutual bond. By displaying sincerity that matters to others one can build stronger connections with the staff. Influencing can be more effective when the subordinates realise that the leader’s motives are genuine.     To get better outcomes, leaders must persuade and engage followers. However, before engaging employees on their commitment, the leader must clearly define his or her expectations to avoid misunderstandings and confusion. Once the desired result is defined and communicated to the staff, accountability can be established, as individuals and as a group.  If the leader fails to clarify his expectations, accountability cannot be practiced and that can create a low-trust situation. The leader must genuinely be passionate about the staff members, in their official engagements and private lives. The passion of the leader conveys an exceedingly strong message to the followers. They will know whether the leader’s actions are authentic or fake and insincere. It is a proven fact that one of the traits most admired by employees is the leader’s ability to be forward-looking.  Good leaders influence others by sharing their enthusiasm.  Merely by applying influencing skills in the workplace, a manager can persuade and encourage colleagues to fall in line with their goals and ideas. This ultimately helps to accomplish personal success. Therefore, having a lucid and confident knowledge of influencing skills is imperative to a leader.  However, the key point is that the leader has to start applying influencing skills as early as possible.  The leader is dealing with the emotions and attitudes of other people when working. Noticing the surroundings including the work environment, attitudes and the general behaviours of the colleagues is important while visible actions of the people around must be done consciously. Therefore, being aware of the oncoming situations deeply is imperative for the leader to ensure that the counter-reactions are productive.  Communication effectivenessHuman communication has three basic purposes: to educate/inform, to relate, or to influence others. In influencing others at the workplace, all three of these elements are used. Effective communication moves information to the others where influencing based on such information moves ideas into action that produces an impact without being forceful. How effectively a leader can communicate with his superiors, colleagues, and subordinates is an important and integral part of influencing. Active listening skills and empathy are two of the most useful ingredients in communication. By listening actively to the colleagues’ ideas intently and patiently makes the leader more likable to a team that also builds more rapport with them. Empathy is powerAmerican business magnate and founder of Ford Motor Company quoted “If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from his angle as well as your own”. Empathy is an extremely effective and powerful tool in influencing. It is the ability to relate the emotions and experiences of others. Empathetic leaders understand and support others with compassion and sensitivity. Simply explained, empathy is one’s ability to step into someone else’s shoes and be aware of their feelings and needs.  An empathetic leader influences co-workers with deep respect to them and sincerely shows them that he cares about them rather than merely going by rules and regulations. When co-workers feel that the leader understands them implicitly, they feel like a closely bonded team or a family. This feeling increases team morale and loyalty. The leader becomes well-liked and respected by the subordinates if he is truly being empathetic. Critical thinking Critical thinking is another key skill in the workplace concerning influencing staff. The followers’ positive attitude towards the leader known as ‘referent power’ is vital in a work environment. Providing solutions to issues constantly arise in a workplace makes a leader more influential. Leaders who can engage in critical thinking are independent, reflective, and competent. Leaders, as critical thinkers, logically connect ideas, analyze, and evaluate to solve issues posed by the subordinates. They not only accumulate information in a given situation but also use such information to provide solutions to provide the best outcomes.  Consultation Consultation is an effective form of influence. When the team members are invited to contribute to thinking about an issue for subsequent decision-making, they are more likely to be positive about their approach to work. A good leader can turn this positivity into action in order to produce results. However, the leader’s intention must be authentic and the consultation must be done only if the subsequent changes are actually possible. Even if the inputs of the staff cannot be used for decisions, they must be informed of the reasons why such inputs cannot be applied.  Negotiation and persuasion skills are closely linked and aspects of communication. Whilst negotiation skills relate to deciding by discussion and agreements, persuasion is one’s ability to change others’ opinions or behaviours.   In a workplace, frequent disagreements and conflicting views can emerge. Therefore a good leader can use both persuasion and negotiation skills at the correct times and situations to influence the co-workers through dialogues. Successful influencing skills of a leader are naturally charismatic and appealing to strangers when they look at it from the outside. Nevertheless, it is the versatility, knowledge, and competency of the leader. Highly successful leaders are determined by their influencing ability and resourcefulness in the workplace. The success of a team is largely dependent on how skillful the leader is in influencing staff. "
15 March 2020,Retaining and rewarding good performers,"You expect your leadership to recognise and reward only the good performers, but in reality due to many reasons, low performers continue to rule organisations. They build empires and kingdoms using their position and power they acquired which they really didn’t deserve.The reasons can be many but you would agree with me that this is true. Business organisation may succeed even with such leaders when the going is easy but when the going gets tough, you will realise that you cannot take an organisation forward with such ‘fake leaders’Need to deliverYou are employed not for anything else but for tangible results. Leaders must be held accountable for what they do in a business context; but they also need to be held accountable for doing it right too. They need to be held accountable for things under their control that is, operating with a process of quality.They should not be held accountable for uncontrollable events. Conversely, if business leaders only want good results, it is easy to understand that, ultimately, any process to achieve good results will become acceptable — even an illegal process. Some bring in short term results mortgaging the future of the business simply for survival as a leader and later the business has to pick up that cost.This is another way in which managing for results can become the origin of a crisis and bankruptcy. A manager who achieves an excellent result but, in achieving it, has de-motivated his team is clearly not a good leader.Quality of decisionsPeople, including managers and business leaders, typically equate the quality of a decision with the quality of the result. When people observe a good result, they conclude that they made a good decision. Likewise, when a bad result is observed, people conclude that a bad decision was made. This is not true.Decisions and results are two things. Time elapses between a decision and the realisation of its result. Decisions are made at a specific moment in time; thereafter, people implement these decisions, and the result is observed in the future. The future is uncertain: there are no facts about the future, and nobody has a crystal ball.In the future, events can happen where managers and organisations cannot control. Events that managers could not foresee also take place. Such events can cause good decisions to have a bad result — and vice versa.Therefore, the quality of the result is not an indicator of decision quality, and the result is irrelevant as a measure of decision quality.A blame culture triggered by bad results stifles experimentation, innovation or trial and error. If leaders do not tolerate failure and error in business innovations, they will kill the prospect of anyone taking any initiative.Since business is the primary engine for personal income growth, value creation and societal economic development, an organisational culture built on blame and punishment has implications beyond the boundaries of any one business.Taken to national proportions, a blaming culture inhibits societal growth, development and evolution. Managing for results leads to crisis, at the least; it can lead to bankruptcy, at the worst.Companies typically do two things to achieve, on average, better results. First, they implement a good process. Managers can learn to become better business executives. They can learn decision making, learn how to be better at execution and build their business via the knowledge, experience and informed intuition that is inherent in decision making and execution. Through this, managers will find that they are becoming better, more thoughtful business leaders — more aware and better informed about what they are doing.Being compensated only for results doesn’t measure one’s true contributions to the organisation. It is possible that bad managers using wrong processes will sometimes enjoy good results. But their luck will run out eventually. Therefore, in the long run, it is necessary for organisations to evaluate the quality of a manager’s decision-making process over the span of his or her career.Over time, managers will make many decisions and act on it. Organisations should, therefore, reward on the longer-term performance achievements of managers. It may seem controversial, but we firmly believe that even managers with bad results should be rewarded — if they have used good decision-making process. Keeping in mind though that good decisions are for good results, the onus is on you to ensure that good decisions deliver good results leaving luck aside. "
13 September 2020,Nestlé awarded for contribution to coconut industry,"The Sri Lankan coconut authorities awarded Nestlé at an event on World Coconut Day, in recognition of its high foreign exchange contribution as one of the world’s largest exporters of coconut milk powder, and the strategic planning support extended to the Government to help promote the Sri Lankan coconut industry.The award was presented by the State Minister of Plantations, Arundhika Fernando and Minister of Plantations, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana.Nestlé’s Managing Director Fabrice Cavallin said, “We’re proud to be consistently recognised for the positive impact we make for everyone across our business.As a Good food, Good life company, we want our products to not simply be good for our consumers but also good for our community.With almost 800 employees, we have been locally manufacturing over 90% of our products since 1984, at our state-of-the art multi-production factory in Kurunegala.This, together with our strong exports business, has enabled us to contribute significantly to Sri Lanka’s economy.We remain committed to continuing to do good in Sri Lanka, as we have for the last 114 years.” Nestlé also supports more than 9,000 coconut farming families through its business."
5 June 2021,Keep your brand away from politics,"With Covid-19 seriously impacting the country’s economy with negative implications on the majority of businesses, politics has taken the centre stage more than ever before. Literally, everyone has a strong opinion on the performance of the government and political parties.True, it’s hard to avoid discussing politics, especially when it’s the main talking point in the media and especially when most activities are linked to politics in our country. Various political persuasions divide managers and employees in an organisation, so it is certainly not a safe subject to be introduced in the workplace, where it can create a hostile and volatile environment.It’s important to understand that even brief, off-hand comments or questions about politicians, government action that’s not relevant to your business, policies, and outcomes can lead to a heated debate and perhaps even an all-out office war.Similarly, a seemingly harmless action, such as liking a controversial post on Facebook, can put you out of favour with business partners, colleagues, prospects and current or potential customers.Politics is inherently divisive: even small differences in opinion can halt a budding professional relationship in its tracks, or foster an atmosphere of animosity between co-workers.Stay neutralYou never know if the person that you are talking to — be it a potential client or even your own boss — was, is or will be officially involved in certain government activities indirectly or contributing to policy making. They could even be related to a politician at some level. Ninety-nine percent of the time, your political inclination has no influence on whether you can do your job well or not.If someone insists on bringing politics up — either directly or through small talk — try to stay as neutral as possible. If you can, quickly steer the conversation in a different direction. Being candid and saying that you would prefer not to discuss politics in a polite and friendly manner can help maintain a relationship.In our culture, most individuals think that he or she is better than politicians after electing them at the elections. Every individual looks at the performance from their own view point. Most not looking at the broader picture but depending on how the performance impacts them. Some have personal grudges over certain politicians and political parties due to personal experiences and they ignore the rest completely.If you are forced into such a situation where politics come up and you decide to stay on course for whatever reason, just stick to the indisputable facts and avoid laying all your opinions out on the table. If you think that you are missing out on a work opportunity because you don’t want to engage in political talk, then you need to re-evaluate your professional priorities anyway, and consider whether it would be a good idea to enter into business with someone who pushes others into such talk.In my experience, it’s best to stay away from these discussions in office as people don’t judge the performance of governments on a clear criteria including relative economic performance but only based on personal biases. The majority of our voters cannot forego the very basic needs of today to build a strong economy for tomorrow and they are the majority. They will continue to decide who rules the country and who goes to Parliament.Do businesses depend on politics?One common argument is that politics affects the corporate world. Although true, it’s not reason enough to get involved, especially when weighing the risks and mixing up priorities.However, I think there are and should be exceptions to the “no politics” rule, such as when advocating for certain issues, especially those concerning human rights or the environment. You have to know your audience incredibly well before you engage in politics as a business. You should also be very careful of blurring the boundaries between supporting certain policies and partisan politics.The bottom line is that people tend to take politics personally, which makes it harmful to business. It’s, therefore, wise to stay out of it unless, of course, your business is politics.People don’t separate individuals from businesses anymore and therefore your personal thoughts in a public forum can damage your business. Today consumers form relationships with companies not only on the quality of their products and services, but also on how the company behaves and is perceived in the market.Companies today have a wider role than before in society, in other words, they are required to be more responsible and one hundred percent transparent.The implications of this, from a company standpoint, are that it requires a new way of examining who and what it is. This is more time consuming, more strategic and more expensive, but it is necessary. This is an important strategic role for PR in the future and it is already upon us.Mind you, governments can give you back what they collect from you, minus administration cost and any wastage.Don’t fool yourself by blaming governments for your inability to strategise, lack of skills to apply yourself and road map to develop your business. No government can help you with specific knowledge you need and skills required to stay competitive. There is only one way to win - Be the best you can be - Be better than your competition. This is the recipe to succeed in a declining market environment."

8 December 2019,"Peace, business and prosperity","Every nation, community and individual faces social and political impact along with the impact of violence. Interpersonal violence results in medical, policing and judicial costs immediately after the violent incident occurs and it has long term implications on productivity and economic activity.Societal unrest and collective violence destabilise governments and social institutions, as well as reducing business confidence. The combined effect of social disturbance and economic weakness paves the way for further conflict, creating a spiteful cycle.Providing a matrix for measuring peace and understanding the relationships between business, peace and prosperity is becoming ever important in societies today. One of the key publications referred in the article is ‘The Business and Peace report’ published by Institute of Economics and Peace.The economic performance of a country and peace are meticulously interlinked. Peace is an forecaster of performance of any economy, indicating the level of attracting Forging Direct Investments and many other macro level indicators. In business analysis any investor will consider the benefit of peace as a key factor for their decisions.There are two key indicators studying peace aspects and its relationship with economy namely, Global Peace Index (GPI) measuring the absence of violence in an economy and Positive Peace Index (PPI) measuring attitudes and structures in a society that will sustain peace.Countries which had a low level of fear of violence in the past 60 years have reached three times the GDP of countries which had a high level of fear of violence. The comparative and positive growth signs were visible with lower level of inflation, easier access to finance and higher level of FDI.In the Positive Peace Index, high rankers experienced 2% higher GDP growth compared to low PPI rankers. These studies generally are not focused on US and EU where economies are much stronger. The World Bank through its studies has confirmed that there is a tendency to get 8% higher returns on investments compared with countries having low level peace.It is a well established opinion that peace is essential for business performance and private sector led economic growth. Violence due to armed conflicts or crimes impose an additional cost on any business. A high level of peace will ensure improved functionality of markets, increased competitiveness and better institutions.Better performance of an economy may have a positive influence on reducing violence and the poor performance of an economy may bring in disturbance to peace.These two aspects, therefore, which could be considered as strongly interlinked, which may take a destructive direction in a negative environment and it will lead to an extremely constructive situation with a positive impact having a correlation on each other.There are eight pillars interconnecting with each other which affects peace and business namely; Well-Functioning Government, Sound Business Environment, Free Flow of Information, Low Levels of Corruption, Equitable Distribution of Resources, High Levels of Human Acceptance of the Rights of others and Good Relations with neighbours.Well-functioning government: Government policies with respect to private properties, having an independent judiciary and arbitration system will encourage not only FDIs but also local entrepreneurs to invest with confidence. When corruption levels are high, it will make the business environment gloomy for investors. Corruption will make public procurement inefficient while badly affecting corporate investments.Sound business environment: The ability of businesses to adhere to government regulatory requirements which includes efficient Customs processes, access to finance and capital through formal banking systems and other aspects specified by ease of doing business index will lead to a peaceful atmosphere in society.Free flow of information: Free flow of information is vital for proper functioning of businesses and also for the public to have confidence in performing day-to-day activities. From the point of view of business, greater availability of information helps market integration, commercial collaboration and innovations, encouraging new entrants. Studies have confirmed that countries with a free flow of information have a lower level of tariff rates, the reason being the Government will have considerable pressure from the markets with similar comparative information being available.High levels of human capital: It is important for any economy to have a healthy and educated working population and it is a deciding factor for productivity and profitability. There is a tendency that skilled workers may migrate to other geographical markets if the domestic conditions are vulnerable.Acceptance of the rights of others: Acceptance of Rights of others will ensure greater participation of all communities not only in economic and business activities but also in social and cultural activities within the society. This situation will make a greater stock of human resources available for businesses to function effectively.Good relations with neighbours: The relations between States, different ethnic and cultural groups are considered under this aspect. It will ensure a higher level of trade and lower tariffs between economies which will lead to economic growth. The trust and confidence built in each other will drive economies to greater heights.Inflation and peace: Instability of prices would negatively have an impact on savings, consumption and investment. Price volatility will create more risks, reduce profitability and productivity at large.The situation will push authorities to take measures to change monitory policies with higher interest rates which in turn will make it difficult to invest and even for consumption.Low and predictable prices and inflation would bring confidence and a comfortable situation for investors. It is a known fact that low performing economies are having a lower return on investments compared to high performing economies. Long term median inflation prevailing in high peace countries amounts to 3.5% and the same figure in low peace countries, recorded as 9.7%.FDI and peace: FDIs are not only bringing in required finances for the economy, but also the technology, managerial exposure and job creation. Further the FDIs pave the way to be integrated with global trade flows as well. Due to these facts attracting FDIs will play a key role in the growth trajectory of developing countries. If the situation is less peaceful, the investor attraction would also be low and weak.The most peaceful countries including China have received in the recent years on average, 2% of GDP as the FDIs.Business finance and peace: Entrepreneurial skills and finances are considered to be most critical inputs for a business venture. Not only at the inception but even with business expansions it plays a vital part. Peaceful countries are well equipped with financial markets inclusive of capital markets and stock exchanges that could cater to such business necessities.It is vital for low peace countries to face the situation with proven and high standardised accounting and auditing structures, sound credit reporting systems, collateral and insolvency regimes with well functioning payment and settlement mechanisms.It is extremely difficult determining the level of impact and the correlation of the above mentioned eight pillars with each of the other pillars. For example a well functioning Government may lead to free flow of information where free flow of information may lead better function of media institutions. This situation may lead to lower level of corruption which in turn would support the Authorities to function better and transparently.Having a sound business environment would have a positive impact on business transactions where members of the society will be able to solve conflicts in a legal way and within a shortest possible duration as enumerated in doing business index compiled by the world bank.A sound and positive business environment may also create the path to lower unemployment which will have a positive impact on peace which may lead to lower corruption and better governance.It may also work as a vicious cycle in a negative atmosphere where more unemployment will pave the way for unrest in the society. Entrepreneurship is identified as the key factor of the economic growth that has immensely contributed to developed economies reaching their economic goals.The reports reveal that for last six decades, GDP growth had been three times higher in highly peaceful countries and over the last decade GDP per capita had been seven times higher when compared with countries with deteriorated peace levels. Further Foreign direct investment inflows are more than two times higher in countries with higher levels of peace ensuring the continued growth of such economies.Highly peaceful countries are equipped with better functioning formal and non formal institutions with well functioning governments delivering high quality services and infrastructure facilities with a higher level of security incentivizing the businesses to perform well.Economic stagnation is a common look in low peace countries where annual growth of GDP per capita is remaining at very low levels.These countries are in turn more vulnerable with political instability and polarisation, rising unemployment and poverty, economic volatility and inflation. These disorders would form a cyclical effect and will continue to deteriorate the situation further.Reference: Global Peace Index, Positive Peace Index "

25 October 2020," Sales, an attractive profession - provides above-average income","The leadership of all commercial organisations is extremely concerned about business growth.The growth of the organisation is determined by the revenue increase that is known as the Top Line which is mostly linked to the bottom line as it drives the organisational profits. The turnover also determines the share or the power of the particular organisation within their respective industry.Therefore, it is common to see that all business reviews of commercial entities commence with proud emphasis on their revenue growth. Those are the headlines we read in business pages in newspapers. However, do we properly understand how this increased revenue reaches the organisation? Do we realise that it commences with a simple bill written by a salesperson in the market after convincing a customer?Many stakeholders in commercial organisations do not understand that salespeople are the only employees who bring money to the organisation when all others are waiting to spend that money. Of course, organisations invest a major part of that revenue to build infrastructure, launch new products, communicate with consumers, develop employees and do many more activities to ensure their sales people are able to bring more money in the future.Sales people in many industries deal with customers, and not with consumers. All Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), hardware, consumer durables, pharmaceuticals fall into this category. These are the industries that need more sales personnel as they cater to the entire country. The prime responsibility of the sales personnel in these industries is to ensure their products are available in all potential outlets so that consumers can have easy access to them. The role of the sales person in the Insurance Sector or Financial sectors is different as they directly reach the potential customers to introduce insurance policies and credit cards.A recent study conducted by this writer under the guidance of the University of Kelaniya revealed a serious situation in the FMCG sector in Sri Lanka with regard to the retention of their sales people within the same organisation.All companies selected to the sample recorded more than double in their sales force turnover when compared to the rate of total employee turnover of the respective organisation.What does this mean? Does that mean the sales profession in the FMCG industry has more demand than other functions in the same organisation? It is a known fact that the demand increases when the supply is weak. For one profession to have a demand more than the others, it can be argued that the particular profession has inadequate supply of human resources.This has been reiterated as a fact based on the information provided by the industry leaders in the FMCG sector. In addition, a simple study on the vacancies advertised in newspapers and websites dedicated for recruitments have confirmed the same.If that is true, what are the probable contributory factors for that situation? There are some known perceptions regarding the duties and responsibilities of the sales function. It is true that the nature of the sales function in the FMCG sector involves hard work.The sales representative of a FMCG organisation has to be responsible for a certain geographical territory and visit the potential outlets on a planned frequency and talk to the customers and convince them for orders. Many organisations have transferred the responsibility of the stocks in the truck and collection of dealer’s money to their nominated distributor of the area.Therefore, Fast Moving Consumer Goods sales representatives have the primary duty of educating the dealers on the products, special promotions and schemes, and then making the products available, displaying them well and ensuring proper hygiene of their stocks within the outlet.When you consider the physical functions, it is obvious that the sales job involves extensive travelling, walking in the market whether it is hot, dusty or raining, keep standing for long periods during the day, talking to customers whether they welcome you or not, fix display materials and arrange the stocks on shelves.These are the known facts to the outside society and many will look at these functions as difficult, tough and demanding. Obviously that will paint a somewhat negative picture in the minds of the potential youth entering the job market. However, there are so many positive factors related to the profession of sales that is not known to many. When someone enters the profession as a sales representative with positive GCE Advanced Level results, these sales front liners are paid a basic salary generally equal to the clerical staff of the company. But, they receive more than double or triple of that amount as monthly incentives. They are also paid an allowance daily for meals and another fixed monthly base allowance for lodging.This does not include many special schemes conducted by companies during the year offering their salespersons cash prizes, foreign trips and other gifts. Therefore, the front liners in the sales profession receive an above average, more than double or almost triple the income compared to many other professions with similar educational qualifications. When entering the job market, another important factor considered by many is the availability of a career path in the selected profession. In the function of sales, there is a very clear corporate path upwards.The structure of the sales force in a typical FMCG company has Sales Representatives at the bottom and then the immediate upward layer is Sales Supervisors or Sales Executives. Above them, you find Area Sales Managers or Regional Sales Managers. Some companies have Field Sales Managers as the next layer and the top position is held by the National Sales Manager as the Head of the Sales Division.Most of the time, the top position holders of FMCG companies emerge from the bottom layer. They are not necessarily from the same company but when you look at them as a profession, it is obvious that except in a very few instances, the top layers are occupied by those who climbed up from the bottom with effective results, wealth of experience and obtaining educational qualifications such as Diplomas in Marketing or Sales, External Degrees and MBAs. From the time they start climbing up, fringe benefits such as company vehicles, attractive salaries, international training and many allowances are available for them.With all above positive factors, why have we failed to attract talented youth who are entering into the job market for the large number of opportunities available in the sales profession? It is a profession where they can receive an above average remuneration package and can look forward to an excellent career progression.When you look at many FMCG organisations in Sri Lanka, there is an unproportionately high number of CEOs who have come through this path. Almost all heads in the sales division in the FMCG industry in Sri Lanka have come from the bottom layers. If these are the facts, how come we still find it difficult to show these live examples to motivate qualified youth and upgrade the quality of the sales profession particularly in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods industry in Sri Lanka? It is the moral duty of all those who have come on this channel to the Top to show the path for those who are not aware of the true potential of the sales profession.The writer holds a MBA (UK) and EDBA (Colombo) and is a business consultant, corporate director and visiting lecturer. "
21 February 2021,SEC encourages companies to list,"The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) conducted a forum for the Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) of several private companies recently to encourage them to list on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).The SEC has had a continuous dialogue with all stakeholders of the capital market and has emphasised on the need to take aggressive measures to develop the market in order to ensure that it is the preferred place to raise capital. Only a few companies have listed on the CSE during the past several years and that was seen as one of the reasons for inadequate level of liquidity and relatively small size of the market. The SEC recently approved a new framework for listing of companies, granting complete autonomy to the CSE in the listing process and has also relaxed the Listing Rules to encourage more listings.The aim of the forum was to reach out to companies that are not listed in order to make them aware of the benefits of getting listed and to apprise them of the key proposals included in the  Government’s  budget for 2021 which has provided certain tax exemptions to companies which list before December 31.  The Chairman of the SEC Viraj Dayaratne made the opening remarks and outlined the advantages of obtaining a listing, especially during the current positive market environment and said the process involved in listing a company was not as cumbersome or expensive as is generally perceived. He requested them to take the message to their respective Boards.Presentations were made by the Chief Regulatory Officer (CRO) of the CSE, Renuke Wijayawardhane and Commission members of the SEC,  Manil Jayesinghe and Naresh Abeysekera. Wijayawardhane outlined the requirements and processes involved in listing and Jayesinghe explained in detail how listing on the CSE was an attractive option for companies to raise funds. He highlighted as to why this method of raising capital was more advantageous than other methods through which a company was able to raise capital.Naresh Abeysekera outlined how the digital platform can be used to raise capital in the near future and benefits that listed companies can derive from the CSE mobile application.The forum concluded with a panel discussion featuring the Chairman, the two Commission members, Director General Chinthaka Mendis and the CRO of the CSE. The panel discussion created the space for a dialogue between the panelists and the CFOs who participated at the forum. The SEC plans to organise events where the Chairmen and CEOs of companies would be spoken to, to take this initiative forward."

18 April 2021,EFC hosts forum on “IT-integrated remote work culture”,"The first edition of the HR/IR Forum for 2021 of the Employers’ Federation of Ceylon (EFC) was held recently on the theme “IT-integrated remote work culture: Pandemic and Beyond”.The webinar-forum which brought together experts in HR/IR, Industrial and Labour Law and disability sector from the EFC and its member-companies, deliberated on opportunities and challenges a remote work culture driven by IT entails in the pandemic-clouded environment. It also brought to the table the shifts to be forged in an IT-driven work culture beyond the pandemic. Opening the forum, Head of Business Transformation, Hirdaramani Group, Kelum Herat-Gunaratne provided a snapshot of the labour-intensive, diversified conglomerate’s key areas of business impact due to the pandemic which included both primary and supporting activities. With an unprecedented toll on sales due to market and operation closure, non-supply of raw materials all of which had a ‘domino effect on operations’ as Herat-Gunaratne explained, the company was driven to adapt mitigation strategies which were largely IT-fuelled.“All were counting on technology as the answer. Infrastructure and finance too had a huge role to play and we strategised collectively to see how we could adapt to this new environment.” The IT-HR fusion gave new interventions a further thrust. Resources for remote work, adapting a change in the work culture, and health and safety of the employees were among the core strategies adopted, said the senior professional who went on to remark that the flip-side of the pandemic was that it ‘fast-tracked the implementation of Hirdaramani’s digital transformation strategy’, he said.Amplifying the existing processes and leveraging the right technology, pushed WSO2 to brave Covid-induced business challenges, said Vice President, Human Resources and Administration at WSO2, Udeshika Ratnavira. Citing monthly town halls, buddy chats, employee surveys, interactive onboarding sessions, support to set up home offices and creating awareness on coping with crisis as chief strategies embraced by her company.“Employees were missing out on social experience, their mental health was affected, brainstorming sessions were difficult on the phone and there were domestic interventions impacting work which we had to take stock of,” she said.With the challenges, learnings were also many said the HR professional who cited prioritising costs and essentials, investing in technology, fostering a larger and a deeper pool of talent, connectedness, communication, agility, thinking global and wellness among them.Head of Solutions, Legal and HR and Assistant Director General of the EFC, Sewwandi Jayatunga Wijesekera shared some of the common legal concerns raised by the EFC members in navigating through the new business fabric brought about by the pandemic. Deviations from the terms in the contract of employment, new work arrangements, leave and holidays, remuneration and benefits, monitoring the performance of probationers and poor performers and managing discipline were among these. "

14 February 2021,Psychological factors affecting entrepreneurship,"The entrepreneur spirit is a factor that cannot be turned off easily when a person forms an idea to launch a business. Most often entrepreneurs are known to be committed, passionate, and engaged with people during every waking hour, throughout their lives. Particularly, when the business is growing, even if they can relax, they do not usually let go. In my opinion, two factors influence this phenomenon; the first is the persistent hunger for growth and the second is fear of failure and losing what was built. These are the two factors that drive them to success. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that mental health is not a mere absence of mental challenges but it is the psychological well-being in which every individual realises his or her own potential.  An entrepreneur is described as a person who passionately pursues an idea or concept. In other words, according to legendary and iconic entrepreneur Steve Jobs, they are “the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world”. Entrepreneurs are most often described as go-getters with infinite aspirations and inventive minds. When they are into businesses, over time, they invariably display fearlessness when they are making headway. Business psychologists agree that energetic people, who are motivated to relentlessly pursue a target, are often successful in business, but more likely to have strong emotional conditions sooner or later.      AloneEntrepreneurs are often alone by choice. They have friends, family, acquaintances, and their team with them. Yet, the state of the business endeavour is left on their shoulders making them feel alone constantly. They have to put up a front to keep the team, the investors, friends, and family to make them trust. Bearing the brunt of all worries and anxieties can create a pretty lonely space for entrepreneurs in the long run. Hence, the continuation of this inevitable occurrence can cause a psychological imbalance for the entrepreneurs, if not properly addressed on time. The British based Business Growth Fund (BGF), one of the most active investment companies in the United Kingdom has revealed that 53% of entrepreneurs ‘never turn off’ while another 20% work over 80 hours a week. Nevertheless, in Sri Lanka, these percentages can be more. This is certainly a calling on the mental health of entrepreneurs. Hence, a balance must be created between business and personal lives to avoid late-life repercussions. Identifying the magnitude of risk of mental health issues due to entrepreneurial endeavours is not an easy task. Most often entrepreneurs are heads down on the success of their respective entities; they pay little or no attention to the signs of stress. The stress created through this action can be factors such as despair on failure, negative issues in personal lives, poor sleep and eating habits, and change in emotions. Most of the successful businessmen I have met commonly declared that they are at their peak when they work under pressure. Many of them say that when they relax, they tend to slip important issues, specifically in decision making.  In my opinion, although this judgment has some truth, the long-term repercussion on mental health can be detrimental.    To others around successful businessmen, it is hard to imagine that they take a negative psychological toll as they visibly display luxurious lifestyles and create illustrious impressions in society. However, the truth is that most entrepreneurs lead comfortable lives, but not extravagantly as a small percentage who are billionaires.Nevertheless, the goal of almost all entrepreneurs is inspired by the most successful entrepreneurs. Similar to the richest, achieving goals and maintaining success is the main aim of every entrepreneur. However, the reality is that success turns up naturally with a psychological price. Depression and anxiety often exist with most of them causing mental health concerns, often followed by negative physical concerns. Under pressureSeveral successful businessmen I have spoken with on the subject matter unanimously confirmed that they are constantly under pressure throughout the day, week, month, and the year with renewing business-related issues since the inception of entrepreneurship. Almost every person said that the tension intensifies with the business growth.A relatively young successful businessman and a mature entrepreneur shared the same sentiment on the subject of constant stress and anxiety. However, even if they are conscious about the mental toll, they say they can do very little to circumvent it due to the nature of responsibilities lying on their shoulders.   Dealing with stress and anxiety is one of the core business psychology topics discussed by psychologists around the globe. The nature of business is that every day, everything must be right even though in reality it is not so.  For example, businessmen think that the revenue must go up, employees and customers must be happy, products must be improved, and much more. However, the truth is that almost every day the business takes two steps forward and one step back or vice versa.Therefore, entrepreneurs must be prepared to face this bitter truth. If not, there is a high possibility that they will endure undue mental pressure that will cause anxiety to build up. If an entrepreneur lets these emotions confront them, their business decisions will get affected. It is a proven fact that the decisions made under influence of stress can be damaging in the long-run.  Inability to deal with rejections or failures is a strong issue for entrepreneurs. The two factors are strongly interconnected in any business, anywhere in the world. It is not only a common phenomenon in business practice but also a necessity as the entrepreneur confronts various business-related concerns regularly as a common occurrence. Similarly, failures also are a habitual factor in entrepreneurship. The entrepreneur’s intentions or innovative ideas do not always materialise the way he or she anticipates. Most successful business leaders in the world declare that they have encountered more failures than successes. However, persistency will ultimately accumulate success. The important point is that although rejections and failures hurt, by being in control of emotions, the negative mental stress can be kept in check.FacadeAnother notable mannerism of almost all entrepreneurs is to act as if everything is perfect even at the edge of failure. By creating this façade, entrepreneurs attempt to maintain the confidence of the stakeholders of the business intact for as long as possible. No businessman wants to appear weak in front of his team, customers or colleagues. This type of behaviour can lead to stress and consequent depression later.  Renowned American psychologist and the founder of the ‘humanistic approach’ (client-centered approach) warns that human beings are disturbed when expectations are not met. It is more so with people with an entrepreneur mentality who frequently show strong behavioural patterns. Hard-working businessmen can easily get depressed when they cannot achieve what is expected. It is for these reasons that experts say that entrepreneurs must learn to be open-minded about the eventualities whether it is positive or negative. The recommendation in such conditions is for the entrepreneurs to take time off from business-related activities to rest and revitalise physically and mentally. However, in reality, the irony is that most Sri Lankan entrepreneurs go on holidays but never switch off from business activities. The mental well-being of entrepreneurs is connected to the welfare of many and is also directly related to the economy of the country as well. Therefore, entrepreneurs, particularly small and medium scale, must realise that emotional difficulties are not signs of weakness. It is another common fact in their lifestyles. The emotional balance of every entrepreneur is of paramount importance as they collectively provide a living for millions of others. Hence, taking a proactive approach to prevent omnipresent mental disturbances is essential. "
14 June 2020,Make timely moves to stay competitive,"Many things cause organisational change. Covid 19 is one big example only. Other than pandemics or epidemics, economic downturns, tougher trading conditions, finance cost escalation, technological changes, competitive pressures, including mergers and acquisitions, customer pressure, particularly shifting markets and government legislation or regulatory changes.All organisations are in flux: changing their focuses, expanding or contracting activities and rethinking their products and services. Most organisations more than ten years look nothing like they did even five years ago. Pre and post Covid 19 are two different worlds altogether. And it is likely that in the next year or two organisations will not look as they do today.In this context managers should introduce and manage change to ensure the organisational objectives of change are met, and they have to ensure that they gain the commitment of their people, during and after implementation. Often, at the same time, they also have to ensure that business continues as usual.Resistance to change may be active or passive, overt or covert, individual or organised, aggressive or timid and on occasions totally justified. Organisational change management takes into consideration the processes and tools that managers use to make changes at organisational level.Most organisations want change implemented with the least resistance and with the most buy-in as possible. For this to occur, change must be applied with a structured approach so that transition from one type of behaviour to another is smooth.As the speed of change continues to increase, change management is a fundamental competency needed by managers, supervisors, Human Resources staff, and organisation leaders. To tap your wisdom, my recent survey about change management afforded me the opportunity to consolidate hundreds of years of experience in change management.Change is possible; the need for change is increasing; change capability is necessary for organisations that will succeed in the future. Change management challenges organisations to succeed during times of great change.Employees love to stay in their comfort zone because it is familiar and they know what their expectations are. Many employees fear change and the manager has the responsibility to help employees move through the change process. Managers need to develop themselves as a role model for change and create an environment where all employees will get aboard and be willing to make the changes that are needed. It takes a smart and intuitive manager to manage change in any business organisation.For a manager to effectively manage change in the business setting, they need to develop an understanding of how employees react to change. Every employee will have a different view of change and reaction to change.It is important that the manager stays visible and is always willing to jump in and help the employees manage change. To be an effective manager of change, the employees must continue to feel valued and respected by their manager. If a manager helps the employees through the process of learning to let go of the old way of doing things, they can help the employee adjust to the changes in their working environment.ResistanceWhen a manager is facilitating change in the business world, they need to be aware and acknowledge that resistance to change is normal and common. Smart managers will recognise that resistance to change can actually be viewed as a positive sign that the employees are involved with the changes that are occurring in their working environment.If employees do not believe in their managers and lack trust in their decisions or there has been no explanations of the reasons for change and how it will benefit the employees, that manager will have difficulty managing any changes that need to be implemented.Another effective tool for a manager to implement change in the business setting is to involve the employees in the decisions that are being made to change their working environment. This is a method to help the employees feel valued and more motivated to go along with the implementation of the changes.This becomes a win-win situation for the organisation, the manager and the employees. Managers that involve their employees and let them become part of the change will have an easier road for acceptance from the employees. Communication is the manager’s best friend.That is how the manager prepares the employees for the changes and can clearly clarify the expectations and expected outcomes. The manager is the individual who can clearly communicate the rationale for the change and answer the employees’ questions and stress the importance for the change to occur. Managers need to remain positive and upbeat and show the employees they are energised to make the changes happen.There are always some risks when changes are being initiated. The manager needs to be ready for the potential negative effects of any changes and have a plan to handle them. If mistakes occur along the way, then this is the opportunity for the manager and the employees to learn from the mistakes and move forward. Organisations that have a talented and effective manager will handle the changes that need to occur to keep them competitive in their industry. "
23 February 2020,Tourism industry confident of achieving seven million arrivals in five years ,"The tourism industry can achieve seven million arrivals in five years provided the Government adequately supports the overall industry in marketing and assures national security, said NKAR Travels and Tours (Pvt) Limited Managing Director and past Vice President of the Travel Agents Association of Sri Lanka, Nilmin Nanayakkara, in an interview with Sunday Observer Business.Excerpts from the interview:Q. The tourism industry took a nose dive after the 2019 Easter Sunday attack. How far have we recovered from the impact of that?A. That was the most unfortunate incident the country had to face since the end of the war against terrorism. Not only the precious lives were lost but also the whole country suffered, including tourism, by way of economic restraints. I think the tourism industry was the most affected.The irony is that when looking back, I feel this could have been averted if the authorities were a bit more vigilant. Due to the negligence of a few, tourism industry went through the most turbulent period from April last year.It was regrettable that there was no properly planned or well designed recovery process by those responsible in the then Government. There was only public addressing with idle promises. It is very evident that the trade has recovered by itself without much assistance from the Government.It most certainly was not due to the championship of the then tourism authorities.The biggest blow was the travel advisories by various countries. Travel trade organisations, mainly, Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) and The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) contributed immensely to the recovery by way of negotiating and talking to the diplomatic missions.Q. You said that the Government did not adequately provide assistance in the aftermath of the incident. Can you elaborate?A. Even for business entities, which were struggling to obtain soft loans under the scheme were in dire straits due to slow decision making. Most institutions got their soft loans after about five months of struggle. This was due to lack of responsibility and leadership by the then Finance Ministry.Unfortunately, lots of small timers did not get any support under this scheme.It showed a progressive demand since last November in the arrivals of bottom end. Young and risk-taking tourists made the first move taking the advantage of low pricing.Thanks to Google and as the social media was very active, it was immensely helpful for the recovery. They were the sole promoters for the industry and not the then Sri Lankan tourism authorities, too true but sad to say.Q. Now we are facing a different type of an obstacle in coronavirus. What is the impact of that?A. The industry is heading for the second disaster within one financial year. As the tourism industry professionals, we are appreciative of the fact that China, on their own, prevented holiday makers and group travellers visiting other countries. However, the fact remains that China is the second largest tourist market for Sri Lanka. When that was unplugged, the industry got into troubled times in business of course. There are also hotels which are solely dependent on Chinese guests.I honestly think that on President Rajapaksa’s directive, the Health Ministry, Tourism and Aviation Ministry, Foreign Ministry, Sri Lanka Tourism, Sri Lankan Airlines managed this crisis situation effectively. Bringing down the students stranded in Wuhan was the pinnacle. That offered maximum confidence to the world about effective crisis management abilities of Sri Lanka.Chinese nationals domiciled in Sri Lanka, operating tour business without licence have gone quiet. They were undermining the licensed operators.They are not concerned or bothered of the future of the industry. They are there when the times are good, when the times are bad, like now, they vanish.It’s only the traditional licensed DMCs who are now chasing other markets that will help themselves and the economy. The Tourism Authority must realise this and not allow unscrupulous foreign operators to undermine the tourism business in Sri Lanka, including accommodation, restaurants and other services.Q.Tourism must recover from the current turmoil as early as possible. As an industry veteran what are the immediate strategies you recommend?A. We, as a Destination Management Company, are extremely pleased about President Rajapaksa’s approach to this all-important business which brings a large amount of much needed foreign currency. Chapter four of the manifesto of President Rajapaksa states his vision about the tourism industry.Having seen his unyielding perseverance, the whole industry believes that the future of this business will achieve maximum growth. The soft loan scheme must be extended further to help the industry with easier payback conditions. Whilst appreciating the VAT reduction given to the Hotels, I must state that the tour operators were neglected there again placing full burden on them with no input credit on VAT.It is regrettable that successive Governments have overlooked the contribution of tour operators who bring in 60% to 70% tourists to the country. It also is a hard fact that these tour operators collectively spend over Rs. 1.5 billion annually from their marketing budget for tourism promotion.We strongly believe that the President and the Government must seriously consider these facts to recognise the tour operators (DMCs) role.When Tour Operators (DMC’s) invest in promotions, we promote the country.Q. What should be done to maximise the Return on Investment (ROI) of the tourism industry on the whole?A. We need to create opportunities for tourists to spend on extra activities, on F&B, entertainment and perhaps on shopping as well. It is extremely urgent to introduce a Capacity Management Plan before we run into a huge surplus situation of rooms which will lead to a price war and dumping.If you have a proper Capacity Management Plan one does not need to run around requesting the introduction of minimum rate structures that would not sustain in a competitive market.In case the capacity of rooms are more of different categories as against the projected and planned number of arrivals certainly there is an issue and return on investment (ROI) would get lean due to competition. We must plan to prevent this situation in advance so that dead investment on accommodation could be prevented and this will be a huge stress reliever to the economy.Q. Finally, how important economically is tourism and promotion of tourism to the country at large?A. The President has already answered this many times. He has set a goal of seven million arrivals in five years with a monetary target of US$ 10 billion.I can confidently say that this can be achieved provided the Government adequately supports the overall industry in marketing and assure of national security.While the Government has to look after these two areas, we DMCs (the tour operators) will bring 60% to 70% of the set target. "
18 July 2021,Rugby referees and match officials get down to business,"Sri Lanka Rugby (SLR) and the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association (SLSRFA) have called on the rest of the sport’s stakeholders in the country to recommence the game at both club and school level.Former referee Dinka Peiris who was elected president of the Sri Lanka Society of Rugby Football Referees (SLSRFR) at their AGM held on January 9, 2021 said that his priority will be to develop match officials (referees) with the assistance of senior referees.These senior officials are renowned in World Rugby and accredited either as educators, trainers, performance reviewers and coaches of match officials.Dilroy Fernando will be the chairman of the Training, Development and Education section as he is the most qualified and is currently a performance reviewer and trainer at Asia Rugby.Vimal Perera will head the Review Committee (CMO in ARFU), Anil Jayasinghe (member of the MO Selection committee at ARFU) will be the coach of match officials while Tony Amit will head the Assignment Committee.Nizam Jamaldeen (Member of ARFU Referee’s Committee) and Shamrath Fernando (CMO of ARFU) have been assigned the task of marketing and sponsorship of rugby while Rohan Fernando (former MO) will head the strength and fitness segment along with Nilco Bandara.“All these officials will be monitored and answerable to the General Committee as per the (SLSRFR) Constitution,” said Peiris.“I am happy with the committee and the development work done headed by Dilroy Fernando and his support team. Though the game has not taken to the field yet, we are geared to take the field,” said Dinka Peiris.They had a two day workshop on March 6 and 7 at Longden Place under the banner “To Be The Best We Can.” The Workshop was facilitated by Dilroy Fernando.The short term plan is to have six quality referees by the end of 2021 who will be able to handle any A division school or club fixture. The long term plan is to have a minimum of two in the Asian Rugby top panel and have at least four in the Asia Rugby Emerging Panel by end of 2023. Aaqil Jamaldeen and Dilum Deeshana are the two MOs in the Asia Rugby Development Panel.As the first hurdle the Association has selected nine potential match officials to the A panel. They are Priyantha Gunaratne, Aaqil Jamaldeen, Hasantha Weranga, Ishanka Abeyakoon, Dilum Deeshana, Ravin Alexander, Kelum Sandaruwan, Gihan Yatawara and Isuru Perera.Dilroy Fernando together with Rohan Fernando and Anil Jayasinghe conducted training, education and development programs every Saturday.When asked about the payments yet to be received from SLR that was due for nearly three years, Peiris said that he is negotiating with its president Rizly Illyas and was confident they will find a way to pay the due amount for the services rendered by SLSRFR."
23 May 2021,Manufacturing declines in April,"Following the seasonal pattern, manufacturing PMI contracted to 44.3 in April with a decline of 22.7 index points from March 2021. This was mainly due to the significant declines in production, new orders, stock of purchases, and employment sub-indices compared to the significant expansion recorded in March. The new orders significantly declined with the end of the Sinhala and Tamil new year seasonal demand, particularly in the manufacture of food and beverage sector. Production, especially in the manufacture of food and beverages and textile and wearing apparel sectors declined significantly due to the lesser number of working days in the month and the drop in employment, especially due to the increase in unauthorised absentees following the New Year holidays.The resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic in the latter part of April prevented many employees from reporting to work and refrained some employers from employing their entire workforce. The Stock of Purchases contracted in line with the decline in New Orders and Production, and increased uncertainty. Many respondents, particularly in the manufacture of food and beverages sector emphasised that they reduced their purchases with the end of the seasonal demand.The Suppliers’ Delivery Time lengthened at a higher pace in April 2021 mainly due to the delays in receiving imported and local supplies. Many respondents highlighted that freight rates remained at elevated levels, increasing the cost of imported raw materials, which in turn adversely affected their profit margins.The manufacturers cautioned that the uncertainty over the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic would hamper the manufacturing activities in the country. Overall expectations for manufacturing activities for the next three months deteriorated significantly compared to the previous month.  Purchasing Managers’ Indices for Manufacturing and Services activities contracted in April.PMI dropped to 48.9 in April 2021, reversing the growth momentum observed in the Services sector for four straight months. This decline was underpinned by the deteriorations observed in new businesses, business activities, employment and expectations for activity.New businesses and business activities in the services sector decreased in April 2021, particularly with the declines observed in transportation, education and insurance sub-sectors.Other personal services sub-sector also experienced a decrease in Business activities in April 2021. Extensive holidays in April amidst the impact from the onset of the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic towards the latter part of the month led this moderation of Business activities in the services sector.Accommodation, food and beverage and wholesale and retail trade sub-sectors saw improvements in April 2021 mainly due to the surge in demand for goods and services during the Sinhala and Tamil new year season.Employment also declined due to retirements amid absence of new recruitment in April 2021. Backlog of work increased in April 2021 after declining for two consecutive months due to localized lockdowns and implementation of roster systems amid the surge in Covid-19 cases."

21 March 2020,Steps to be taken to avoid shortage of essentials,
9 February 2020, Mahindananda tells Mangala: Mind your party’s business,"UNP Parliamentarian Mangala Samaraweera making a rare appearance in Parliament after the Presidential Election gave a lengthy speech in the well of the House being highly critical of the new Government’s economic policy. State Minister of Power Mahindananda Aluthgamage who rejected MP Samaraweera’s claims called upon the UNP politicos to mind the issues within their party and to set their house in order first without questioning the Government’s economic strategies.State Minister Aluthgamage who dealt a verbal blow to Samaraweera’s remarks told the House that the entire country witnessed the histrionics of Samaraweera when he was the Finance Minister. He said the Yahapalana Government lost its foothold because of the conduct of Samaraweera. State Minister Aluthgamage said Samaraweera is the one who came out with war crime allegations against his country and added that he is always on the NGO bandwagon cow towing to foreign forces.He also said it is alright for Samaraweera to make such absurd statements and derive pleasure out of it. He may be waiting to become the Finance Minister once again but that can never be realized in this life.Before State Minister Aluthgamage wound his speech, Samaraweera was getting ready to leave the Chamber. Then the State Minister told Samaraweera that it is better if he could listen to the rest of his speech and leave the Chamber thereafter.Aluthgamage questioned Samaraweera in a vociferous manner whether he doesn’t have the backbone to listen to his speech. However, Samaraweera was seen leaving the Chamber without listening to the State Minister.The State Minister told the House whenever the UNP ran a Government it always increased taxes, put the burden on the masses and swindled public funds. Whenever we were in the Government, we slashed taxes, lifted the pressure off from people and gave them concessions and facilities as much as possible.State Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara who spoke after State Minister Aluthgamage was also critical of the speech made by Samaraweera. He said “When I listened to Mangala Samaraweera’s speech, I conjured up the image of the Devil chanting ‘Pirith’ before us.The people however, reacted by sprinkling ‘dummala’ and exorcising the Devil forever! Nobody listens to Mangala’s ‘Pirith’, veteran Parliamentarian Nanayakkara remarked in lighter vein and added that if one follows Samaraweera’s steps, one will surely end up at ‘Kanatte’.”Mangala Samaraweera in his speech vehemently criticized the Government’s economic strategy and said the Government has failed to deliver on the pledges made to the public.He said the present Government cancelled all productive programs implemented by the former Government. When State Minister Nanayakkara interrupted MP Samaraweera, the latter turned towards Nanayakkara and told him in lighter vein, “When everything is being slashed today and if this trend continues surely my friend Vasu’s mustache might soon catch fire.” However, MP Samaraweera appreciated the speech of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa during the Independence Day celebrations.He said the President should ensure that he doesn’t come under the influence of reactionary forces. Although all leaders wanted to do something for the country, unfortunately they came under the influence of reactionary forces.The President needs to make strong decisions within democratic traditions in the larger interest of the country.”UNP Parliamentarian Ranjan Ramanayake’s controversial leaked telephone conservations once again turned into a hot topic in the well of the House. UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra questioned why the MPs could not obtain copies of the CD containing the telephone call recordings handed over by MP Ramanayake to the Parliament Hansard Department.MP Premachandra said when she went to the library to obtain a copy of the CDs, they refused to give her a copy. She said there was a big hue and cry following Ramanayake’s leaked telephone recordings which caused much embarrassment to her. Later a decision had been taken at the Party Leaders’ meeting on Friday, February 7 to release seven telephone call recordings presented in Parliament by MP Ramanayake.It had also been decided that prior to release of the CDs to re-edit the recordings deleting indecent language and any matters relating to national security.UNP Parliamentarian Hesha Vithanage indulged in some criticism of the state media when Media Minister Bandula Gunawardana was in the Chamber.Minister Gunawardana losing his composure flatly rejected the MP’s claim and told him the entire country could witness as to how the media was abused by the Yahapalana Government.Those days, they even brought ‘crocodiles’ and ‘sharks’ to the TV stations not for anything but to sling mud at President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.Chief Government Whip Johnston Fernando disclosed to the House the details of a monumental sum of Rs.2.8 billion spent for the purchase of vehicles during the tenure of the former Yahapalana Government.The Minister who responded to a query by JVP Parliamentarian Nalinda Jayatissa told the House that the JVP is also part and parcel of this as it also strove to protect the Yahapalana Government and also tried its best to prevent that Government from being toppled at various critical stages.The Minister told the JVP members that they can’t simply wash their hands by just raising questions on the issue and making suggestions.Minister Fernando said the JVP being a stronger supporter of the Yahapalana regime could have objected to the purchase of vehicles and cut down on waste so that the outstanding issues of pensioners and scan machines could have been resolved.However, State Minister Amaraweera responding to the vehicle issue denied the fact that a Mercedes Benz vehicle worth Rs,42 million had been provided to him during the Yahapalana regime.Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa responding to a question by UPFA Parliamentarian Anuradha Jayaratne told Parliament that not a single recipient of the houses of the new villages constructed by the National Housing Development Authority during the period 2015 to 2019 have received deeds confirming ownership.The Premier said the number of actual housing units constructed is far less than stated. He said the previous Government claimed that 2,562 model villages consisting of 65,097 houses were constructed during the period 2015 to 2019.On the contrary, during that period only 9,604 houses in 367 model villages had been constructed. State Minister of Housing Indika Anuruddha referring to the question said former Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa had spent one billion rupees as publicity for the 367 model villages.At this point Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa sought permission from the Prime Minister to ask an additional question over his statement but Premier Rajapaksa told Premadasa that he could direct his question to State Minister Indika Anuruddha.Chief Government Whip Minister Johnston Fernando who responded to a question raised by UPFA Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila on the former Government’s one million job program said that Government had not implemented its much-advertised one million job program though it was one of its key election pledges.Minister Fernando said the former Government cheated the youth by promising one million jobs. The Minister said this proves that the youth and the people cannot be cheated any longer.UNP Parliamentarian Kabir Hashim in response said the statistics at the ETF would testify to the increased number of jobs during the tenure of the former Government."
23 August 2020,External sector stabilised further in June,"The trade deficit declined in June 2020 (year-on-year), with a more than expected rebound in merchandise exports and notable reduction in merchandise imports on account of restrictions on non essential imports. Workers’ remittances recorded a growth in June, for the first time since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.The government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recorded some outflows. Supported by the reduction in the trade deficit, the Sri Lankan rupee recorded a marginal appreciation during June 2020. The deficit in the trade account narrowed in June 2020 to US dollars 161 million, from US dollars 316 million in June 2019, recording the lowest monthly deficit since August 2009. Also, on a cumulative basis, the trade deficit narrowed by US dollars 335 million to US dollars 3,262 million during the first six months of 2020 from US dollars 3,597 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Meanwhile, terms of trade, i.e., the ratio of the price of exports to the price of imports, declined by 7.3 per cent (year-on-year) in June 2020 with prices of exports declining at a faster pace than those of imports. Earnings from merchandise exports rebounded sharply, recording US dollars 894 million in June 2020 compared to US dollars 587 million recorded in May 2020. The gradual resumption of economic activities of the country as well as the recovery of both domestic and global supply and demand chains to some extent contributed to this improvement.The earnings from textiles and garments exports led the increase from May 2020 to June 2020, followed by rubber products, food beverages and tobacco, seafood and spices. However, compared to June 2019, earnings from merchandise exports declined significantly by 17.5 per cent in June 2020. The year-on-year decline in earnings from exports was led by industrial exports.Earnings from textiles and garments contributed the most to the decline in June 2020, on a year-on-year basis, despite the increase in earnings from personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks and protective suits, categorised under other made up articles.Earnings from most subcategories of industrial exports including transport equipment, petroleum products, gems, diamonds and jewellery and animal fodder declined, year-on-year, during the month. Despite the increase of surgical and other gloves exports, earnings from rubber products declined, mainly driven by lower exports of tyres.However, earnings from food, beverages and tobacco (led by liquid coconut milk, coconut cream and manufactured tobacco), plastics and articles thereof (led by plastic clothing articles) and chemical products (led by activated carbon) exports increased in June 2020 compared to June 2019.Earnings from agricultural exports grew considerably by 12.0 percent on a year-on-year basis in June 2020, for the first time since May 2019.This increase was led by all subcategories of agriculture exports except for unmanufactured tobacco. Earnings from tea recorded a growth after 10 months in June 2020 driven by higher average export prices of tea although the volume exported recorded a minor decline.Higher earnings were recorded in minor agricultural products led by higher exports of arecanuts, fruits and betel leaves.Earnings from spices increased with higher export volumes of cinnamon and pepper, while earnings from coconut increased as a result of higher average export prices of kernel products and higher export volumes of non kernel products. However, on a month-on-month basis, the improvement of the export volume index was substantially high at 61.7 percent while the deterioration of the unit value index was relatively low at 5.7 per cent, in June 2020 compared to May 2020. "

19 September 2021,Cost of office gossip and job jealousy ,"With the overwhelming response received for last Sunday’s Biz Talk under the topic “Bad Leaders promote gossip at the expense of profits”, I did a follow up article on the need to really assess the cost of office gossip and take steps to eliminate it for profits.Most people who gave feedback said that it’s common and they have either been victimised directly or they are aware of the huge financial loss incurred as a result. The majority believed that most Sri-Lankan business leaders have this weakness. Serious repercussions including total company bankruptcy have been cited as feedback in my social media.  “Say the right thing at the right time when the right people are present with the pure intention of sustaining or growing business value through people.”  This statement connotes that it has to be factors affecting the business and not directed at people and it’s openly discussed for the people to take notice of and decide on the timely action.Here are a few examples of the cost of workplace gossip. Gossip conversations can grow like wildfire and may even result in an employee being disgruntled and simply marking time without making any positive contribution in protest or to an employee leaving the job.It’s generally the good, no nonsense performers, who would leave an organisation. Most leaders have no sense as to how this correlates to business results. It creates an environment in which the poor and incapable employees would find refuge. Such employees cannot survive in an environment where performance goals are well set, measurement criteria is scientific, policies and value violations are not tolerated. Divisiveness grows among employees as people may “take sides”.Morale of the good performers would be eroded and they will not give out their best beyond that. Expected synergies through collective decision making and cross functional collaboration on execution for org-wide results will only be a dream. Characteristics of gossipersGossip mongers stir up anytime with anyone to get some importance, seek attention and be liked by others. They play a good role of being mediator between two groups and being ‘highly informative’. The gossip mongers are in a different league altogether. They can’t stand good performers who are admired by leaders. They envy others and rally people around their view to garner support. The level at which they gossip provokes people and is unpleasant. Their souls main existence depends on being ‘Untrustworthy’.They are everywhere or will come from anywhere like a swarm of ants on a random sugar block. No matter how much you want to run away from them, you will be chased by them using their charm and personal connections. But running away does not solve this problem. You need to have the backbone to tell things off the very first time so you wouldn’t help breed that culture. Gossip listeners are bigger culpritsGossip doesn’t work without a willing listener, so agreeing to listen is really as contributory as speaking it. Team members who refuse to listen will kill gossiping as effectively as no speakers. The authors agree with me in observing that candor and authentic expression of feelings and facts are more effective in communication and maintaining the health of the organisation.The only way to really clean up gossiping is to reveal the gossiper and the listener to each other, to the person about whom they have been gossiping, and to clearly delineate the relevant business facts from the ‘stories’. People who refuse to change need to be removed from the team before they destroy the entire team and business.Such leaders are half breed leaders, lack experience and confidence. They are vague in their reading of issues and feel insecure. They are neither analytical nor logical. They try to paint a picture that ‘ I know what is happening’ and that’s their only survival. As yourself “Does gossiping honour my own personal values?”. As a business leader, you want your employees to be as self-sufficient as possible. After all, you’re their supervisor or manager – not their mother or father. Keep in mind that reacting to every worker complaint may actually heighten the drama and make the situation worse. Doing so could even cause some employees to think you’re playing favorites. The truth in HRThe truth is, in Human Resources, there is no such thing as “talking off of the record.” We may feel, as leaders, that we have some element of trust which is good but only when it’s used for positive intentions. “Off the record” insinuates a negative connotation to me; it screams “gossip is coming; will you engage in this conversation with me? Much is to be gained by turning down the opportunity to gossip while at work–and it’s not as hard as you might think. With conscious effort and conviction, you can do your part to derail the harmful effects of destructive gossip and keep the work environment healthy and happy for all.Nip it in the bud Unfortunately, some situations won’t work themselves out on their own and you’ll be forced to step in. If ignored, employee disputes can infect the entire workplace and eventually taint the reputation of your company. Other employees may find themselves unintentionally drawn into the conflict. This “employee sideshow” can further derail productivity.Get to the root of the problem and stop the landslide before it starts. Make sure the message is clear that all employees, regardless of position and tenure, will be held accountable for their behaviour. Let them know that if established standards aren’t met, it could lead to disciplinary action.Have clear performance goals and measurement criteria and make them transparent. Incorporate peer and supervisor feedback into the measurement criteria. Agree on a set of organisational values and make them live within the organisation.Cost of gossiping and job jealousy cannot be recovered from the customers. Do an audit – go down the memory lane and capture the situations where gossip did cost the company money in terms of waste of time and negative impact of collective decision making and execution at the right speed.You can never bring the hearts and minds together of all people to work as siblings but you can take steps to minimise significant business value loss as a result. "
25 February 2018,Salient features of new Foreign Exchange Act,"Sri Lanka’s new Foreign Exchange Act came into effect last year after the Parliament passed it with amendments.The new law removed criminalisation of violations of the exchange control act and associated prison sentences. New Act covers matters including classes of capital transactions, opening and maintenance of accounts, permitted investments and granting of loans and advances.It also has provisions about capital transactions undertaken outside Sri Lanka by persons resident in Sri Lanka and capital transactions undertaken in Sri Lanka by persons resident outside Sri Lanka.The regulations under the said Act have been published by Gazette No 2045/56 issued on 17th November 2017.In an interview with the product head of Frontier Research, Travis Gomez explained the salient features of the new Forex Act.What is government’s intention with regard to the new Forex Act?This represents a shift in the policy direction from one of restricting foreign exchange movement to one that is facilitating exchange rate movementThe change in the name from Exchange Control to Exchange Management emphasizes this pointThis goes in line with some of the other policy changes the Government has been making such as the new Inland Revenue Act, changes to the immigration and emigration laws.The shift is towards a more rules based approach, which has greater transparency and less political discretionWhat are some of the broad features of the new Act?Greater clarity with regard to some of the definitions.Ex: Who counts as a resident and who is eligible for opening up the different types of accountsReducing the complexity and simplification. The Act clubs 18 different accounts into five main accounts.Greater competition and discretion for banks. The banks would have more discretion in the approval of forex transactions.This is done with the intention of streamlining and speeding up the approval process. The Act also opens up the market for greater competition as licensed brokers can open up certain accounts as well.What are the implications of the Act for the broad economy?The act signals a more open approach to forex which could encourage a greater flow of FDI’s in to the country The Act broadens the type of investment opportunities non-residents can participate in.Apart from the typical stock and bond investments, foreigners can also invest in unit trusts, and fixed deposits in banks.Of particular interest is the fact that the Act states that non-residents can invest in immovable property i.e: Real estateThe Act also allows banks to provide loans in LKR or USD terms to non-residents for the purpose of constructing and buying real estate.This would be a positive development for the real estate sector, as given the level of activity ongoing in the sector, foreign investor participation can absorb some of the new capacity that is rapidly coming on line.At a firm level, what are the implications of the Act?The Act extends the limits to which companies can invest. The limit for listed companies has been increased from USD 500,000 per year to USD 2 mn per year. Firms also have the opportunity to invest in sovereign bonds and Unit Trusts abroad. The limits for individuals has also been increased from USD 100,000 (life time investment) to USD 200,000.This would be an opportunity for firms in Sri Lanka and individuals to diversify their risk by investing abroadFor an individual, what are the implications of the Act?The limits on how much Sri Lankan rupees and foreign currency that can be taken in and out of the country has been changed. You can take up to Rs. 20,000 or up to USD 15,000 in foreign exchange without having to declare it.With regard to migration transfers, the Act has increased the initial amount as well as the annual amount you can take as forex when migrating. The annual migration allowance has been increased to USD 30,000 per yearIn addition, any pension payments, dividend income etc. would not be subject to the above limit.Overall, there has been a reduction in the restrictions imposed on individuals.- Courtesy: Frontier Research"

Clean growth is the core decarbonisation strategy.Supporting clean transport, energy transition and greener buildings together with green financing are areas of discussion we are having with the Government and businesses. Business leaders also have a role to play in delivering on climate action.I continue to encourage you to embrace and include energy efficiency and sustainable business practices as a key deliverable in your strategic business plans.

They were handed over to Sri Lanka during a reception where President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and High Commissioner of India Dr. Gopal Baglay participated in an event that ‘reflects on the prevailing bonds of neighbourly ties and goodwill between both countries’.“President Rajapaksa a few days ago personally called upon the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to send a stock of the vaccines to Sri Lanka for use among frontline health workers.In a generous move, the Indian government under its ‘neighbours first’ policy responded to President Gotabaya’s request and went to the extent of purchasing the 500,000 stock through India’s main laboratory before it was sent free of charge to Colombo by an Air India flight A1 281 on Thursday morning,” Sri Lanka Army media said in a statement.The samples were handed over to State Minister of Primary Health Care, Epidemics and Covid-19 Disease Control Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle.“The Covishield vaccine injected in two doses on a person will be first used at the Colombo National Hospital, Ragama Hospital and six other hospitals, including the Colombo Army Hospital and the Panagoda Army Hospital.Thereafter, it will be taken to other areas and all Army Hospitals as planned. In fact, we had a few rounds of rehearsals for transport, storing, inoculation and other measures.“This vaccine is restricted only to those whose names have already been listed and the entire program will remain very transparent. Countries, such as Russia and China too have offered to send us the vaccines as a goodwill move in response to the President’s request in addition to what has been offered by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the coming weeks,” Head of National Operations Centre for Prevention of Covid-19 Outbreak (NOCPCO) Army Commander Shavendra Silva said.The Sri Lanka Army will transport the vaccines to prioritised areas as recommended by the Presidential Task Force, since they have to be stored under specific temperature. The first storage will take place at the Epidemiology Unit freezers before they are distributed among frontline health workers, Army, Navy and Air Force personnel and police.Soon after the consignment was unloaded at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) steps were taken to transport it to the air cargo warehouse. The consignment was later transported to the main warehouse of the Ministry of Health in Colombo in several trucks with special cold storage facilities.Officials said 150,000 health workers and 120,000 selected military and police personnel will be the first to be inoculated at six hospitals in Colombo and its suburbs.Advisor to the President Lalith Weeratunga said two or three million doses of the vaccine will also be purchased from India.“The State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC) will place an order within the next two days with the Serum Institute for three million doses because there is a huge competition for the vaccine in the world.There is also no point in purchasing large quantities of the vaccine and storing it here because the vaccine has a lifespan of around six months. We must be prepared to provide the vaccine to the public as soon as it is brought down,” Weeratunga told a press conference.On Thursday, Sri Lanka recorded the highest number of Covid-19 patients in which 852 were from the Peliyagoda cluster and the remaining were 40 overseas returnees.Government Information Department sources said that, the death toll from the virus had reached 297 and the number of cases were 61,586.Sri Lanka was ranked 10 in a performance index of 98 countries for their handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, said a report compiled by the Sydney-based Lowy Institute on Thursday. New Zealand was ranked 1st.This Covishield Vaccine is a product of the Serum Institute of India (SII) and approved for restricted use in emergency situations for individuals 18 years and above.It is a recombinant non-replicating viral vector vaccine. Replication defective, safe adenovirus type used as a platform to deliver the glycoprotein (encoding SARS-CoV-2 Spike S) that trigger an immune response in the body against the Covid-19 Virus.The duration of protection is still not specified. The vaccine is stored at +20C to +8 0C (needs to be protected from freeze and direct sunlight), ready to use liquid non-preservative, multi-dose vaccine of 5ml (10 doses). Shelf-life around is around six months on production and expiry date is available on the product label.A dose of 0.5 ml of the Covishield vaccine should be administered by intramuscular route (IM) in to the upper arm preferably on the left side. The second dose should be planned within one month. Those who receive the first dose should complete the second dose for protection from the virus. FAQs from the Ministry of HealthWhat is the vaccination? It is a simple, safe and effective way of protecting people from harmful diseases by using the body’s natural defences to build resistance to specific infections and make the immune system stronger.Why do we need a vaccine against Covid-19? Vaccination is important in preventing illness and disease. Sri Lanka has a long and very successful history of disease control and prevention with vaccinations. Covid-19 preventive behaviour are extremely important, but disease control with behaviour alone has been difficult to achieve. A vaccine together with preventive behaviour may be the only possible exit from this pandemic.How are Covid-19 vaccines developed and tested? Every vaccine must go through extensive and rigorous testing to ensure it is safe before it can be administered. An experimental vaccine needs to undergo animal testing, human pre-clinical testing, and population phase I, II, and II clinical trials before it is sent to the market. During these phases the safety and effectiveness are assessed.What is in the Covid-19 vaccine? Most vaccines consist mainly of antigen, adjuvants, preservatives and stabilisers. In the Covid-19 vaccine the antigen trains our bodies to recognize it and fight it if there is a reoccurrence.How does the Covid-19 vaccine work? The vaccine carries a non-living part of the virus (a protein found on the surface of the virus) which is used to build resistance to the virus, using our body’s natural defences. Strong immune responses and memory is developed by special immune cells named B and T cells. If the person is infected later on by the virus, these cells remember the virus and attack it.Why is it important to get the Covid-19 vaccine? The Covid-19 virus is highly infectious and spreads quickly -can cause serious illness, hospitalisation, long term complications and even death. Getting your vaccine should protect you and may help protect your family and those around you. Being in good health does not reduce your risk of being infected with the Covid-19 and later passing it on. You can unknowingly infect your loved ones and those around you even if you have shown no symptoms at all. By getting vaccinated we are helping protect ourselves, society and being socially responsibleIs the Covid-19 vaccine safe? As with all vaccines, Covid-19 vaccine also needs to meet rigorous criteria for safety and effectiveness. All vaccines go through rigorous studies to ensure they are safe before being approved for use.With Covid-19 becoming a global health emergency, scientists around the world were working very hard to get vaccines out as soon as possible.Vaccine safety was the most important factor in the process of vaccine development. Evaluations of different vaccines were done very fast. No short cuts have been taken. Proper clinical trials have been conducted. Vaccines developed with huge commitment, sufficient funds and a large team of capable people working to achieve a common goal."
14 February 2021,Employee egos at the expense of business results,"Trust is a critical component of all high-performing organisations. When trust is high among employees, organisations are able to face the brutal facts of their company’s reality in an open manner. Solutions to complex problems are found. When co-workers don’t trust each other or feel they are under personal attack, the process of problem-solving breaks down. It takes time to build trust. It can be destroyed quickly, and can never be completely restored. The cost of such an attitude and behaviour of employees is huge though there is no perfect science to calculate it. Why do some employees behave in such a negative manner? How come some employees become larger than his or her job and play politics?. They are insecure. Perhaps they are mediocre performers who look for ways to build relationships with the top to take advantage. Their mindset tells them the way to advance at their company is at the expense of others. They may be jealous of those who are advancing more rapidly than they are, and rather than improve their own personal performance, they try to drag others down to try and prove that they are better than others. They don’t take personal responsibility if things don’t go well, and they blame others for their own failures. People with ego failIn my experience, these types of people eventually fail. The organisation will raise its defense mechanisms and ensure that they are not successful playing their political game. Those pursuing a personal agenda to the detriment of others, can instead take a path that will help you succeed.Pursue a personal agenda that is supportive of your co-workers. When you are supportive of them, they will be supportive of you. When you take the mantle of leadership on a specific issue, they will follow you and support your efforts. Much of the work within organisations gets done by the informal organisation.Become part of that informal organisation, which will help you get things done. You might find an effective way to deal with an individual playing the game of negative politics. Depending on the circumstances and the relative balance of political capital, you may decide to challenge the individual and put them on notice that they have more to lose than you if they continue.Gossip cultureLeaders need to play a crucial role in nurturing an effective organization. On occasion, a leader may reach a conclusion or make a decision based on input from a single person, and not talk to all individuals involved, and therefore fail to get a complete picture of the situation. A person speaking negatively about others may be attempting to advance their personal agenda. Leaders can listen to complaints, but shouldn’t take sides until they speak with all parties. You can then make an informed judgment and decision – with all the information in hand.If someone brings gossip to you, don’t complain that people promote gossip, but instead ask yourself why people come to you with gossip? People will come to you with gossip only if you entertain gossip. So ask yourself what’s wrong with you.Respect each otherIt would be wonderful if everyone was honest to each other, respected each other, nice to each other and had overall company success as the best interest at heart. But the reality is, many people are out for themselves.Sometimes, it is a personality issue, and sometimes it is the way the corporate structure is set up and the behavior has been tolerated in the past. You have to be above all the petty behaviour.Although difficult, it is critical for your future to learn how to deal with these types of behaviour by certain people. All these types of behaviour come from ego – ego is built over a time based on individual backgrounds. While some ego is important and helpful, having an inflated ego without substance with evil intention can hurt you and your business. Have you ever gone to a meeting and not had a shared goal to make the business win or the same goal as the person leading the meeting? If you have not, you are an exception.Why is it that we sit in meetings all the time and know that we have a different goal but do not think that others have different goals when we are leading meetings? Hidden agendas can kill an idea, and if we are not aware, these agendas come out of nowhere and we are not prepared to deal with them – and to battle it out for a common objective. Every person is motivated by something different. It is important to remember that when keeping your goal on top of your mind.What do we do with all this? It is a big issue in many companies today. But if your goal is to have an executive edge and lead and succeed, you have to see the big picture and realise that a leader is only a leader when there are followers. When reviewing the performance of your direct reports, be sure to collect data on the degree to which they are trusted by their co-workers, in addition to the results that they accomplish.Employees who are not trustworthy adversely impact the effectiveness of your organisation and you will eventually part company with them. And remember – always listen to both sides before reaching a conclusion or making a decision. It will make you a more effective leader, and help improve the performance of your company.Distinguish between good employees and bad – treat them based on merits. Make performance the single criteria for reward and recognition – that’s the only formula for business success. "
7 March 2021,Lankan SMEs enter new markets ,"A large number of Sri Lankan Small and Medium sector enterprises (SMEs) have  entered around 16 markets  following the completion of the EU-funded  four-year “EU-Sri Lanka Trade Related Assistance” project co-implemented by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the International Trade Centre (ITC) in partnership with the Department of Commerce (DoC). UNIDO Chief Technical Advisor Jairo Andrés Villamil-Diaz  said a significant portion of the SMEs which were supported have entered markets in Germany, Greece, UK, New Zealand, France, Poland, Canada, Japan, the Maldives, South Korea, Australia, Dubai, China, USA, Peru and Mexico.UNIDO in the framework of the EU-funded project supported over 100 Sri Lankan SMEs to be geared for the export market. The country specific ‘Export Compliance Program (XCP) program was prepared by UNIDO. The technical assistance given within UNIDO’s XCP and the financial support of the European Union, resulted in over 30 certified SMEs adding 50 different international certifications.  UNIDO has run a comprehensive diagnostic for each SME, identifying improvement opportunities and providing detailed actionable recommendations. The reports cover all aspects of their business such as quality, food safety, packaging, labelling, marketing, branding, corporate governance, strategic planning, management, sales, human resources, financial administration, business operations, environment and sustainability. “Over  6,000 people were trained and over 60 action plans were developed and over Rs. 215 million was invested by SMEs to improve factories, production and services,” Villamil-Diaz  said.The overview or summary is that with a comprehensive and holistic support (such as the one given by UNIDO with the financial assistance of the EU), Sri Lankan SMEs can successfully enter new markets, become more competitive, create value-addition for their products and services, and improve the quality of life of workers, customers and business stakeholders.The EU-Sri Lanka Trade-Related Assistance project helped Sri Lanka to directly empower and to create a trade enabling environment for SMEs to make the most of potential opportunities resulting from the EU’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+).The project facilitated capacity building of entrepreneurs, particularly women and youth, in terms of mandatory (regulatory) and voluntary (standards) compliance for select value chains, namely for spices and concentrates and processed food and beverages (SCPFB) and information technology (IT), business process outsourcing (BPO).To strengthen undergirding trade capacities that facilitate market access, such as modernising national quality infrastructure (NQI) services, the project worked in lockstep with   institutions to enhance service provision to the aforementioned sectors.  UNIDO Representative for Sri Lanka, Rene van Berkel said UNIDO applauds the Government’s comprehensive modernisation of its compliance system and its institutions for SPS and quality control. This is decisively critical for a quality-led export growth, which can unlock exports to the value of Rs. 655 billion and 3.1 percent GDP growth over the next decade compared against a scenario with no reform.An exemplary achievement is the prospective Geographical Indication (GI) registration of Ceylon Cinnamon – Sri Lanka’s first-ever GI product, which is anticipated to receive protection in the EU. From setting up the legal framework to ensuring readiness in procedures and documents to launching an ICT-based traceability system and training stakeholders, Sri Lanka is now poised to benefit from the Ceylon brand value in the world cinnamon market.” "
19 September 2021,Asia-Pacific Target Network conference concludes,"The Asia Pacific Target Network Conference themed ‘Consolidate Elastic Target Network, Unlocking New Digital Value’ was conducted online recently.Around 500 professionals of government agencies, standards organizations, enterprises, carriers, and industry mainstream vendors attended this conference. At this conference, Huawei worked with leading regional operators such as PLDT, Telkom Indonesia, Globe and CMI, to discuss the intelligent target network architecture and highlight the value of the transport network. On the first day of the conference, President of Network Marketing and Solution Sales Department at Huawei, Gary Lu delivered the keynote speech on ‘Network 2025, Enabling Business Success’. He called on the ICT industry to work closely to enable future deterministic business success through Network 2025.According to a third party survey, 68% of business leaders take “economic uncertainty” as the biggest risk. The ICT industry is also facing the challenges of uncertainty. Networks are impacted by the pandemic. Network traffic, traffic direction and service requirements are more difficult to predict. The uncertainty of business and network directly raises two questions: “What business should I invest in?” and “Where is the most valuable place should I invest first?”“Fortunately, we have seen joint efforts by governments, industry organizations, and carriers around the world to cope with the future uncertainty by leveraging the certainty of ICT development,” said Lu. “Network 2025 precisely links network planning, network investment, service development and business success. Facing the uncertainties, let’s work closely to achieve future deterministic business success through Network 2025,” said  Lu. "
29 March 2020,"Presentation skill, an inevitable part of sales success","Presentation skill, in other words, the ability to maintain attention and achieve your desired outcome from presenting to the opposite person or a group of people, is an important soft skill a person must learn.This is one of the most important tools to communicate in business. Once learnt, this skill can effectively be used in many professional and personal endeavours whether it is a customer presentation, job interview, business meeting or in a personal engagement such as a speech at a private function or a religious event. An effective presentation consists of a meaningful, inspirational, creative and memorable message that will bring definite results in business and in life.My intention is to discuss a presentation in a selling situation. The most important commercial circumstance in this regard is that of a presentation made to a customer. This act can vary from a face to face individual presentation to an address to a large gathering with a video  or slide presentation.Effective presentation in all forms of advertising is a crucial factor for business entities. Delivering a clear, concise and easy to understand message is the key to success. Whether the message is verbal, written or imagery, its contents must be understood by the audience clearly and precisely.Prior to a customer sales presentation, it is best to do brief research about the customer profile. Preceding knowledge about the customer’s business lines, policies, success stories (certainly not failures, as no customer will discuss failures with a stranger) and product lines would be a distinct advantage against a competitor. A customer benefit plan (customers always buy the benefit, not the product itself) will also be extremely useful along with a properly developed sales presentation.A successful individual presentation always practically commences with your first approach to the customer. There are no second chances when it comes to making first impressions, so it’s best to get it right the first time. It is said that the first impressions are the most lasting. Therefore, enter the meeting confidently with a proper greeting, a firm handshake (only if your customer offers the hand), waiting to be invited to sit or asking permission to sit and finally your posture while seated are the key elements of the first approach.However, if it is a group presentation to a small or large audience, the presenter should adapt a different initial approach somewhat similar to a public speech. Let me give you a few tips. Arrive early at the location to adjust yourself to the surroundings. This will make you settle down before the presentation and help dispel the usual nervousness before speaking to an audience. Positive thoughts of visualising an effective and entertaining audience response can give you an incredible amount of confidence.Walking at a brisk pace and greeting the audience with a suitably loud and confident voice will not only attract the attention of the audience but also establish your credibility in the first few seconds which is of absolute importance.The presenter has to understand that most audiences want to see the speaker succeed and they are not there to laugh at, unless the presenter makes a serious blunder in the all important first few seconds. Even if a mistake is made, the presenter must learn to carry on with confidence after making corrections.A cheerful attitude with a smile on the face makes an enormous impact in a group presentation. Your attitude at the beginning can place the audience at ease before the presentation starts, a goal that you must have in your mind. This practice alone is a valuable criterion, often more effective for customer decision making than a complex product feature. Actively engaging the audience during the presentation also is essential and result oriented as people love to talk and express their opinions.Delivering the prepared presentation convincingly needs data and facts, descriptions and personal experience on the topic. In personal and group presentations, the presenter must understand that if the subject matter is technical or heavily descriptive, the listeners may quickly become bored and uninterested. Therefore, the presenter must not try to cover too much material too fast. Pace out and be entertaining to the audience to drive out monotony.Being animated is a sure way of drawing the interest of the individual or group audience. It demonstrates enthusiasm which any person accepts as a sign of a positive attitude. To use the voice effectively, presenters practice voice modulation techniques to vary the impact of the message. Your body language during the appearance gives additional strength to the product, service or concept. Voice and body language with proper animation are strong elements of a presentation.Engaging a physical demonstration through a white board or a flipchart, even in this modern day, can be extremely practical. Along with the verbal explanations, with or without slides, writing down facts, figures and information can give a boost to the presentation. This practice helps the customer to make the buying decision.Finally, it is of paramount importance to believe in the product or service you are presenting. This belief makes your points tremendously strong in the eyes of the audience. Without getting excited by the contents of your subject, you cannot expect to get the audience to become motivated enough.A good presentation is an absolutely certain way of knowing that the desired result is guaranteed. In my long experience in selling, as a seller and a buyer, I have seen salesmen fail due to poor presentation of facts. I also have witnessed expensive campaigns fail due to weak and arbitrary presentations. The reason is that they are not aware of the necessity of presentation techniques. Learning the art of making presentations can help close business deals, win job interviews and make successful public appearances. Presentation skills not only help self promotion but is also important for career, business and life."
24 September 2017,e-Commerce experts at Asian Business Angel Forum,"Organisers of Sri Lanka’s first Asian Business Angel Forum (ABAF) recently held a preview event, ahead of the main conference on October 11-12. Entitled ‘Tete a tete with Startups in Sri Lanka’, this opportunity to learn about building great start-ups took place on September 15, at the Kingsbury hotel, where a number of speakers addressed the pressing issues of an audience made up of mostly of young entrepreneurs.Giving advice at the workshop, on areas as diverse as growing across borders, when and how to scale up companies, valuation and funding options, as well as even tips on hiring staff, maintaining finances, most advantageous transport and marketing alternatives, and fixing common mistakes by start-ups, were three veteran entrepreneurs and e-commerce executives, Mekin Maheshwari, Amit Banda and Ramesh Shah.Maheshwari, an early employee at Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart, who climbed the ranks to become the company’s Chief People Officer before leaving the company in 2015, indicated that e-commerce companies were not always focused on creating assets, as was the case with more traditional companies.Rather their main goal was to grow customer volumes, with the company’s valuation and profitability only becoming a concern later on.Banda, a former senior executive at both Reliance Communications and The Future Group, revealed that when Amazon was developing its Kindle online book reader, the team in charge of book sales at the company was worried that it could kill the market for paperbacks.But they eventually decided to go ahead, because otherwise someone else would have beat them to market. This created a wholly new revenues stream for Amazon.Today, the reverse was coming into effect, where even though many people now bought books online, some e-commerce companies had identified omni-channel strategies to differentiate themselves, and opened up brick and mortar stores to adapt to different channels and their customers’ behaviour.Shah, the founder of the RK Group, a US$ 450 million-in-revenues textiles and e-commerce firm, said no matter what strategy one took for entry into India, China played a big part.This was because China had fine-tuned shipping to a great degree, so much so that delivering of any small package from China to any part of India cost only INR 100 (approximately Rs. 238.40).This meant that whoever wanted to compete in India had to always factor in this low shipping cost.A part of ABAF 2017, the half-day ‘Tete a tete with Startups in Sri Lanka’ workshop comprised over 50 participants from about 40 companies, both start-ups and growing concerns. This diverse group represented sectors as varied as e-commerce, manufacturing, apparel, transportation, jewellery, marketing, data sciences, and technology.ABAF 2017 has already gathered significant momentum in recent days, with more than 50 prominent foreign delegates having confirmed their participation to date.ABAF 2017 will welcome attendees from over 20 countries including Sri Lanka, USA, UK, Australia, Hong Kong, China, Korea, Israel, Dubai, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mauritius, Netherlands, Japan, France and Germany.ABAF has also attracted interest from internationally renowned institutions such as the TVS Group, Proparco France, KfW Germany, DEG Germany, DGGF Netherlands, FMO Netherlands, Citibank Hong Kong, Blume Ventures india, Jungle Ventures Singapore, Gf in Mauritius, Cloudwell in Bangladesh, and Qlapa in Indonesia.This is in addition to ABAF’s impressive speaker line-up, which features Dr. Clarence Tan, former Ambassador for Singularity University; Dr. Yehoshua (Shuki) Gleitman, Chairman of GIBF (Guangzhuo Israel Biotech Fund); Dr. Samson Tam, Chairman of the Hong Kong Business Angel Network (HKBAN); Dr. Mark Hon, Chairman of Business Angel Network South East Asia (BANSEA); David Chen, Co-founder of AngelVest and Founding Chairman of Harvard Business School Alumni Angels of China; Brigitte Baumann Gervais, Founder and CEO of Go Beyond Early Stage Investing (Scotland); and Jayesh Parekh, Managing Partner at Jungle Ventures (Singapore). VP for SEA and India at Google, Rajan Anandan; President of the Indian Angel Network, Padmaja Ruparel; Member of the Investment Committee at Wadi Accelerator (New York), Pankaj Jain; Chairman of ABAF/Melbourne Angels, Jordan Green; and Partner at Aavishkaar Sanchayan, Chakraborty will also speak at the event.A detailed ABAF 2017 agenda and speaker line-up, as well as information on how to sign up for the conference, is available at www.abafsrilanka.com.Kicking off on October 11 at the Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel, ABAF this year will also encompass the sixth edition of Venture Engine, Sri Lanka’s trailblazing program for entrepreneurship acceleration and empowerment, which will be held on ABAF’s first day.As a result, Venture Engine participants will have an opportunity to directly access, via ABAF, investments, expertise, and mentoring offered by well-respected individuals in the field of global finance.A strategic partner for this year’s Venture Engine, the Lankan Angel Network is the host of ABAF 2017. The Lankan Angel Network is Sri Lanka’s pioneering Business Angel Network with over 75 member investors who have collectively invested over Rs. 2 billion in 25 local start-ups, while Venture Engine is a product of a 2012 collaboration between BOVCapital and the Indian Angel Network.Venture capital firm Aavishkaar serves as Venture Engine’s Platinum sponsor, while Orion City is the Silver sponsor and Dialog Axiata is the official telecommunications sponsor."
14 May 2021,Hong Kong freezes shares of media tycoon Lai,"HONK KONG, May 15. (Aljazeera) - Hong Kong authorities have frozen assets belonging to jailed media tycoon Jimmy Lai, including all shares in his company, Next Digital – the first time a listed firm has been targeted by national security laws in the financial hub.Also among assets targeted were the local bank accounts of three companies owned by Lai, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Security John Lee said in a government statement.The statement, issued after the market close on Friday, said Lee had issued notices “in writing to freeze all the shares of Next Digital Limited held by (Jimmy) Lai Chee-ying, and the property in the local bank accounts of three companies owned by him”.Lai was sentenced to 14 months in prison for taking part in unauthorised assemblies during pro-democracy protests in 2019.He faces three alleged charges under a sweeping new national security law imposed by Beijing, including collusion with a foreign country.The move against his assets was also made under the security law, which criminalises acts including subversion, sedition, collusion with foreign forces and secession with possible life imprisonment.The decision by the authorities to use the law’s powers for the first time to target a Hong Kong listed company could have repercussions for investor sentiment.There have been signs of capital flight since the law was imposed last June, to foreign countries including Canada, according to government agencies, bankers and lawyers.Beijing said it imposed the law on the former British colony to restore order after months of pro-democracy, anti-China protests in 2019.However, critics say the law has been used by China’s Communist leaders to suppress freedoms and pro-democracy campaigners – many of whom have been arrested and jailed, or have fled into exile.The chief executive officer of Next Digital, Cheung Kim-hung, told the Apple Daily that Lai’s frozen assets had nothing to do with the bank accounts of Next Digital, and that their operations and finances would not be affected.The firm’s employees pledged to continue to “uphold their duty and keep reporting”, in a statement posted on the Facebook page of Next Digital’s trade union.Under Hong Kong stock exchange filings, Lai is Next Digital’s major shareholder and holds 71.26 percent of shares that were worth approximately 350 million Hong Kong dollars (US$45m) based on Friday’s closing share price.The value of the other “property” assets frozen by the authorities was not immediately clear.Next Digital runs the Apple Daily, Hong Kong’s most influential pro-democracy newspaper that has long been a thorn in the side of Hong Kong and Chinese authorities.Senior Hong Kong officials have recently warned Apple Daily about its coverage and have spoken of the possible introduction of a “fake news” law. Critics have said this is all part of a continuing crackdown on the city’s media.The Taiwan arm of Apple Daily said on Friday it would stop publishing its print version, blaming declining advertising revenue and more difficult business conditions in Hong Kong linked to politics."
21 June 2020,Country needs dedicated  and visionary leaders - Biz leaders," As another General Election approaches with a host of promises to be made by candidates, business leaders in advance urge those who would steer the country’s future course, to shun bribery, corruption, misappropriation of public funds, waste and inefficiency, to be competitive in the global business arena and leapfrog in economic progress.They called upon the to-be policy makers to learn from the global pandemic which has opened the eyes of everyone to abhor all forms of discrimination, racial disharmony and promote goodwill, peace and harmony among communities and the environment.Colombo Stock Brokers Association Past President and Director/CEO, Candor Group of Companies, Ravi Abeysuriya said the country urgently needs a government that will eradicate  corruption, uphold the rule of law and make  long term policy decisions in the best interests of the country. Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, Past Chairman Kishu Gomes said this  election is more crucial than any of the previous elections as the economy was in shatters before Covid-19 hit the global economy creating  multiple economic challenges for Sri Lanka.“Our GDP growth had dropped to  approximately 3% for the past four years from the previous high of over 6% under the previous regime.“Now with the pandemic, export income has been paralysed with all export markets and revenue streams including tourism, apparel and expatriate worker remittances coming to a grinding halt.“The way out is for the country to reduce recurring expenses and increase revenue through the export of value-added goods and services and tourism while promoting FDIs with policy alignment, infrastructure development, investor-friendly labour regulations and streamlining the approval process.“Bribery, corruption, misappropriation of government funds of various forms, public sector waste due to inefficiency and bureaucracy have to be dealt with severely to be more competitive as an investment destination.“Local businesses should be encouraged to cross borders in the new normal world with more forward looking policies and committed support to enable exporters to be more competitive and explore new markets.“If we do not make these tough decisions soon the economy will soon hit a level where a turn around will not be possible for another decade.“At least this time, the voters need to select candidates who are educated, who would place the country before self, economy savy and understand how a sustainable economy can be built.“Campaigning has become an expensive business. So most candidates depend on monetary help from business organisations and rich entrepreneurs.“This is where the issue starts and this later leads to policy and regulatory deviations, bribery and corruption.No politician has a strong business base to invest his or her own money and survive on legitimate income unless their intention is to spend their own money for the sake of the poor people of the country. The question is do we have such politicians in the country anymore like 3-4 decades ago? Voters should be wise and make their choices based on the candidates education, intelligence, global exposure, past performance, transparency and values,” he said.Planters’ Association of Ceylon Past Chairman and Haleys Plantations  Managing Director Dr. Roshan Rajadurai said the tea industry which has sustained the economy for decades must be taken seriously and supported to expand its contribution to the local and national economy which needs a fresh boost.Marketing the Ceylon Tea brand with value addition is crucial to remain in the game and boost market share.Policy measures should be in place to enhance production and market them in new destinations in diverse forms taking into account the limitations at ground level.The potential is upstream and if value addition could be enhanced benefits will trickle down to the workers whose productivity  could thereby be increased.Tea smallholders who contribute around 70 percent of the production must be supported to build the supply chain and boost income. Executive Director, Kent Ridge (Pvt) Ltd., Janaka Kumarasinghe said the global pandemic has created a  level playing field. Sri Lanka should leapfrog to a higher level even without having advanced transportation systems and infrastructure by using information communication technology.“Our island should be a stepping stone to India and connect to the Silk route which can harness the potential of the two superpowers. It should also promote local industries and self-reliance.“We need a strong civil and diplomatic service supported by intellectuals to overcome challenges.Parliamentarians should introduce sound legislation, create a visionary mindset and develop intellectual capital  with the support of the Executive for Sri Lanka to be a force to be reckoned with in her strategic location in Asia’s century,” he said."

2 May 2021,Unleashing the power to lead: Global presence with a local pulse,"We were indeed delighted to present 396 extraordinary managers at the PIM’s latest convocation, held under challenging circumstances recently . Due to the sudden surge of Covid-19 cases, we had to adhere to strict health care guidelines in limiting the participation only to the graduands excluding the visitors.It was another milestone of developing leaders with global presence and local pulse. That is why we picked the apt theme this year as “unleashing the power to lead”.  Instead of cursing the darkness of leadership we see at many critical fronts, we decided to light not one candle but many. Today’s column is all about this prestigious event of the premier postgraduate enterprise that aptly acclaimed as the “Nation’s Management Mentor”.OverviewAs we are much aware, leadership is all about inspiring, influencing and initiating. It is more than positions and titles as it involves decisions and actions. We have been breeding leaders to the nation for over thirty-five years. These thoroughbred professionals have mastered value creation with confidence and competence. They are equipped with cutting-edge knowledge and complementary skills needed to perform in both private and public sectors alike. In producing them with clarity and commitment, the PIM has always been a centre of excellence in management education with its wings spreading beyond Sri Lanka.Excellence is all about being exceptionally good. When applied to enterprises, it involves exceptional achievements in a consistent manner. That’s what the PIM is proud of as a self-financed and semi-autonomous public entity.  We simply excel with extraordinary executives in essentially engaging them to unleash their true potential. The nation expects them to contribute towards the socio-economic upliftment in multiple fronts.As our mission proclaims, we ignite human imagination by developing leaders with global presence and local pulse.  In this endeavour, we pursue innovative teaching, cutting-edge research, enriching partnerships, inspiring sustainability and exemplary governance.  Now the time has come to expand our reach, regionally and globally in adhering to best practices with appropriate use of technology. The PIM will continue to produce value in practicing values, as the nation’s management mentor.Keynote speakerDeepal Sooriyaarachchi, a prestigious alumnus of PIM, and now serving as a member of the Board of Management of PIM, was the keynote speaker of the PIM’s annual convocation this year.We were fortunate to have him as a  much-respected corporate personality with over four decades of wide industry experience, and out of that more than 15 years at board level. He proudly claims he started his career as a sales clerk. He is a Fellow member of the Chartered Institute of Marketing UK, Fellow Member of the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing, and holds an MBA from PIM. He is also an Alumni of National University of Singapore, Asian Institute of Management, and the Stanford Business School USA.Sooriyaarachchi pioneered in disseminating management knowledge in Sinhala through his book series ‘Sinhalen Business’ and many print and electronic media interventions. As a prolific writer he has authored over 15 books in Sinhala and in English, published  locally and internationally on a wide range of subjects from business to philosophy. A leading Management Development Consultant, Author, Accredited Master Coach and Master Mentor, Deepal  has conducted more than 1000 various programmes in over 12 countries across all five continents. He holds several leadership positions as an independent non-executive director and also engages in consultancies local and overseas.Highlights of the addressI felt Sooriyaarachchi’s speech was timely and topical. His main focus was to highlight how unleashing the power to lead becomes relevant in the current business context, with emphasis on “mastery”. He brought a wide array of points to ponder in order to ascertain the rigour and relevance associated with true mastery. I thought of sharing some extracts from his speech. Sooriyaarachchi began by connecting to his MBA studies at PIM. “I am indeed grateful and honoured to stand in front of you almost after two decades, since I was where you are today”.I recall with gratitude all those who guided and supported me in my MBA journey. If not for them I would not have been here today… One of the most powerful lessons I learnt having done the MBA is  that there are hardly any individual achievements. Let me illustrate that with a small incident.“I got married while doing the MBA. A few months after marriage I had to take my wife to a doctor. The doctor’s appointment  was clashing with a lecture at the PIM. If I skipped that class, I would have missed the required attendance resulting in repeating the subject. It was Prof. Tilak Fonseka’s class, and he meant business; excuses were difficult to come by. On the other hand, my wife’s condition meant that she saw the doctor on that very day.“Finally, I asked one of my colleagues to take her to the doctor. My wife very kindly agreed to go to the doctor with him. I somehow scooted out during the tea break and made it to Navaloka just in time to see the doctor with my wife and released my friend. This was only one instance that goes to prove that my life and what I call my success is not only mine, but so many have contributed to all of these achievements. This realisation alone is worth the entire MBA process. It makes me very humble”.Master“As the PIM’s advertising slogan suggests, from today onwards you are called an MBA or an MPA” elaborated Deepal. “In other words, a Master In Business Administration or a Master in Public Administration. Historically a man who has people working for him, especially servants or slaves was called a master. ““On the other hand, you are supposed to have acquired a great degree of skill or proficiency in a particular function or a discipline. Though the first definition may be true in some instances what is most relevant is the second definition.To be a master of business management or public management. With mastering the craft of managing business you unleash the potential that is within you to lead teams, organisations and eventually the nation. So, I wish to explore the concept of Mastering! In business what do we really manage?”“However complex the business or the organisation is, all what we do is   managing People, Processes and Policies. All organisational activities can be classified under these three topics.After studying so much about business and so many theories and models perhaps you may not like me taking such a simple view about a business organisation. In managing these three areas all what managers do are making yes or no decisions and executing them.”“A decision is selecting an option from among two or more, based either on past experiences or on assumptions about the future.  However complex the decision-making process you follow, eventually a manager’s decision got to be a yes or no. When making decisions we always think that it is the right decision.“Whether it is right or wrong can be determined only in the future. Ideally the best decisions are those that are right by the enterprise. Managers or leaders fail to make such decisions when they are conditioned or influenced by four types of biases or extremes. These are called ‘sathara agathi’. I wish to explore these biases or agati s we should try to avoid when making decisions so that we can improve the quality of decisions. “Strong attachment“The first bias or the agati is canda or chanda. This means strong attachment, liking or preference. When the decision maker has a strong preference or an attachment towards an option then it prevents seeing any negatives. A decision taken giving priority to self-interest rather than that of the enterprise is definitely a result of this bias. When a manager identifies strongly    with a particular option then also the decision can be flawed, for he or she fails or refuses to see any negatives thereof.”“The second Agati   is called dvesha- or extreme dislike. This can manifest as angry reactions to dislikes in various forms. When such dislikes exist, they also prevent us from making unbiased decisions. They really blur the view.”“The third agati is called bhaya - or fear. Fear can range from fear that comes within due to uncertainty or fear to fail as well as due to various external forces that can cause pressures on the decision maker. This is called decisions made under duress. Such decisions in most instances are not right; that is why they are not accepted as valid even legally.”“The fourth and the final agati  is called moha or ignorance. This can also be defined as a lack of required information or basing the decision on mis-information. For instance, in Japanese management, they use a concept called Gemba and Gembatsu to reduce the error due to Moha- that is by observing the actual occurrence at the actual place. ““If we can avoid these biases or agati’s to a great extent we can make better decisions.”“The second part and to me the most important part of a decision is execution or implementing the decision. Unless you give your full attention,  focus and commitment to the process of execution, there is no guarantee that the expected results can be achieved. Managers make seemingly good decisions, but often they fail to execute or implement them wholeheartedly.”“After making the decision we tend to  identify ourselves with the decision thinking that “this is my decision”. The moment we identify ourselves with a decision we bring our own Ego into the equation. Then we do not want to change the decision even if the circumstances change. But if a manager has  the right attitude about making decisions, that is considering them as actions taken at a certain point in time under certain conditions with a certain set of information and assumptions, but  when subsequently realise that they are not valid anymore. then such a smart manager is bold enough to change the decision. “Way forwardAs Aristotle said, the roots of education are bitter but the fruits are sweet. The convocation day was a time of tasting that sweetness. A premier postgraduate program should have high quality and relevance.  That’s what we at PIM are continuously striving for.I earnestly hope that the 396 private sector managers and the public sector administrators who graduated will contribute their utmost towards the betterment of themselves, their respective organisations, and the nation at large. That is how we unleash the power of leadership in breeding holistic leaders fulfilling a dire need."
19 May 2019,"‘Brand building, important to remain competitive’","Sri Lanka needs more entrepreneurs to facilitate the country’s forward march in terms of socio-economic development.Young entrepreneur Diluni Jayasekera who has excelled in her chosen field, has made many strides in her career of over half a decade. Among her achievements were an international award - the ‘Pioneering Woman Leader’ award, at the sixth World Women Leadership Congress and Awards ceremony in Mumbai, India, in February.“This is an international recognition, and I personally consider this as an achievement because it also highlights the company which I am involved with. This is a major boost for my career. As a company, we are involved in brand-building and our efforts are further encouraged by this award,” Jayasekera said in an interview with Business Observer.However, she said that pumping money alone into advertising will not help, and brand building is important to remain competitive.“We are in the process of improving our digital arm, as we want to deliver results. We are known as a boutique agency and prefer to be called by that name. We offer specialised, customised service and are not interested in creating a mass client base but quality service delivery,” she said.Excerpts:Q. What does winning this award mean to you?A. Personally, it means that I am on the right track and following my heart does work, that doing what I love, what I am passionate about... it works. Professionally, it means, along with my team, I can keep creating positive change, and grow.Having put my heart and soul into my work at Brand Centrical, and to know that I have been rewarded by those in the Business Women’s Network, means the world to me. It can be a very demanding role at times and to know that my hard work has been recognised by those outside of the business, in an international platform, is very flattering.Q. What motivates you?A. My business partner, Wimukthi Galahitiyawa and I, were in the advertising industry and with time and exposure, we realised that Sri Lankan businesses were more focused on selling services or products through short-lived advertising, which is communicating availability of the products or services. As a result, in Sri Lanka, we only have good hoardings or TV commercials - but no good brands with value.Merely focusing on advertising results not only in business stagnating, but we also stagnate as a country as well. That’s why we wanted to introduce branding in Sri Lanka and help businesses in the country go forward.Having started five years ago, with three people and one client in a small place, but with high hopes and positive vision, today, we are a fully functioning agency with 40 clients which include top corporates of the country. Over the years, we transformed business and received commendation and as a result built a loyal client base without any promotional work. This is the motivation to keep doing what I love.Q. What is your next target?A. Two years into the business, an internal digital arm was formed to provide a 360 degree solution to our growing clientele.It soon started to attract new clients due to the business oriented digital solutions provided by our company as compared to the traditional digital firms which only focused on technical know-how.The realisation of the potential of the company in combining, business intelligence with digital solutions, was understood when the first business software was developed from scratch, by the digital department of Brand Centrical.Since then, the company has identified areas where software solutions can be applied to achieve greater results in business for the clients, and it was market-tested with multiple successful software solutions.As I am more into marketing intelligence within the company, my aim is to provide innovative digital solutions for businesses to be more effective and successful.Q. How do you hope to achieve this target?A. A strategic business plan has been developed for this new expansion over the past couple of months. Thereafter, its important for me to set goals for direction and focus, and help me to stay motivated till the targets are achieved.It’s also important to celebrate successes each step of the way. After all, this is about the journey as much as the destination.Q. What can people do to make the country better?A. To have discipline. Discipline is a concept everyone is aware of, but few truly understand. Most Sri Lankans lack discipline and I believe that is the main reason why we, as a country, progress at a slow pace. For personal and professional growth, this quality is a must. The most successful people in life apply discipline on a daily basis. Discipline brings stability and structure into a person’s life. It shows a person to be responsible and respectful.The observance of well-defined rules is the basis of society. If there were no discipline, people would do whatever they want and make mistakes, without any consideration for others. It encourages good human behaviour to create a better society and make it a more enjoyable place for everyone. If every Sri Lankan understood this principle it would transform our country into a better place.Q. Is it hard to be a career woman in your field?A. It’s hard to be a career woman in any field. Not only in Sri Lanka but also in developed countries as well. This is a global issue that women face. Most men wouldn’t want to accept this, but it is so, We survive in a male- dominant world!Today, the percentage of working women has grown significantly compared to what it used to be. Women have gradually evolved from being limited to the kitchen, to running their own companies. However, when women start to climb the ladder and realise our place is no longer subservient to men, and that we should stand beside them and achieve the same career milestones as them, instead of being beneath them, that’s when it becomes difficult for us. I have experienced this in my career. Despite your qualifications your gender becomes an obstacle.Therefore, it’s important to believe in yourselves and try as hard as you can to be the best, in everything you do no matter what obstacles you might encounter, staying positive and being confident will make you overcome any hurdle.Also, as women, we should always support other women. After all, we are all in this together and together we could accomplish the unimaginable.Q. What is the best piece of advice you can give girls who aspire to be more like you?A. Draw inspiration from success stories of people, but write your own story. Everyone’s story is different. Trying to be more like someone will not work for you. Your story is different, write the best version of it.Q. Where do you see yourself in five years?A. I always try to be better and to do better each passing day. Personally, I want to be the best version of myself in five years time and make a positive impact on society.Professionally, there is a lot planned for the coming years. I am excited to achieve each goal along with my team to uplift our country to global standards and empower women. "
17 May 2020,Managing business through Covid-19: From global to a local economy,"While the priority is get back to normal life, the process is not easy and will be time consuming.This needs a national action plan for economic revival headed by a committee which should include the public and private sector with the armed services and police giving the strength and courage to resurrect our economy similar to what has been done to fight the pandemic.Global and local economy:All this time we were working on global policies which have now been disrupted. Imports and exports, global supply chains will be severely affected, foreign exchange scarcity will be severe and the exchange rate depreciation speeded up with many job losses and bankruptcies of business organisations.Everyone expects the Government to assist or bail them out and the response has been good in the short term with the concessions granted to business and society but not a solution for the future without studying the Sri Lankan economy and how we can work out a new national strategy to take the country forward and to find solutions to problems encountered.Already technology is playing a major role in communication, education and many other sectors. The lack of foreign exchange will mean that we may have to look at the policies we adopted prior to 1977 where local production and agriculture were priorities.However, this should be handled with care and caution with the new experiences we gained through the opening of the economy promoting exports, free availability of foreign exchange, foreign direct investment, excessive borrowings of the government, negative terms of trade, free trade agreements, free availability of raw materials, food stuffs and many others which will be greatly diminished or not available now.The gap in the continued balance of trade, the dependence on foreign employment income, major export of garments together with the major imports of fuel, foodstuffs, milk foods will have major impacts on the economy and society and needs to be vigorously pursued in framing the new strategies to transform the economy and look at local agriculture, and local industry as priorities to save the Nation.The Governor of the Central Bank has requested all exporters to bring in the export proceeds and halted all non-essential imports. These are all indications that we need to frame our new economic policies on a majority local economy. Local banks and finance companies too will have to play a major role in assisting local businesses in these difficult times and the Central Bank has already outlined certain packages and the ultimate result should be to enable them to tide over these difficulties and come back to normality.Priority for the agricultural sectorIf you consider the local economy then the priority has to be given to the agricultural sector as we cannot be without food and to avoid hunger. Hence a dynamic national project committee should be formed with the government machinery going to the agricultural areas and draw up the plans to maintain food security and to decide what crops should be grown to substitute for food items that were imported which can be grown in Sri Lanka.Many of the food items coming from India will not be available as they will need to feed their own people first. But all of them can be grown in Sri Lanka and we need to put the agricultural sector on a war-footing.Technology and knowledge information should also be used in this new drive for excellence in the agricultural sector. Government officers have to put their best foot forward and come with practical and workable plans and policies with district project committees coordinated by a strong and result oriented main National Project Committee which need to be action oriented. We should make use of experienced professionals, government servants, technical officers, armed services and police similar to the National Committee formed to fight the COVID 19 pandemic which is an example as to how the Government can be effective and productive to reform the local agricultural sector, the biggest asset we have. We need to achieve this goal of self sufficiency in food items and go back to the era of King Parakrama Bahu when we earned the distinction of being the Granary of the East. Foreign Exchange scarcityOn the foreign exchange usage the biggest import items are fuel and foodstuffs. Since these items are imported we need to earn the foreign exchange needed for imports. In the case of fuel, our transport, electricity generation and industry needs should be properly planned to determine the minimum import of fuel based on the low availability of foreign exchange.In the case of food stuffs we need to grow our own foodstuff and save the valuable foreign exchange going out.  Increasing the reliance on renewable energy will also reduce the usage of fuel for generating electricity.We are not in a position to go for more foreign loans as this would mean that we will get further indebted and even portions of the country will have to be sold to foreigners to repay loans. This should be avoided as we have the capacity, professionals, technical and devoted citizens to develop like countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Korea who were unseen and unheard at the time we obtained independence in 1948. We need honest ‘Can Do People’ with a love for the country who can contribute to develop Sri Lanka with a strong leadership.We will also lose the foreign exchange earnings from the tourism and the garment sector and other exports to the European markets and USA which will be a big hit. The growing IT/BPM industry exports should also be closely monitored,developed and supported as a major export earner opening new opportunities to take Sri Lanka to the high tech era supported by the universities and the new IT colleges.Therefore, we need to immediately cut the import of all goods that can be produced locally to save foreign exchange. Hence imports under FTA should not be permitted to harm local industries. Priority for local economy and industriesAll local industries should be promoted and given due protection, financial assistance and tax incentives. All large businesses and industries should use the SME sector to make the SME sector successful and produce goods and services at competitive prices. Already some of the bigger companies, especially those in the retail trade are buying directly from farmers to give fresh vegetables and fruits to customers.This concept of outsourced work is done on a big scale and used by foreign companies especially in the IT, BPO/BPM sector and India is a country that has greatly benefited. However, the foreign markets will be affected in the present context.The Government needs to give high priority to technology by computerising all the government departments and ministries to improve the efficiencies and productivity and this work should be given to local experts and companies who can contribute to build our economy in this economic downturn. This strategy will also assist companies to use outsourced components, goods and services to be provided to make themselves competitive in the marketplace.The Government could also implement the work from home concept which has been introduced recently with the problems encountered by undertaking computerisation. The government should also give incentives to all companies that go for the concept of using local outsourced goods and services.This will also promote rural industries like how we set up the 200 garment factories project which enabled the garments sector to be the number one exporter from Sri Lanka. This sector is today  badly affected and the industry should be provided all assistance to stage a recovery as the largest foreign exchange earner.With the prominence we plan to give the agricultural sector, the food-based industry, small, medium and large should be encouraged and given all support and incentives. We need to go with the slogan ‘Made in Sri Lanka’ and change our mentality from imported or foreign goods and services to locally manufactured goods and services. The plantation and agricultural exports too will be hit but may not be to the same extent of the garment and industrial exports. The plantation sector should be made more productive and cost competitive and modern techniques brought in to make them viable. All assistance should be given to this sector to retain the export markets. Restructuring of loss making State CorporationAll state corporations running at losses such as Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Ceylon Electricity Board, Sri Lankan Airlines will need expert management to take them forward on a war-footing to make people work, increase productivity, make them profitable and make those in charge accountable and performance monitored on a regular basis.The government will in no way be able to subsidise these State institutions and absorb the huge losses they are making especially at a time when we are in a dire economic situation.  Accountability needs to be brought in at all levels so that those given responsibility at all levels will be held accountable and responsible for their work performance and priority given to least cost production and services with productivity and value creation to face this grave threat facing the economy and society.At present it is taken for granted that state corporations can run at losses but not after COVID 19 Pandemic which is pushing us to become beggars with such performances and government and society cannot tolerate such incompetencies and losses to destroy the economy and harm the people. This would be applicable to all state corporations and government institutions such as the railway and transport boards which are heavily subsidised. Education and use of technologyThe education sector need to be restructured to immediately convert the rural schools to teach Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths (STEM) subjects without producing a large number of arts students passing the A/L and going into universities which have the largest number of undergraduates in the arts stream at entry and when passing out.The introduction of STEM will enable Sri Lanka to become a technology hub producing useful graduates to develop the economy. Modern methods of learning using new technology such as e-learning, video lectures will give rural students the same facilities as those in urban areas, instead of the stock excuse that we do not have sufficient science teachers.One cannot understand this excuse given over the past three decades when we have so many Advanced Level qualified students in the Science stream who can be recruited for graduate training with assured jobs to serve in difficult areas. Research and Development will be another important area which has to be covered in all sectors to enable new innovations and  developments to assist agriculture, industry, health and other sectors especially for boosting local industrial production and services and exports. It is essential to set up IT and English language colleges throughout the country as Public Private Partnership (PPP) initiatives so that opportunities are provided to all youth to study programmes which will provide job opportunities where the government can provide the course fees to students and the private sector and foreign investors can find the jobs.Skill development in other sectors should also be given the highest priority as there is a great demand for those with skills in carpentry, masonry, electricians, technicians, plumbers, construction workers and others where there are many  vacancies and self - employment opportunities and to give them a recognized certificate which will enable them to obtain a good job and wage for their skills and expertise.New work methodology and cultureWe need to transform our economy, the local industry, agriculture, education, plantation industry, banking and finance, exports, business and commerce to meet the new challenges and drive it forwards. Considering the current strength given by the dedicated Medical Doctors, Nurses and other health staff with the assistance and strength provided by the armed services and the police has provided a New Work Methodology and Culture with the direction of the President and Prime Minister which one can say is very successful and result oriented and to work towards the elimination of the COVID 19 Pandemic.This new work methodology could be used to set up the National Committees for the Development of the Economy Post COVID 19 Pandemic. The National Operation Centre for the Prevention of the Covid-19 Pandemic is a new innovative project committee which has been set up and a similar concept could be used to Managing Business through COVID 19 Pandemic to transform from Global to a Local Economy and is an opportunity we should not miss to make Sri Lanka the Granary of the East and dynamic business hub in the Indian Ocean. The writer is a Chartered and Management Accountant and former Chairman and Director General of the BOI and  Chairman, Peoples Bank"
21 March 2021,What is human in human capital(ism)?,"“Train people well enough so they can leave. Treat them well enough so they wouldn’t want to.” – Sir Richard BransonThe transition from traditional to knowledge economy where new trends and technologies are being introduced faster than one can even get used to, requires every human being to become life-long learners.This has made the ‘formal education’ or at least the ‘qualification gathering’ the highest priority of one’s life. Education in general and higher education in particular have become investments people make with the expectation of better employment and higher wages.But most of the educators and educational institutes claim that the purpose of education is to ‘equip people with the knowledge they need to make free and independent decisions’ in living the life they have planned for themselves.The fact that there is an economic basis underpinning those individual choices makes them very much dependent on various factors such as political climate, the economy and the social and cultural norms of their living environment. Since higher education cannot be seen as detached from the lower levels, most of these factors and concepts mentioned here would have some, if not all of their tentacles wrapped in the whole system of formal education.As waiting until a child begins school at the age of five or six seems like an unnecessary risk, institutions of early childhood education, have emerged to take up the slack between birth and school to reduce the likelihood of educational failure. Some countries have even started to subsidise pre-school education since they are reluctant to rely upon the parents to invest appropriately in their children’s education.Education and labor marketEven though educational policy dynamics can vary across countries and their political landscape, one would find a great deal of commonalities, especially, within the context of globalization. The debate on the purpose of higher education has become the most important component of the discussions among the policy makers who live in the framework of market-driven economies. Social scientists have been highlighting the increase of social inequalities despite the efforts to increase the participation in higher education.Labour market driven higher education policies have increased the competition among the recipients and the degrees have become assets that can be converted to a labour market value. Education is no longer considered as a necessity for human development other than as an instrument for economic progress. Educational institutions have become almost like automated degree producing factories in their efforts to make the process as customer friendly as possible in order to attract better clientele.These same institutes use phrases such as ‘student-centered learning’ and ‘opportunities for individualised programs’ that are contradictory to the assembly-line like process of issuing degrees. The world has accepted this concept of using children as raw material for these education factories in the process of manufacturing adults the market needs to sustain the economic progress. The advancement of the ICT has made it much easier even to reach thousands of customers from all over the world at any given time.Human capitalOne of the early attempts to estimate the monetary value of a human being was by Sir William Petty in the late sixteen hundred. He considered labour as the ‘father of wealth’ therefore must be included in any estimate of national wealth of a country.He extended this idea of ‘Human Capital’ to showcase the power of England, to explain the economic effects of human migration and the monetary loss to a nation due to deaths, especially during the wars.A more scientific explanation of human capital was introduced in1800s where cost of production and future earning potentials of a human being considered into estimating the capital value. This process of capitalising an individual’s earnings minus his consumption or maintenance created a way to calculate the compensation for loss of life.Economists in the past have tried all types of different methods to include human beings or their acquired abilities and skills as a component of capital and recognised the importance of investment in human beings as a means of increasing their productivity.This idea of including human beings in the concept of capital addresses the cost of rearing and educating human beings as a real cost, the product of their labour as an addition to the national wealth and an expenditure on a human being that increases that product as an addition to the national wealth.The re-discovery of human capital in the mid-twentieth century doesn’t seem to be a discovery at all. It is just an invention of a technology through which the productive capacity of a human being and of a population can be measured. Investment in human capital then, is analogous to an investment in physical stock, the means of production.But the investment in human capital stock is different from other forms of capital investment in fixed stock since one cannot separate a person from his knowledge, skills and health the way it is possible to move financial and physical assets while the owner stays at the same place. An efficient measure of human capital should be able to measure the value of all layers of socialisation, which occur over the span of an individual’s life including childhood with his family and/or with any other environment.This will highlight one’s education as the main contributing factor to one’s capital and that will directly connect the public investments in schools as the most important investment in human capital.Importance of educationPublic education is largely been provided by governments as a means of fulfilling a need for labour to have a minimum level of schooling. Then there is another segment of the society that can afford private education through which they expect to gather a greater capital than others.Therefore, an education system that would allow an individual the freedom to choose the best path for him to improve his intellectual capacity while increasing his contribution to the capital is an important component of the development of a nation.Even with the existing systems of education, the real constraint facing children around the world may be the inability to borrow against future income to buy a parental environment that will allow them to fulfill their potential, which is sometimes called the accident of birth.Sir Ken Robinson, who was an international advisor on education, once said: “Human resources are like natural resources, they are often buried deep.You have to go looking for them, they are not just lying around on the surface. You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves.”(The writer has served in higher education sector as an academic over twenty years in the USA and fourteen years in Sri Lanka and he can be contacted at [email protected]"
23 August 2020,TAMAP workshop on digital solutions for farmers,"The European Union-funded ‘Technical Assistance to the Modernisation of Agriculture Programme’ (TAMAP) conducted a workshop on e-Agriculture and Digital Market Platforms in Colombo to provide stakeholders a platform to gain a further understanding of current applications and initiatives of e-agriculture systems,TAMAP in collaboration with the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute (HARTI) brought together private and public sector entities to discuss digital solutions for farmers. Participants were provided with information regarding new agricultural technology applications to expand markets and market opportunities. The current Covid-19 crisis also underscored the need to harness e-agriculture solutions.TAMAP Team Leader Dr. Christof Batzlen said, “TAMAP has started to analyse the demand for e-agriculture solutions in Sri Lanka.TAMAP and HARTI launched this discussion to take stock of who is doing what and to examine the nature of the long term plans. The workshop is an entry point for further discussions, regarding the facilitation of e-agriculture and to provide direction and recommendations for e-agriculture and digital market platforms in Sri Lanka.”Joining the workshop via Zoom, Sebastian Balcerak of TAMAP provided a market perspective on ‘What is e-Agriculture? Overview on Various e-Agriculture Systems and Applications in the Global World’. He elaborated on the EU’s existing support for e-agriculture, current players, large and small, and interactions between buyers and sellers. Outlining FAO’s ‘Digital Agriculture Strategy, Approach and Plan for e-Agriculture in Sri Lanka’, FAO Representative in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Dr. Xuebing Sun said, “e-Agriculture is one of the major strategies used by the FAO to promote transformational change in the agricultural sector.FAO is committed to assist the government and its partners to support an emerging digital society.” As the agency responsible for dissemination of appropriate agriculture technologies to farming communities, the National Agriculture Information and Communication Centre, Department of Agriculture’s representative at the workshop,  Director, S. Periyasamy spoke on ‘What are GoSL’s requirements for an e-agriculture system in Sri Lanka’.He said that although NAICC encountered challenges to engage stakeholders in an action plan, several ICT initiatives designed by the Department of Agriculture are being successfully implemented. Director and CEO, HARTI, Prof. Ranjith Premalal De Silva, outlining his views on ‘Digital Market Platforms – Issues and Expectations’, asked if farmers are prepared to undertake this change and move towards virtual interaction. He said, “From farm-gate to food plate, the length of the supply chain can be minimised through digital market platforms.”  Several representatives of digital market platform providers in the agriculture sector such as the HARTI platform, Croptronix’s Govipola, Epic’s Helaviru and Dialog’s Govi Mithuru provided information about their platforms and product offerings. This was followed by a panel discussion. Prof Buddhi Marambe of Peradeniya University of Agriculture facilitated the workshop and the panel discussions. Program Manager at the EU Delegation, Dr. Olaf Heidelbach said, “My main recommendation for the future - on the country’s e-agriculture strategy - is to identify the comparative advantages of different stakeholders by establishing who is doing what, best.The development of e-Agriculture in Sri Lanka depends to a large extent on private sector initiatives.” "
5 September 2021,"IMF allocation, B’desh swap and Chinese loan stabilises forex market - State Minister Cabraal","The receipt of the allocation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) , the loan from the China Development Bank and the swap arrangement with Bangladesh Central Bank will improve liquidity  and stabilize the forex market, said State Minister of Finance, Ajith Nivard Cabraal.He said exporters and importers who expected the Rupee to depreciate would now do well to convert forex receipts early and phase out imports. However, Sri Lanka’s  debt for the remainder of the year and next year is around USD 2 billion according to statistics.Sri Lankan reserves strengthened by receiving USD 787 million from the IMF and  a further USD 150 million from Bangladesh Central Bank as a swap arrangement while a further RMB 2000 mn (around USD 300 mn) from China Development Bank  to be received shortly.The IMF distributed a total SDR allocation equivalent to US dollars 650 billion among its member countries on August 23, in proportion to their existing quotas in the IMF. This provides additional liquidity to the global economy, at a time of an unprecedented crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic, supplementing countries’ foreign exchange reserves and reducing their reliance on expensive domestic and/or external debt.Countries can use the space provided by the SDR allocation to support their economies and step up their fight against the adverse effects caused by the pandemic. The IMF SDR allocation is not a loan from the IMF and no specific conditionalities attached to the allocation. Previously, the IMF had allocated SDRs to member countries in 2009, 1979-81, and 1970-72.The foreign currency swap facility from the Bangladesh Bank totalling US dollars 200 million was agreed upon in view of strengthening economic and financial cooperation between the two countries. This swap facility has been provided for a period of 3 months with the possibility of rolling over twice for similar periods, and it will be disbursed in three tranches, i.e., US dollars 50 million, US dollars 100 million, and US dollars 50 million.  The first two tranches have already been received. The Government of Sri Lanka expects to receive the remainder of the syndicated loan from China Development Bank shortly. This disbursement completes the total syndicated loan of US dollars 1.3 billion from China Development Bank. These foreign exchange receipts help improve the country’s Gross Official Reserves, while enabling the Central Bank to further facilitate the liquidity conditions in the domestic foreign exchange market.With the materialisation of envisaged inflows, including non-debt creating foreign currency inflows to the Government, Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange reserves are expected to improve further in the period ahead. SDRs are being distributed to countries in proportion to their quota shares in the IMF and Sri Lanka has qualified to receive SDR 578 million or US $ 816 million at current rates.Sri Lanka received its share of the global SDR allocation by the IMF and the initial disbursements under the bilateral currency swap arrangement between the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the Bangladesh Bank last month. Sri Lanka’s gross official reserves dropped to 2,833.5 million US dollars in July 2021, from 4,060 million in June after a billion US dollar bond and some other accounts were repaid in July, official data show. The Central Bank raised  the Standing Deposit Facility Rate  and the Standing Lending Facility Rate  by 50 basis points each, to 5.00 percent and 6.00 percent and  the Statutory Reserve Ratio  applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of licensed commercial banks (LCBs) by 2.0 percentage points to 4.00 percent, to addressing the imbalances on the external sector of the economy and to preempt the buildup of any excessive inflationary pressures over the medium term, amidst improved growth prospects.The deficit in the trade account widened on a year-on-year basis for the fourth consecutive month in June 2021. Both exports and imports were significantly higher in June 2021 compared to June 2020. Considering the first half of the year, although exports recorded a healthy growth, import expenditure increased at a higher pace. Workers’ remittances recorded a year-on-year decline in June 2021, while earnings from tourism remained at minimal levels. In the financial account, both foreign investment in the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) continued to record marginal net outflows during the month. "
21 March 2021,Buying and selling shares,"(Part 6 appeared last week)Market or Limit order? A market order is defined as an order to buy or sell a security at the best price or prices prevailing in the market. Whereas a limit order is where the maximum buying price or minimum selling price is specified. A buy limit order can only be executed at the limit price or lower, and a sell limit order can only be executed at the limit price or higher. There is no guarantee of a limit order being executed. Steps to buying sharesStep 1 - Inform your Stockbroker of the name of the company, price and amount of shares you want to purchase. Step 2 - The Stockbroker will try and match your order. Step 3 - Once the order is processed, he will inform you of the shares you were able to purchase at the price you had requested. After the buying process is complete, you will receive a Bought Note. Steps to Selling Shares Step 1 - Inform your Stockbroker about the stock you wish to sell - the name of the company, the price and the number of shares to be sold. Step 2 - The Stockbroker will try to match your order. Step 3 - If your order is not matched, he will inform you and negotiate a suitable price. Once the order is matched, it will be processed. If the Stockbroker sells your shares, you will receive a Sold Note for your transaction. Many companies have very active markets for their shares with a large portion of shares traded on a daily basis. But there are also companies that have relatively little activity in their shares. The difference between the buy price and the sell price might be quite a bit wider for an illiquid stock than for a liquid stock. If you want to buy a larger quantity of shares of an illiquid stock, you might have to pay more than the current sell price in order to purchase the entire quantity you need.CDS statement The CDS statement is a summary of all the transactions that have taken place in your CDS account and shows you the remaining share balance. A monthly and/or quarterly statement is issued to all active account holders while an annual statement is issued to inactive account holders. Factors to be considered when selecting shares The types of shares you may come across in the market are based on factors such as return, value, growth potential and risk. We will now look at more company and industry specific factors that could affect your decision.Valuation Ratios (also known as Valuation Multiples) Ratios such as Price Earnings Ratio (P/E), Price to Book Value Ratio (P/BV), Dividend Yield (DY) and Price to Cash Flow Ratio (P/CF) for the share must be looked into. These ratios should always be compared with a relevant benchmark to give meaning analysis. Attractiveness of the Industry Different industry sectors display characteristics that may either attract or repel investors. Factors such as market demand and supply for the goods or services produced, competition among industry players, industry specific government regulations and expected growth of the industry and the impact of economic and political stability ought to be considered when investing.Financial Performance of the Company It is important that you research and use the wealth of information provided in a company’s financial statements and other publications when evaluating a company as a potential investment. While taking into consideration the company’s position in the industry.(To be continued)Courtesy: The Colombo Stock Exchange"

23 May 2021,Macau model with Govt. control needed - Economist,"Port City is a development project already completed and cannot be abandoned. However, the present challenge is to put it to best use, said former Central Bank Deputy Governor Dr. W.A. Wijewardena.He said the option available is to go for a model like Macau where there is a separate system of economic activities different from mainland China. If not the Port City would be like a flotilla of ships anchored offshore doing business with the rest of the world with our permission. Though it is a separate system, it is finally under the control of the central government in Beijing. What this means is that at any time the concessions given to Macau can be revoked if its functioning is viewed as a threat to the country’s broad interests.Hence, in the port city, Sri Lanka government should retain the final deciding power and Parliament should have power to revoke the concessions afforded it, Dr. Wijewardena said.He also noted it will be a separate economic zone in which many activities which are not undertaken in other parts of the country would be undertaken. That will include free casinos and gambling catering to the rich in other countries. In other countries where casinos have been permitted in a particular place, it has been reported that as complementary products, other types of vices too have proliferated. It is inevitable in the Port City too. hat should be done is to have an effective mechanism in place to prevent its spillover to the rest of the country since these activities are not legally permitted there. The strict supervision and surveillance done in Genting Highlands in Malaysia may provide guidance in this regard.“I have seen similar activities being done in Cambodia in ships anchored offshore and locals are not permitted to visit them. They do business with foreigners, make money and take the profits for themselves.“The economic benefits have been overestimated when claims are made that it would be a turning point for Sri Lanka. Its contribution to the national economy is simply the marginal value addition by way of labour services, use of utilities and rents. It does not add to government coffers and hence, it is not a solution to the current low income and debt issues of the country. Hence, Port City cannot make Sri Lanka a rich country.“As such, to address the present economic problems faced by the country, a separate set of policy strategies aiming at creating high value employment and high tech exports should be adopted. Without that, it is like a flotilla of ships anchored offshore and doing business with the rest of the world with our permission.Professor in Economics, University of Colombo, Sirimal Abeyratne said he does not see any problem with the proposed structure of the Port City as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) that would be managed entirely separately.“It is necessary because we have got hundreds of SEZs within Asia. Some of them are separate city states such as Singapore, while the majority of them such as Dubai are separate business enclaves established within their countries. Our neighbour India has set up many SEZs under its SEZ Act of 2005, while they can be set up as Central government-owned or State government-owned or even privately owned SEZs, Abeyratne said.“If Sri Lanka has to capitalise on its locational advantage and to compete with the SEZs in Asia, it has to be “better than the best in Asia”, he said..The controversies over the Port City Economic Commission Bill emerged over a number of critical issues. While the legal battle regarding the inconsistencies between two legal documents is now over, there is concern over the creation of a “fast track” for business within the Port City. It has to be on a fast track if it should compete with its peers in the region. Another concern is that it has created space for corruption.“I must say that Sri Lanka has an international reputation for being one of the corrupt countries in the world, according to international data reports; obviously, economic activities in the Port City are open for corruption and corruption with “big money”. It is a problem of the lack of rule of law – enforceability and impartiality of law, rather than an exclusive attribute of the Port City. It is necessary to fight corruption, and not fight against a development initiative to attack corruption.Apparently, even if the Port City is better than all its competitors in the neighbourhood, its success will depend on how the A-grade investors in the world perceive not only the Port City, but also the entire country. In that sense, it is necessary to fight corruption and to extend and expand some of the pro-development features of the Port City Bill to the entire country as well.Port city project experts also noted that if the Bill is enacted it would have a major dent on the country’s legal and political sovereignty in numerous ways. Exemptions from national law, discretionary power vested on the Commission, the composition of the governing body, limitation of parliamentary and judicial oversight of the Commission’s operations to the impact of the Bill’s provisions on fundamental rights, franchise of Sri Lankans and the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka are some of the major threats to the sovereignty of the country that have been identified.Eco activists and the People’s Movement against the port city project said that people’s representatives who took part in the parliamentary debate on the Port City Commission Bill should realize that the project is destroying the country.They urged the lawmakers to observe the coast of Thoduwa, Chilaw, which is eroding these days before debating.,According to the Supreme Court determination announced by the Speaker last week certain provisions of the Port City Economic Commission Bill was inconsistent with the Constitution. The court directed that the clauses needed to be passed by a special majority and a referendum as they were unconstitutional.The Bill was debated in Parliament last week."

6 December 2020,ThirdShift wins silver at ‘Campaign of the Year’ awards,"ThirdShift, the Independent Media Agency of SHIFT, won the Silver award for Media Agency of the Year for the ‘Rest of South Asia’ category, at the Campaign - Agency of the Year Awards recently for the second consecutive year. CEO of ThirdShift, Prasanga Jayatunga said, “We stepped into the media business landscape in 2017. By that time, I had done my stint in the international media agency business and had been Leader, Mindshare and CEO of Media Factory.“I was enriched by those experiences, and the idea of venturing out on my own had crossed my mind, specifically because I believed that I could tailor-make solutions and work with clients on hand-crafted media solutions.“Perhaps the yearning to be creative within the Media business is what drove me to agree with the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Shift, Chrishani Kotalawela and Sujeewa Samarasekera, when they invited me to join them and start ThirdShift.“Sujeewa and Chrishy were veterans of the industry but had never handled media, however, I took the opportunity that was given to me and went ahead with it. I didn’t think it all through. I decided and gave my word and it has been a rocking ride. It’s been a lot of hard work, sweat, tears and sleepless nights.But awards like this really reminded me that as a team, we have done justice to our Clients and Client Brands; the real reason behind this company’s success,” he said."
8 July 2018,"Country should aim at $12,650 per capita income - DHAMMIKA PERERA","Building knowledge and focusing on district oriented development are key factors that will boost development in the country in the next five years, leading businessman Dhammika Perera told journalists at the ‘Bell Ringing’ ceremony to mark Vallibel One’s entry into the S&P SL 20 Index at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) last week.He said, “Look at how NASA invested US$ 4 billion on space companies in the US to develop space technology. I conducted some brain storming sessions for Ordinary Level students and urged them to think about what they want to be in the future.” “A per capita income of US$ 12,650 is what the country should aim at in the next three years to achieve development. Colombo will achieve it in the next three years and the balance 95 percent must come from the other cities. If we can bring the other cities to that level it will not be difficult to achieve the goal,” the versatile businessman said.He said tourism is a key sector and how we could drive growth in is not simply banking on attracting only high end spenders but also the low end segment. Around 50 percent of the airlines flying to Malaysia and Thailand are budget airlines which has helped attract large number of visitors. “If someone says there are too many taxes in the country or the currency has been weakened too much, they must have better strategies to counter the argument. I have told my board directors not to make the country an excuse for performance. There is no way they could get away. They have to come up with answers,” the entrepreneur cum investor said.The optimistic and pragmatic looking entrepreneur said that his companies are not harnessing technology adequately to reduce cost and boost efficiency. “I realise that we are not using technology sufficiently. I have studies the benefits of using artificial intelligence and within the next six months all board discussions will be captured into a screen using business intelligence tools which will help save time and cost. Reducing cost is the biggest challenge and we will be having a solution for the cost increase in the next five years,” Perera said.Vallibel One, a conglomerate under Dhammika Perera, comprises 45 subsidiaries across seven industry sectors with a market capitalisation of Rs. 18.66 billion. The company is engaged in multiple business sectors such as finance, lifestyle, plantations, leisure, packaging, healthcare and consumer.Vallibel One incorporated in 2007 is public quoted company in the Colombo Stock Exchange.CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike said the S&P SL 20 Index is designed to guage the performance of 20 largest and liquid companies in the country and entering into the index means that the company is among the top 20 having adequate liquidity, size and is in a position to attract foreign investors. "
27 September 2020,Agility vital for business stability,"Traditionally, business organisations have been run as machines. You set them up and watch them run; everyone has a pre-determined and rigidly set role and a top-down approach to management and goal setting, with little room for creativity and adaptation. Thankfully, things have changed, and today, businesses are more like living organisms — they evolve by the day.With the recent developments – epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters and terrorism, agile companies have become a necessity, primarily due to rapidly evolving and shifting business environments, fierce competition, rapidly changing consumer wants and disruptive new technologies.Business agility simply means a company can speedily respond according to market evolution and environmental changes. This might sound like a simple concept, but it remains an elusive one for business leaders, many of whom have yet to fully implement business agility, despite the many advantages it offers.AdvantagesWhat are the benefits of agility at work? Is agile on your list of competitive advantages? Can your business react and change its game plan based on either customer feedback or shifts in market, all while keeping that end vision in focus?A successful business has the ability to assess any given situation and decide how to proceed based on the findings.Before your business can become agile, first you must be well-acquainted with the principles and characteristics of an agile organisation: leaders are self-aware and motivated, encourages leadership that forward-looking and inspires everyone around them to perform to their potential, dedicated to continuous learning and training, encourages and supports collaboration, communication, and information sharing through use of technology and management processes, focus on long-term goals and objectives.If you have an old-fashioned approach to management that essentially equates to micromanagement, you will spend all your time directing and controlling.However, if you encourage your employees to take initiative, have ownership of their goals and careers, and make difficult decisions, you will be rewarded with employees who are engaged and empowered.Agile organisations respect their employees enough to delegate responsibility and authority. Though agile organisations still have a top-level structure, they adopt a more flexible approach, because agile leaders know this breeds accountability and collaboration.Empowered teamsTo encourage the formation of empowered teams, you need to adapt your approach to goal setting. Instead of having a traditional trickle-down approach, consider aligning your goals upwards.Employees should be encouraged to speak up and give feedback to improve their surroundings. This will help employees feel they are a valued member of a productive, powerful team, especially when they see their suggestions put into effect.Whether you are building a new agile organisation or attempting to make your business more agile, it’s important to remember that transparency is key.Information transparency involves giving employees access to operational and financial information. Such transparency can encourage interdepartmental insights and ideas, regardless of position or seniority, which can help a business grow, strengthen and develop.Creating agile peopleEqually important is an organisation’s attitude towards training and development.After all, it has been shown that companies that incorporate the use of innovative learning and development programs retain their staff for longer.Businesses should encourage the use of personal development plans and continuous learning. This way, you will benefit from well-informed and determined employees who are loyal to your organisation, as they know you have taken the time and effort to invest in their futures.In an agile organisation, aims and objectives will change regularly.You will need to keep track of training opportunities and allow for real-time feedback, in addition to scheduling and tracking regular performance discussions.To support this, agile businesses should make use of modern collaboration and performance management software, leaving them free to focus on critical tasks that ultimately will affect the bottom line of their organisation.Following the previous benefits, we arrive at the last one - building resilience.By challenging people to be more agile, which involves taking action, expressing their ideas and standing behind them with responsibility and control, you can improve not only the individual but also the overall organisational resilience.These are only a few of the many benefits of bringing agility to the workplace.The biggest strength of the modern organisation is the ability to create a sustainable advantage and only the organisation’s agility could create this power."
19 April 2020,Int’l celebrities donate lavishly to fight pandemic,"Most politicians are known for upsetting the apple cart rather than helping ease tensions and ameliorating living standards of people, said a former corporate leader and now a philanthropist citing Scottish novelists and playwright Irvine Welsh “Politicians are so … detested, they don’t actually walk amongst people now.” He said unlike in the good old days getting present day state leaders to understand the needs of  the people and support them in times of crisis is something we could  expect when pigs fly. “Politicians here and abroad have been tight fisted when many celebrities, business leaders and philanthropists  have lavishly donated funds to rid the world of the menace,” he said, adding that it is disheartening to see world leaders putting a spoke in the good work initiated across countries to eliminate the killer virus.Some of the  biggest names in the business and celebrity world such as Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster, TV host Ryan Seacrest, Len Blavatnik, a British-American businessman, Phil Knight, co-founder of Nike, Jack Ma, the Co-founder of Alibaba Group and Bill Gates, co-chairman and co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation made donations to the efforts of fighting the  pandemic.Hugh Grosvenor donated $12.5 million to his country’s coronavirus relief efforts on top of the $3.1 million he gave in March.Ryan Seacrest gave $1 million to help with relief efforts in New York City and Los Angeles.Len Blavatnik donated $1 million through The Blavatnik Family Foundation to buy protective equipment and ventilators and prepare ICU beds at hospitals.Phil Knight along with his wife and other company executives, together donated $10 million toward Covid-19 response efforts.“Politicians do not lift a figure to ease the burden of  hapless victims of the unforeseen situation but rather heap burden on the afflicted masses,” he said.Business personalities who had already set a precedent by contributing to the worthy cause in Sri Lanka said the principle of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) should not apply only to business organisations but also to all organisations and individuals who should  be concerned about people and the planet while paying attention to making profits.The stance of the US President Donald Trump to halt funding the World Health Organization to battle the deadly virus drew heavy flak from across the world that is making a concerted effort  to get over the crisis.The US is the WHO’s biggest single funder, providing $400m (£316m) last year - just under 15% of its total budget.China’s contribution in 2018-19 was almost $76m in assessed contributions and about $10m in voluntary funding, according to the WHO website."

13 December 2020,Confusing advertising with marketing,"Advertising and marketing are very different things. There are many ways to market your business, and advertising is only one way to do it. In fact, advertising is often the most expensive way to market your business.If you think advertising is the same thing as marketing, you have limited yourself to only using the most expensive way to market your business. There are lots of ways to market your business that are cheaper than advertising, and often more effective. Most people think that if they spend X million rupees on their website and online marketing campaign, they will get Y amount of business. If you want to get more business, you just need to spend more money in advertising, right? This is absolutely wrong.Spending more money on advertising does not necessarily mean more business. More often than not, it simply means you’ve spent more money, and you now have less money in the bank account.Spending more on advertising may or may not be the key to bringing in more business. As you’ll learn, effective advertising requires you to deliver the right message to the right people at the right time in the right way.Simply having more website ads, or a bigger Pay Per Click budget is often not the way to bring in more business. How effective are your PPC ads? Are you advertising in the right place? Who is seeing your ads? Are these people the best customers for you? Your consultant will be going into great detail with you regarding the effectiveness of your advertising.Marketing is not spending more moneyIf all you do is listen to the sales pitch of some search marketing rep and sign up with them, you might be misled to believe that effective marketing means spending a lot of money.These sales reps want to make you think this way, because the more money you spend with them, the more commission they make. If you become emotional and start thinking how this one advertising will bring in all the business in the world for you, you become an easy prey for these sales reps to take your money.The truth is – effective web marketing does not have to be expensive. If your marketing is done right and done methodically rather than emotionally, it’s not as expensive as you might think. I cannot emphasise enough that marketing is a lot more than advertising or selling. It’s about providing an excellent customer experience, which involves putting systems in place so that customers get a consistent, high quality experience no matter which employee is working that day.The key to marketing is offering an excellent customer experience. You can’t just offer excellent service one day and crappy service another day. No matter how busy you are, no matter who is working that day – every customer must get the same customer experience every single time.How do you do that? You must implement systems and procedures, and make every employee follow them. This is how we do things around here. They either follow it, or they are out the door.Since marketing is how customers perceive you, there are lots of ways to improve how you are perceived. Buying a bigger ad might increase your visibility when people get exposed to the media, but do you know that there are a lot cheaper and more effective ways to improve how you are perceived?TrainingIt might be as simple as training your employees on how to answer the phone. This is what you say when you pick up the phone, this is what you say when a customer asks for this, this is what you say when a customer shouts at you.You begin to set rules that your employees must follow. For example, answering each online visitor questions in a courteous and efficient manner. The exact rules and procedures will depend on your business, but you must have some kind of rules that everybody follows.Guess how much it costs to write down a couple of rules and make every employee follow them? It costs nothing. Guess how much better you’ll be perceived in the eyes of your customers? A lot. Is this effective marketing? You bet it is.I am not saying advertising is not important. Advertising is one important way to attract new customers. In fact, we will be dedicating a large portion of this article to the subject of advertising. But you should always remember that marketing is how you’re perceived by your customers, and advertising is only one way (and often the most expensive way) to improve that perception.Since advertising is one important way to bring customers into the website or store front, we will now discuss this subject in detail. Before we delve into the details of advertising, let’s talk about what must go right for advertising to work.Keep promisesVery simply, you must keep your promises. How many times have you seen the web site or advertising of some company, thought that they must be a big and reputable company, used their service – only to discover that the service they provided was way below your expectations? Did you become a repeat customer? Did you tell anyone not to go there?Successful advertising brings customers through the door, but you must keep your promises. If your ads portray a much better image of your business than it actually is, customers won’t stay. They might begin telling their friends not to come to you, then your advertising backfires. On the other hand, there is a philosophy of “under-promise, and over deliver”. Is this a good idea? In our opinion, over-delivering is a good idea, but under-promising is not.The business environment is getting a lot more competitive today. Customers won’t come to you if you under-promise. If you can provide a service better than your competitors can, what’s the point of being humble and under-promising? Tell customers proudly that you can do this, and amaze them when they come.Think about your advertisements right now. What are some places you’ve promised too much? What are some places you haven’t promised enough? Do you have systems in place to ensure that your promises are met every time – no matter how difficult running a business today is in the new normal world.How much to invest on advertisingHow much money should you spend on advertising? Some consultants will throw you a number like 8-10% of revenues. Some people would say that you need to spend whatever your competitors spend. Others will tell you that you should only spend what you can afford.There is also another school of thought that says you should determine your goal, and set the budget according to the goal. No wonder why people get confused. Yes, there are lots of ways to determine your advertising budget, and each method works better than others in different types of industries, and different sizes of companies. While Covid-19 has shrunk the market significantly, the only way to compete is by doing the right type of marketing."
16 August 2020,Webinar on ‘Growing Resilient Businesses’,"The European Union Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives in partnership with Chrysalis, conducted a webinar recently on ‘Growing Resilient Businesses’ showcasing four enterprising men and women from the Central and Uva Provinces, sharing their stories on turning challenges into opportunities.Narrating their individual journeys on the road to recovery were proprietor, SGM Food Products, Sarawanaguru Sivadarsan, proprietor, Araliya Fashion Wear, Araliya Samarasekera,  Proprietors, Unigro Agency, Usha Nanthini and Senthil Kumar and  National Representative, Surangani Voluntary Services (SVS), Nalin Vipulendra. The event was moderated by  Senior Technical Advisor, Chrysalis, Hashitha Abeywardena.Program Manager and Deputy Head of Cooperation of the EU Delegation, Fabrizio Senesi, outlining the objectives of the event said, “Our support to the Sri Lankan economy including the MSMEs is a top priority and this event is to raise awareness of the sector and promote local businesses, which contribute greatly to the country’s economy. The impact of Covid-19   on the economy has been severe, but with it creativity and resilience in the sector and important lessons can be learned. Covid also increased the gaps and barriers for women in business. This webinar will provide opportunities and encouragement particularly to women entrepreneurs.” A beneficiary of the EU funded Enterprise Development project, Araliya Samarasekera said, “My initial challenge during the lockdown was to pay wages to my staff, mostly women. However, I overcame this and then realised the demand for face masks. I understood the first group, which needed our support were frontline health and military personnel who were in dire need of this item. I first sought approval from the health authorities and we then manufactured and distributed them free. It also presented an opportunity to market the masks commercially.” “As a female entrepreneur, challenges can arise at any time and we should be ready to face them,”  she said.Sarawanaguru Shivdarsan, elaborated how his spice manufacturing business withstood Covid-19 challenges. He said, “During the crisis we had to face a cash shortage. Buying material during the lockdown we had to purchase 100% by cash and could not approach banks. However, based on my business plan with my team, we forged ahead.I have a strong customer base and they wait for me to deliver their goods, which was a great strength to my business. Due to Covid-19 I built the business online through a mobile community even receiving orders from new customers.”Offering advice to the younger generation, he said, “Opportunities will not be created automatically. We ourselves have to create opportunities even at a time of crisis.”Owning a PVC fittings business, Usha Nanthini described how she overcame the challenges presented by Covid-19.“A business idea and motivation are the most crucial for success in business. I had stocked material beforehand in the event of any problem and was able to resume production ensuring worker safety. Though many saw Covid-19 as a problem it gave me time to re-think and plan ahead. Through a Whatsapp group I re-organised my customer base and also used the bus routes to strengthen my delivery network. Due to the lockdown, home gardening and the cultivation trend grew which provided a good opportunity to develop fittings for water supply.”“Many say that it is difficult for women to participate in nontraditional work. I disagree. I aim to manufacture products under my own brand in the future. I believe women can do any business. Chrysalis has supported me throughout. Today I am known as Unigro Usha. This has given me confidence to grow and I hope to produce interlock bricks using plastic wastage. If more women are provided with opportunities and enriched, we could break the frame which women are confined to,” she said.Describing how his organisation, engaged in a peanut business, worked to overcome Covid-19 challenges, Nalin Vipulendra said, “The needs of children with special needs were to some extent overlooked during the crisis. It was stressful for them as they could not engage in their day-to-day activities. We made every effort to maintain continuous support and contact with them throughout to provide assistance during this period. We realised that the demand for our products had diminished. We contacted many businesses and provided samples free initially. This resulted in an increased demand for and popularity of our product.”   “We have set up a business forum in Moneragala with 35 entities to develop essential business skills such as computer literacy and entrepreneurial knowledge,” he said."
11 October 2020,Chinese delegation adhered to Covid-19 protocols,"The Foreign Ministry yesterday confirmed that the visiting top Chinese delegation adhered to strict Covid-19 health protocols and their visit was in keeping with a travel bubble concept to prevent any contamination either way. The Foreign Ministry’s China Desk Director General B.Kandeepan told the Sunday Observer yesterday that their brief visit (24 hours) was a long overdue engagement.“President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was to travel to China this year but the trip was postponed due to the Covid-19 outbreak,” he said adding that the visit was important in all aspects of bi-lateral relations for the country, especially in the backdrop of the government trying to overcome the pandemic effects to the country’s economy. The high level delegation headed by former Foreign Minister, key Political Bureau Member of the Communist Party and Diplomat Yan Jeichi included China’s International Development Cooperation Agency Chairman Wang Xiatao and Chinese Foreign Ministry official Cheng Song.The Chinese team comprising 26 delegates had produced PCR test results taken before their departure. Three floors of the Shangrila Hotel were reserved for their overnight stay.The close contacts of the officials were subject to PCR tests after their departure on Friday and the hotel was also disinfected as a precautionary measure.The delegation was escorted to the Shangrila Hotel from the charter flight which arrived at the Bandaranaike International airport.From the hotel, they were escorted to the President’s office and the Prime Minister’s office for official engagements, Kandeepan who is also the contact person at the Foreign Ministry for Covid-19 Task force said.The Foreign Ministry issued the following release on the delegation’s visit yesterday, “As part of the Government’s sustained efforts at strengthening neighbourly relations, the Foreign Ministry facilitated on Friday (9/10) a high-level Chinese delegation composed of a key Political Bureau Member of the Communist Party and Diplomat Yan Jeichi along with the Chairman of China’s International Development Cooperation Agency Wang Xiatao and Chinese Foreign Ministry official Cheng Song to arrive in Sri Lanka.The delegation held discussions with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on Friday, October 9, in the presence of Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Secretary Admiral Prof. Jayanath Colombage and other Government Ministers and dignitaries. Taking stock of the economic cooperation, the leaders recalled the catalytic role played by the Chinese FDI projects operational in Sri Lanka valued at over USD 3 billion, and the significant employment opportunities the projects have so far generated. The delegation and the Government underscored the importance of concluding the projects early towards reaping the benefits from the full potential of these mega Foreign Direct Investments in the country.Recalling the immense support extended by the Chinese government in times of the Covid-19 pandemic, the President thanked the delegation for the valuable assistance and support consistently made available by the Chinese Government. The leaders also expressed their gratitude for the continued support and solidarity extended to Sri Lanka during the humanitarian operation in the North and China’s steadfast support in the Human Rights Council in trying times.Reviewing the two-way trade, the Government called upon the Chinese leaders to facilitate market access to some of Sri Lanka’s unique commodities that could find demand in the Chinese domestic market towards increasing the trade turnover and improving the trade balance which is in favour of China. Both agreed the export basket to China need to be reviewed to increase the trade volume and the need to resume negotiations on the stalled talks on the Sri Lanka–China FTA. The first ever visit by Chinese leaders, during the Covid-19 pandemic to Colombo was organised under strict compliance of the health protocol – an air-bubble concept, of the Ministry of Health.”"
19 April 2020, Importance of disaster preparedness for business,"Any business entity, big or small, faces challenges to continue immediately after a disastrous catastrophe, especially a natural one. The confrontation is more so when such disaster affects the entire world economy. COVID 19 is a mysterious and intangible enemy the whole world is trying to deal with. Due to the intensity of the speed of spread and the high fatality rate, the actual negative global economic impact is not measured as yet.  Therefore, preparing a disaster recovery plan is a very good suggestion for any small or medium sized commercial operation to recuperate. The negative impact on revenue is common to any business in such a scenario although sustainability varies depending on different external and internal factors and the type of business. Most of the large organizations with abundant resources usually have contingency plans, at least on a short term basis. Many of them may have already commenced the process of post disaster strategies. However, the preparedness of Sri Lankan small or medium enterprises is uncertain up to now as this is the very first time they have come up against an intense situation as COVID 19.  Small business entities need to concentrate on developing an emergency plan to minimise disruption to business. To understand the importance of such an action, the owner of the business must comprehend the benefits of preparation. Regrettably, many business owners are not aware that with a plan it is much easier and faster to recover from disaster. As a small or medium sized entrepreneur, you must start evaluating the possible risks and create a disaster preparation plan.       Let me go through the step-by-step process of preparing a short term recovery plan for your business. You will realize that it is not only simple but also extremely appealing as it is about your own survival and possible growth. As the first step, make an assessment by noting down what you have done up to now in your business, successes or failures and any other important matters that come to your mind.During this process, evaluate and analyse your customer base and their behavior up to now. Decide what exactly you want done in the immediate future to start up and continue. This is your immediate mission. With an effective and clear initiative of the mission, the rest will fall in to place. As noted, resumption as early as possible is predominantly essential after a disaster.  The next in line is to prepare an impact analysis to understand the effects of the disaster to your business. Figure out the areas of disruption by the influence of the general situation during and after the virus attack. Also analyse the likely negative issues that will slow down the sales revenue.Based on the information of the impact analysis, identify the resources required to reduce or lessen the bad effects of the disaster. Now you have the gap between the resources you have and what you require immediately to respond to the situation successfully.   Depending on the size, assign specific responsibilities to the team, irrespective of the number of members. Give each of them a goal to achieve. The assignments can vary from identifying the new competition to assess the consumer behavior shifts. Provide suitable effective guide lines and instruct them to report back in writing if possible to give this effort a professional outlook.  Discuss logistics with your suppliers and prepare a new pricing strategy. As much as you, suppliers and service providers, whether they are large or small, are also looking for business themselves. Therefore, this is a good time to renegotiate your buying prices and credit periods. If managed properly, you will be able to obtain better deals and pass on part of the benefits to your customers as a promotional tool.A variety of attractive monetary benefits by way of promotions will be a must after a disaster strike as the cash circulation is at minimum level. It is always recommended to involve yourself personally in these negotiations unless you have a specialised team member. Proprietary interest is the most vital aspect of a small or medium sized business as almost all important decisions are made by the business owner himself. Reaching your clientele is an important element in your plan. Therefore, the business owner has to analyze the best method to communicate his message to the customer. For an example, if the business is confined to a specific geographical territory, the best way to keep the customers informed about your new approach is to advertise through point of sales material, distributing handouts and inserting a small brochure in the newspapers circulated in the area. If the business is larger and reach is more, using email campaigns will be important. However, in both situations, use of facebook postings effectively will offer a very high impact as it has the highest popularity and the reach in Sri Lanka.   In the aftermath of the pandemic, sales will take a downward turn despite your best advertising efforts. Therefore, considering the sensitivity of the message in the right tone is of utmost importance. Remember, just as you, competitors too will be communicating to customers with their respective messages. Hence, to be on top of the completion is also as important. As the communication with customers is of such importance, selecting the best media based on your initial analysis of the situation is vital.   Finally, explore all the relief measures and financial assistance offered by the Government, Banks and other financial institutions. If you have to register with any of the authorities or agencies, do that at the very first instance to be in the first group of beneficiaries.President Rajapaksa and his Government have initiated many supportive measures to the business community, particularly to the SME sector. On President Rajapaksa’s directive, the Central Bank has issued strict instructions to all operating Banks and other financial institutions in the country to comply and offer maximum assistance to the business community.   Although the pandemic is devastating and the world including Sri Lanka is suffering immensely, a clever businessman with a positive mind may see an opportunity to move into the next level of business expansion. Every entrepreneur in the country should try to see a silver lining in the dark cloud of COVID-19 pandemic which will most definitely be over sooner or later. At this crucial juncture, this country needs that from the business sector as assistance to revive the economy. "
1 November 2020,Avoid ‘Get rich quick schemes’ of  unscrupulous borrowers - Financial analyst,"Investors should not be carried away by ‘Get rich quick schemes’ of borrowers offering fabulous returns at high risk which will result in the loss of hard-earned money of depositors, said financial analyst and Past President of Colombo Stock Brokers Association, Ravi Abeysuriya in response to the fear psychosis that has been created with regard to the safety of deposits in financial institutions.He said the saying, “Fools rush where angels fear to tread” should be a guiding principle in investing to avoid pitfalls and regrets. “Do your homework before rushing to invest. All that glitters is no gold.  Look at the risks without considering only the returns. Many ended up losing money because they ignored the risk-return aspects of investment,” Abeysuriya said.He said the unscrupulous will often talk high of the returns to appeal to your greed and rely on your ignorance of risk. You need an independent third party to clarify risk. Do not believe in the sales talk. You will often hear them say, “Your investment is guaranteed. There is no way you can lose your money”. Beware of investments that look too good to be true as they will most likely end up in a total loss to you. Don’t be carried away by ‘Get rich quick schemes’ such as pyramid schemes (where you are promised payments if you introduce more members to the scheme).TV commercials, newspapers advertisements and salesmen calling on you promote a variety of investment options and financial services.Make no mistake, the borrower himself cannot give a guarantee because the grantor is legally required to repay the loan on its due  date. Only a financially strong third party can give you a guarantee that if the borrower defaults they will come forward and repay the loan.If a loan or an investment is guaranteed, the guarantee by the third party should be unconditional and irrevocable, enforceable under all circumstances.In other words the guarantor should not be able to find a way out of not honouring the guarantee when the borrower defaults. Do not yield to high-pressure sales tactics. Thoroughly investigate the investment product  offered and find out the risks involved before investing.Genuine borrowers will be happy to provide you with independent analysis’ research reports and credit ratings and give you time to make an informed decision. A credit rating is a quantified assessment of the creditworthiness of a borrower in general terms or with respect to a particular debt or financial obligation.It  not only determines whether or not a borrower will be approved for a loan or debt issue but also determines the interest rate at which the loan will need to be repaid.Most importantly one should invest only in licensed, regulated financial institutions. However, attractive the proposition may be  if it is not a licensed regulated financial institution you do so at your risk.Be very suspicious of persons who claim to be representing well known organisations who may take you money giving you fake certificates.After investing one needs to continuously monitor his or her investments to see whether they meet the goals and are within the risk tolerance level. Follow markets trends driving interest rates and the stock market.When one invests in any investment product other than Government Bonds, which is risk-free, there is an element of default risk which is due to the institution failing to honour its commitment such as in bank savings and fixed deposits, corporate bonds or debentures, insurance claims and finance company deposits.Investors should use credit ratings to determine whether the risk of that investment meets one’s risk tolerance level and the return offered is adequate for the risk taken.If one fails to verify the risk using a simple tool such as a rating (which is free) when making these investments he or she is bound to make a mistake.Without knowing the rating, the investor will have to make decisions based on the popularity of the institution.A majority of investors in Sri Lanka have only a vague idea of the risk involved  in investing as they do not undertake a thorough investment appraisal.They assume that the government will come to their rescue if the institution they invested on goes bust. Most investors only look for returns ignoring the risk factors. They rarely take into account default risk. In Sri Lanka we have not had banks defaulting but had several financial institutions failed resulting in depositors losing money.“Every investment comes with a risk. Risk is the possibility that the investment’s actual return will be different than expected and includes the possibility of losing part or all of the original investment.In fixed interest products such as fixed deposits and debentures there is default risk and purchasing power risk (the returns being lower than inflation where one cannot buy the same amount of goods that he or she bought before the maturity proceeds of the investment).Investment in shares, unit trusts and gold have market risks or volatility (day-to-day fluctuations of prices due to the behaviour of sentiments of investors  and other factors). Property investments have liquidity risks where one may not be able to convert them to cash. It is vital for investors to know their risk tolerance level.The amount of psychological pain one is willing to suffer for the investment.  A professional investment advisor will provide all the risks involved in an investment before talking about the returns which is the opposite for unscrupulous advisors.  "
5 April 2020, Post-disaster recovery of retail business,"Late Milton Hershey, the American chocolatier and founder of one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in the world, The Hershey Company, once said that he believed that his business is recession-proof and depression proof.It is time that the retail sellers in Sri Lanka also take the cue out of Hershey’s quote and decide what to sell and how to sell to a literally depressed and cash strapped majority clientele in the country. The general world trend is that consumers prefer lower priced goods and services immediately after a short term natural catastrophe irrespective of the socioeconomic status of a country.Sri Lanka is facing a crisis, no doubt. For retailers, effective crisis management, irrespective of whether the business is small, medium or large, will be the key to success or failure.  By focusing adequately on the future and accepting the crisis as an opportunity, they have a fair chance of recovery, even growth. It’s not going to be easy with slow sales, reduced foot traffic and low cash circulation. However, the retailers must try to capitalise on the conception that customers always like to shop personally because of the sense of control they acquire when purchasing retails, especially consumables. First and foremost, the retailer must prepare and devise a plan to restart after the panic passes. Sooner or later the situation will undoubtedly improve as was in the past. Retailers will have to make up for the lost business in order to recover fixed expenses during the closure. Therefore, it is sensible to research how or whether the merchandise possibly can be altered to meet the new situation. Depending on the result of the research, the owner must make a plan to convey an effective message to the clientele, both existing and prospective, through the most suitable relevant mediumThe retailer can effectively apply social media, hand outs, point of sale advertisements or simply a street promotion drive near the store. In my personal opinion, a creative, strong and properly updated face book account can be the key approach to communicate with customers for a small or medium size business.Moving outdoors is a good strategy at a time when the retailer looks for more foot traffic, the general purpose of retailing.  By entering into a nearby sidewalk with an attractive slogan, may be related to the existing circumstances and can be thoroughly effective. When the goods are moved out with a well created outlook, people may become curious and will want to check it out.  This may attract even the customers who usually ignore the store as well.  Creating an event in the store will produce amazing results. Invite your customers and appeal for their help. They will not ignore or abandon you. Customers who were indoors for a long time with restricted movements will love to move around in a stimulating and vibrant environment rather than going to the same gloomy day-to-day store. This is successfully done as a practice by many retail stores in dead months to draw customers. The vendor can also offer a suitable promotional item, ideally suited to the prevailing situation, to make the event more attractive and to encourage more visitors.  Take the advantage of this lull to redesign the store. Customers who patronised the store will appreciate and admire a brand new set up and a livelier outlook. You do not have to be a creative designer to introduce novel decorations or arrangements to the store. Simple things such as shifting furniture, changing wall colours, adding flower pots and so forth will be sufficient.  As you had been in business in the location previously, you have a good understanding about the general behaviour of customers. The public in general are looking for novelty after a strenuous period in time. Hence, you can take the full advantage as a smart retailer to increase patronage.    As you have already suffered due to the public panic and the long closure, a simple short term financial plan must be   devised to overcome the immediate concern. President Rajapaksa has already ordered many useful financial concessions through Banks and other financial institutions and other packages to the benefit of small and medium size businesses. This is a terrific consolation to businessmen of all sizes. Retailers can make the maximum use of these facilities, concessions and special considerations offered by the Government. In addition, there are other programs planned by the Government that can be of assistance. Hence, it’s good to be vigilant about all related state aid projects which will be in place to combat the economic issues when the pandemic threat is over.         Renegotiating the rate with your merchandise suppliers under the new situation is a good idea. Retailers must remember that they are also affected and looking forward to re-establish themselves. Therefore, treat this as an opportunity to renew the prices where you can pass on a part of the additional benefits to your own buyers, if you succeed. In a similar tone, the retailer may strike a bargain with the service providers for equipment rentals, store rent, insurance premiums and janitorial fees to reduce costs of operation. In Sri Lanka, employers do not lay off workers in a situation such as this, as is done in many so called developed countries.Therefore, an attempt must be made to use the workers  to participate in something productive from home, to be used when the locked down period is over. Of course, you can discuss and get their opinion to cut costs temporarily to survive with shared burden. No employee would want to leave a job at this juncture as work is scarce in this crisis. Hence, reasonable adjustments also can be made with the existing staff.   Coronavirus is a global crisis and the whole world will most likely be plunged into a recession. Therefore, all retailers must be mindful that the best weapon to win this battle is to focus on the future.Your preparations and planning for the immediate future is utterly important to make the fastest recovery. Contribution of every business entity, big or small, will decide how fast the already ailing economy can be placed back on its feet. Particularly, this contribution is vital at this crucial time where the economy is almost at the bottom of the pit with failed past few years with awfully low growth rate and the Government is struggling to make the ends together. "
5 May 2019,Sri Lanka to expand exports to Central Europe,"Sri Lanka is exploring opportunities in new export markets for opportunities immediately as well as in the long run.The Export Development Board has identified the Central European region as a potential market.The potential of Central Europe remains largely untapped. The Region is open for business and attractive for long-term growth prospects. Although Sri Lanka has a strong image in the region, its commercial engagement has been relatively limited.Sri Lanka’s total bilateral trade with Central European countries was $ 810 million last year with exports to Central Europe being $ 388 million and imports $ 422 million.But these figures do not tell the entire story as it contains Sri Lanka’s healthy trade relations with only a few countries such as Poland and Hungary.The EDB recently organised a trade mission to Central Europe covering Hungary and Poland. This was parallel to the first session of the Sri Lanka-Hungary Joint Commission in Budapest, Hungary.Sri Lanka looks at Central Europe primarily as a market for our strategic industries. Sri Lanka exports tea, apparel, manufactured tobacco, rubber finished products, electrical and electronic products, coconut fibre, coconut kernel products, edible fish products, transport equipment and parts, coconut shell products, parts of footwear, spices, essential oils and oleoresins and processed food to the Central European region.Recently, the EU launched its Europe-Asia connectivity strategy. It is important that Sri Lanka should look beyond the largest EU states of Western Europe and use the potential of cooperation in the Central European countries which complies with the uniform market rules which apply throughout the EU.Sri Lanka and Central European countries have much to offer to each other.They have stable macro-economic environment, highly educated, yet affordable workforce, favourable business environment and strategic location.Geed Technologies, Bio Foods, Vintage Teas, Siddalepa Exports, Serendipol, Jetwing and Sen Wellness Sanctuary participated in the Business Forum followed by the B2B meetings from April 23 to 26 in Hungary and Poland.They had the added advantage of joining the official delegation to the Joint Commission which initially provided an opportunity to organise this mission.The business forum and B2B meetings in Hungary was organised by the Hungarian Export Promotion Agency (HEPA) and the Hungarian Embassy in New Delhi. The event was attended by the Co-Chairs of the Joint Commission; representing Sri Lanka, Secretary of the Ministry of Development Strategy and International Trade and István Joó, Deputy State Secretary for Export Development of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary. This event was coordinated by the Commercial secretary of Hungarian Embassy in New Delhi, Szolt Padazky.Over 45 Hungarian companies attended the forum and over 30 B2B meetings were conducted. "

20 June 2021,Prepare your business for the unexpected,"Let’s do a rundown of what businesses have learned from the pandemic.Pandemic goes on with no time horizon to end it. The world has changed dramatically. For most of us, this may be the first crisis of this magnitude we have faced while we all have had ups and downs in business over the years.Whether it’s the first time or not we all have to confront this issue alike. The impact was immediate for some companies, slower for others, but none of us can say that Covid-19 did not have an impact at all except telecommunication, delivery services and medical that naturally expanded the markets by default.None of us imagined two year ago what we would have to face in a few months time. With all the knowledge the world has – we do not even have a vaccination that guards us fully from the risk. So we do not see the light at the end of the tunnel yet. We may have to live this life and operate our business for a longer period than we wish.Prior to the Covid-19 breakout, none of us imagined our everyday work to be done mostly or completely online, from home. None of us imagined that we would exclusively have online meetings, online calls, online events, online training, online campaigns and so on. None of us imagined we could do business without travelling. The realisation offers many business lessons in terms of optimising resources - remove fat – extra ordinary efficiencies.Ultimately in business the forced situation helped optimise our work flows and businesses to be more efficient.Businesses from various areas were terribly damaged. The lockdowns shut down the entire hospitality industry. Travelling outside the country was forbidden. Airports were almost empty. Everything happened almost overnight. A large part of every economy stopped. Export oriented economies found markets crashing. Supply chain networks crippled at least in the short term.Given all these factors, most companies had to make decisions quickly: employee safety was first on the list, so most of them had to act fast regarding remote working programs. Software companies and those selling digital goods were among the luckiest ones. Most of them already had programs for remote work, but had to quickly extend them to all their employees for a longer period of time.The business should go on. Companies needed to assure themselves that revenues wouldn’t plummet. So, they had to assess their strengths and weaknesses in this totally new situation, change procedures, processes and workflows, create new products or even reinvent themselves—and do all of this as fast as possible to sustain cash-flows .In a post-Covid world, companies have, therefore, learned that it always helps to be prepared for the unexpected. If not all of us were working with contingency or crisis plans prior to 2020, businesses now understand they have to have these flows ready, for when situations of force majeure occur.SafetyEmployees’ and customers’ safety comes first. This is fairly easy to manage if you follow sanitation guidelines, and online businesses can consider themselves lucky. But, even so, all the measures you have to take can put some pressure on your company’s finances. Finding a way to get most of your employees to work from home, in a safe way, might mean that you have to instantly spend lakhs of rupees on acquiring laptops, webcams and headphones, or pay a large subscription for a good video conferencing solution.The next priority, during such a crisis, is survival of the business. As most businesses were impacted by Covid-19, they had to quickly readjust and find out what products or services are more profitable, what channels get more customers, what campaigns get more leads and so on. The activity, product or service that delivers less profit should be put on hold for the moment.The priority is to get your business into a better shape day-by-day. Make a quick assessment of development plans. Focus on those that can offer your company a quick advantage over your competitors. Now, more than ever, businesses understand that not all directions they’re pursuing are priorities, and many are deciding to shift focus and resources to areas with the most resilience and revenue potential.Reinvent yourselfLot of companies have had to reinvent themselves in various ways: find new channels to interact with the customers, find new market opportunities, create new products to address new needs, modify their manufacturing facilities, find new selling channels or think of new campaigns and promotions to cope with declining sales. The pandemic was the trigger that got entrepreneurs understanding that they have to employ creativity and differentiation in everything they do, forcing businesses to get out of their comfort zone. If you are a company providing cleaning services, logically no property management company needs you until the people get back to offices. Worse, people may not accept you in their homes anymore until this pandemic is over. So, you have to reinvent your entire business. One option is to turn from cleaning to sanitising and try to find clients in retail and healthcare.If you produce cosmetics, you can produce hand sanitisers. If you are in the fashion business, maybe you should focus on manufacturing facemasks with style and sell them online. There are many ways for businesses to reinvent themselves.A good example of reinventing oneself comes from the event industry.Live entertainment took a hit like few other industries when the pandemic started, social distancing forcing organisers to cancel upcoming concerts, theatre shows, on-premise workshops, weddings, networking sessions, you name it. Some players in this industry, however, were quick to jump out of their comfort zone.By adapting their portfolios and focusing on building online experiences and events, they retained parts of their markets. Instead of inviting audiences to an indoor or outdoor venue, they started working with online conference rooms or digital hangouts. These companies understood that the market context offered the opportunity to address new needs so they reinvented themselves to stay relevant to their audiences.Permanent changesThe Covid-19 crisis not impacted only specific industries. We could say it has brought permanent changes to how all of us do business nowadays. For example, think back to how a B2B sales process would occur in the past. Now consider today’s context – are those flows still applicable? The pandemic arrived and re-shaped the selling process in all industries and markets. Physical touch-points had to be adapted and automated, and entrepreneurs large and small had to digitise and optimise their selling flows.So, a crisis lesson many us had to learn the hard way is that an online presence and point of sale are mandatory for any commerce provider today.One big positive for business organisations and employees is that when pushed against the wall - you are forced to perform the impossible. Some changes you have made or are experiencing may have been big dreams in the normal world – but in the new normal world very same activities have become possible. Those who decide to incorporate those changes into the system for the long term will be better placed to win the ‘next normal world’."
16 February 2020,Entrepreneurship development is vital for the economy,"Entrepreneur is defined in the Cambridge Dictionary as someone who starts his own business, especially when this involves a new opportunity. Among other definitions, I chose this definition because of its suitability to Sri Lankan business culture.As per the records of the Statistics Department, micro, small and medium scale enterprise distribution is over a million, with over three million workers engaged in it. Almost all establishments in these categories operate as sole ownership or partnership businesses.These establishments make an enormous contribution to the economy. Most of the micro level businesses are not legally registered while small and medium scale enterprises are either incorporated or functioning as legal sole proprietorship or partnership basis.In my long experience in the private sector, I have come across hundreds of business owners who started business taking financial risks by seeing opportunities.However, the notable fact is that most of these usually intelligent and hard working risk takers who are not afraid to take bold decisions, are not adequately knowledgeable about the theoretical, technical or applied process of entrepreneurship or management. Hence, there is a substantial gap between their natural business acumen and the conceptual knowledge they possess.I have stumbled upon medium scale entrepreneurs who own successful business operations with a work force of hundreds, who solely depend on their business instincts.If they make an effort to learn and gain knowledge about management practices, they would be in a much better situation in business. Typically, these businessmen who are successful most of the time ignore intellectual advice. They are their own bosses, set their own goals, control their own progress and run their business how they see fit. They deal with their own success or failure and view it as their own burden and responsibility.Through his manifesto, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa indicated that his vision is to create an economy driven by young entrepreneurs and provide extensive opportunities and incentives. He states that Youth Entrepreneur Counselling Centres will be set up to provide integrated services in entrepreneurial learning covering theoretical, technical and scientific processes. A national youth fund will also be set up with an initial allocation of a billion rupees provided by the Treasury.This is great news and a golden opportunity for youngsters looking forward to start on their own. They will have two very important and compulsory factors to commence a business entity. Those selected initially will receive capital contribution from the Government and subsequently technical assistance, such as management knowledge and identifying opportunities.Entrepreneurial development has become an extremely vital factor; in view of it being a key feature of economic development.Therefore, entrepreneurs have become the seeds of development to provide greater employment opportunities, increase per capita income and revenue to the Government by way of taxes and other levies. Entrepreneurship development is carried out to increase the number of potential future entrepreneurs and to improve the knowledge of entrepreneurs through a process of improving skills and knowledge business owners through awareness campaigns and if possible through training programs.In the current context, encouraging large numbers of micro, small and medium scale business owners to understand the importance of structured knowledge must be done to enhance the current productivity levels.There are over a million entrepreneurs at various success or failure levels in the three segments. They need motivation to realise that their business entities will be in better shape if the processes are more organised.As most of them are ego-driven profit centered individuals, they can be persuaded to learn the scientific aspect of entrepreneurship.To attract existing businessmen, a well structured and properly designed policy with clear objectives is needed. An awareness program to make them understand the future potential of learning must be made available.The Government, fortunately, has realised the weight of this important issue which was neglected up to now. The impact certainly will be immense and in general improvement of the current vast number of small and medium business will provide more employment and contribute more to the economy.Government policy usually has a substantial impact on entrepreneurs. Despite some promises made previously, no Government had specific policies or programs to effectively support entrepreneurial businesses. Therefore, creating an effective policy on entrepreneur development is essential under the guidance of a creative and knowledgeable team. "

23 July 2017,Informatics holds Big Data Analytics Open Forum,"The Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), a pioneer in providing IT and Business higher education in Sri Lanka, held the Big Data Analytics Open Forum at The Mirage, Colombo recently.The event was attended by IT and corporate professionals who represented several renowned multinational and local blue-chip companies. The Open Forum discussed the uses of Big Data, Business Analytics and Business Intelligence tools to empower organizations to achieve success.The event was addressed by CEO of IIT, Dr. Sampath Kannangara, Professor of Intelligent Systems Research for Robert Gordon University, UK, Prof. Nirmalie Wiratunge, Senior Lecturer /Course Leader at IIT, Cassim Farook and Senior Lecturer and Course Coordinatorat IIT,Alroy Mascranghe.Dr. Nirmalie Wiratunga said that Big Data is a popular topic which has gained much attention and is of strategic importance to Robert Gordon University and Scotland.CEO of IIT, Dr. Sampath Kannangara said, “IIT is a pioneer in providing internationally renowned undergraduate and postgraduate programs. Over the years we focused on producing all-round graduates that are able to empower their respective organizations.”“IIT graduates are in high demand in the Government and Corporate sectors mainly due to our focus on catering to the industry needs. The postgraduate degree programs offered at IIT will enhance knowledge and provide the students with the necessary skill sets that is required to excel in their chosen career,” he said.“The specialized masters programs offered at IIT in collaboration with globally renowned universities will definitely give our graduates a competitive edge,” Kannangara said.Alroy Mascrenghe speaking on the topic of Business Analytics said, “What is Business Analytics? Everyone is talking about it these days. It is simply turning data into insight. Netflix has a lot of subscribers as well as data. After further investigation into the types of TV shows that subscribers prefer to watch, they found a relationship between specific pairings of TV shows and they went onto produce the American version of House of Cards which was a huge success.”“Another heavily used example in business analytics is on pampers and beer. A famous supermarket wanted to get an idea of the products customer like to buy together when they shop at the grocery store and they found a very unusual pairing which was pampers and beer. They put these products next to each other and even gave a promotion on these two products together and the sales increased by a vast amount,” he said.Senior lecturer Cassim Farook said that Big Data Analytics is targeted towards a tech savvy, R&D and research oriented architects, solution designers, implementers and engineers.He said that the MSc Big Data Analytics offered at IIT will provide students following the programme an in-depth knowledge on technologies and tools that will give rise to efficient Big Data Analytics solutions."
11 July 2021,Build a new team to win Covid challenge,"We have seen how employees have responded to the Covid-19 business challenge. Some have struggled; some have been hopeless not taking any risks or accountability but some have responded above and beyond expectations.It would be good for you to make structural and management changes to get the best out of those who rose effectively to the challenge. You need them to continue to lead the pack as Covid-19 continues for an indefinite time as we read the situation today. If you do not use your people assessment in the given environment, your business will be unable to sustain and grow.As leaders, you need to make the right move now. However, given the inherent culture, laid back practices and habits of Sri Lankan leaders across different fields, it’s fair to say that most Sri Lankan leaders are at the two extreme ends; either too nice or too bossy.Both have their specific pros and cons. You would agree that there are more cons than pros. It doesn’t work in today’s environment especially when the markets are very volatile and need people to take risks and work under tough conditions.The varying performance environment and the mindset of people demand that you keep moving on the axis to improve organisational performance by ‘’ mix and match’’ theory. This is both an art and science that need to be developed in leaders across all levels. Recognise exceptional behaviourEmployees may have made numerous sacrifices during the Covid-19 stricken period. Have you formally appreciated it? Appreciation does not mean that one should accept everything and everybody and be inauthentic about it due to your hesitance to differentiate performance. Be bold. Inauthentic and misaligned appreciation is picked up very quickly by the employees and it damages relationships instead of building a new team for the future. Authentic appreciation, on the other hand, motivates people to go beyond their own limits – do the impossible with or without Covid.It’s about taking a genuine interest and recognising people and the business for well balanced and sustainable accountability. Those who made sacrifices – took risks and continued to perform under uncertain parameters would expect respect in return.You look around; we have some leaders in every field who get fun out of finding fault and fault only. This has to change. Appreciating a person boosts their morale and makes them feel good that somebody is paying attention to them and hence they continue to do what brought them appreciation in the first place. Unfortunately, most often, we grow up discovering our limits by being told what not to do and what doesn’t work more than being encouraged to explore what is possible. We have to ‘unlearn’ our patterns of identifying what does not work and intentionally concentrate on appreciating what works however small that may be. I can only appreciate others to the extent that I appreciate myself. So appreciation is also about self acceptance.We rarely appreciate who we are and what we receive because of our conditioned expectations. It is possible for us to come from an attitude of ‘never enough’ and such an attitude is quite transparent to others even though we might be blind to it ourselves. Stretch beyond your limitsMost people are quite comfortable with who they are and what they got and never explore beyond their own comfort zones. In such cases, they may never discover their real capacity and depend on others to tell what their boundaries are and do not participate in anything that makes them uncomfortable.We can operate as catalysts with each other to identify our self-imposed limits and examine the appropriateness of those limits in the current context. Curiosity, collaboration, empathy, and appreciation provide the impetus for people to engage in an activity that is personally challenging and, hopefully, discover their own untapped potential. Such exploration can only be done in supportive environments and appreciative relationships. While nobody can change anybody else, an empathetic, appreciative person who is aware of his circumstances will definitely make him think again about his mindset and he would be willing to stretch a bit beyond his own comfort zone to explore what is out there. You know the outcome that can be achieved; so go for it.Future is not going to be any easier. You need the best people leading the pack. So make changes now and allow those who can perform under tough conditions  internally and externally to take the business forward. So others would emulate that would create a tougher team for tougher conditions for more sweeter results.  "
18 April 2021,Digitisation and modernising trade business and consumerism for the citizen,"The World is fast changing despite the dangerous Covid-19 pandemic, leading Sri Lanka towards success through education on Vistas of prosperity and spender in order to digitalise the system and modernise the natural knowledge based on human capital to suit the 21st century on the theme ’Towards a perfect education that enriches wisdom and experiment’ on steps taken by the program and vision of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.Introducing new platforms and programs coupled with education, development and other subjects including trade and international issues- a leap frog from this program for the future.It is salutary news that Sri Lanka is keeping pace with the modern developments even during the festive season easing citizens pressurised with pandemic and economic hardships due to economic downturns around the world. It is indeed salutary that digitalisation and modern international platforms are utilised in combating ‘Covid-19’ and development strategies including in agriculture which is the topic of the article today.The festive season and prices of consumer itemsThe festive season is here and the talk of the town is the prices of consumer items and the legal framework which has not still been settled on trade, business, competition and prices of items in demand.There was a news item by Minister Bandula Gunawardena that the Consumer Protection Act of 1979 will be amended when in fact it is repealed by the Consumer Affairs Authority Act no 9 of 2003, on March 17 2003 with other existing legislation amalgamating the current act which is a combination of Australian, Canadian modelled system with basic English principles partly embodied in the act and not a properly effective piece of legislation in action today.It is the duty of officials to brief the Minister on updates on legislature when making such important public statements which are the basis of current and future changes on legislature, when the Minister again claims to change current old and outdated legal structure to be proactive, modern and applicable for the current developments.The Minister has quite correctly stated that the current legislation is outdated and is a ’toothless lion’ needing drastic changes and vigour with modern changes on the digital age with new international platforms and developments in line with the changes happening world over.Act No 9 of 2003 changed the existing pattern and structure of successful concept of price control still in force in the United Kingdom to the current system of regulations of trade also based on competition law and modern commercial law concepts, which has not yet been understood by successive regimes that attempted to implement the concept introduced by Lalith Athulathmudali, then Minister of Trade who introduced the legislation with the best of intentions which was unfortunately unsuccessful on implementation.Undisputedly, change of the CAA Act is badly needed and the CAA during successive Chairmen have attempted to do so with no success.Drastic changes necessaryThis is not the time for immediate major changes of the law, and the best is to give time for a complete and comprehensive study in the law and practice with international trade and developments which are now interwoven. What is news today is the controversy over coconut oil, paddy and rice prices, alleged sugar scam, and rising cost of living due to price rise of every consumer item that CAA has miserably failed to answer.How the price structure operates in Sri Lanka is very interesting. Trader can sell at any reasonable price provided if it is of good quality and of quality health standards in order to provide the price mark is exhibited on the show room cage for the citizen to clearly see, whereas under the previous legislation control of prices Act 173 (which is repealed) price mark was strictly adhered to on conditions on price control legislation with price control system.Then what is the maximum price? In the current price regime and the fluctuation of the prices of paddy, rice, sugar, coconut etc are issues confronted by the consumer which is bit hard to understand to follow. It is operative under S/18 of the act when the Minister and the Authority can determine the wholesale and retail price if the consumer item by a Gazette notification with the condition of 18(2).No manufacturer or trader shall increase the retail for wholesale price of any goods of and services specified under subsection (1) except with the prior written approval of the authority. This is not effective or straight as the price control procedure which is working well in UK which is repealed here in 1979.Attempts have been made to change the consumer law on previous occasions and today we have to be extra cautious due to the modern trends, introduction of new international platforms and changes due to digitalisation process which is ever growing with the mobile penetration of 100 per cent of the population and the developments on the knowledge an practice on learning when village children climbed water tanks for WIFI and the villager got used to WhatsApp for the payment of water and electricity bills through the network of computer centres at every junction.A good trend ever increasing indeed! We have to take note of all international trends and changes in framing if any legislation or rules on consumerism in future, School teachers conducted online classes with the help of their computer literate children - our future scientists.No end to Covid- 19 soonCovid-19 has changed the entire marketing developments and life of the ordinary citizen including students and the working class. There is no guarantee that the Covid-19 will end or a timeframe to end thereby we have to live on hopes and be prepared for any eventuality, so that future planning is near impossible.Sri Lankans proved themselves to be adoptable to any adverse conditions or situations when facing Covid- 19 and hardships as consumers. Prices of consumer items are going up with it in addition to many other considerations which effects the consumer in all fronts, with food being the main consideration.Food that is available should be reasonably priced and of quality as required by Section 7 (a) (b) (c) and (d) which states that it is the duty of the Authority to see that consumer is provided with goods and services not hazardous to the consumers (Section 4) protect against unfair trade practices, adequate access to goods and provide redress against exploitation.All this has to be implemented by regulatory powers in part two of the Act. Anti-competitive practices are dealt with in the Consumer Affairs Council also engaged in research and procedure on air trade practices.Covid- 19 also has melded the attitudes of the citizen with better relations with the trader consumer, and the regulator, for the trader and industrialist to be fair and the consumer to be smart, sharp and careful to have the ideal combination of fair trader, alert consumer and able regulator.The consumer must change his/her attitude to be simple and smart to ascertain a) when to purchase, b) where to purchase and how to purchase items available. Consumer items to be purchased with required quantities and well planned for the day or week giving priority to health and quality.Fruits should not be purchased from long term stalls and imported fruits and vegetables should be avoided when we have such great verities, for example Banana in UK has only one variety which is available with not much taste when we have so many varietes at very reasonable of taste and quality.Fresh vegetables and fruits could be purchased cheap in markets. Cola should not be consumed at any cost, which is poisons and expensive. Why consume bottled water in plastics bottles which can be poisonous and unhealthy, when we can have boiled and cold water in glass bottles which is cheap and healthy.When you purchase consumer items it is worthy to note the best would be Sathosa. When non-perishables can be stored and it is a good idea for the family to plan out the week or month as an exercise to save and be healthy. During online purchase can be practiced which can extended to clothes and other consumer items for convenience and safety.Now that the entire lifestyle has changed due to Covid-19, it is time to be prepared to go through it for an unspecified period with changes of future plans. Needless to state that all precautionary measures are to be followed to the last word for a long-term solution and a healthy, stable and happy life with the family.Bogus sales, congestion and presents to familyThe consumer should be aware of rights, duties and the expectations from the trader and the industrialist. It is the duty of the trader to give the consumer dignity, quality goods, and services at a reasonable price indicated on the rack or the showcase.The consumer has the right to complain to the CAA or a branch office which you will have access form 1919 system, or personal complain to the CAA office or a branch.Telephone and written complaints are accepted and the CAA is prompt on complaints by the consumer who the CAA and the trader considers as top priority.Consumer need not be hesitant to question or complain and it can be done in a friendly manner as it is your right to do so. Bogus sales are plenty and the consumer should use common sense in purchasing very cheap items with hidden charges.It is advisable to take your own time in selecting the goods as it is your money that you are parting with. Consumer should know the basic needs, rights and duties and expectations from the trader to be a satisfied consumer.When you purchase electric and electronic items one should be careful of the make, quality and the condition you may not be conversant with when you have to be careful on the warranty documents/cards and specially the paragraphs in small letters in a language not known to you.It is advisable to demand for a receipt for which you are entitled to and you can request more details on the receipt. Some traders will encourage you to give on credit on hire purchase schemes, and you should be careful in signing documents on conditions with small letters or in a language not known to you, and giving your personal information.It is advisable to seek the advice of a known family member generally conversant with trade practices. Always ask for the visiting card and other details of the trader and trading names with contact numbers. It is a joint effort of trader, consumer, regulator, and industrialist for a better consumer regime and a fair-trading regime.Especially during the festive season be extremely careful of the 8000 drug addicts on the road in Colombo waiting for preys which can be dangerous. Always be in touch with security forces and loved ones during exposure to the traders and public.Quality of consumer items and consumer organisationsThe trader is bound to give items of quality to the consumer and finding the quality is always an issue unless it is tested by the standard bureau or tests by a group of consumers.It is imperative for the consumers to be a member of one or more consumer organisations which is very forceful in other parts of the world. In the United Kingdom, the consumer organisations are very powerful and the trader is obliged to be consumer friendly based on the famous adage that consumer does no wrong and always correct.Consumer Affairs Authority is expected to assist, monitor and encourage consumer organisations as powerful groups though less powerful compared to UK and other parts of the world.Then what about the rice prices, adulterated coconut oil, consumer items of inferior quality, and hiding a storing the consumer items refusing to sale are offence for prosecution.In UK and the West, the returned items are accepted but sadly not in Sri Lanka, when you can exchange it and when you need to change or return. Consumer organisations should agitate for this right with the help of CAA.Modern trends on trade practicesThe quality of goods, services of food and consumer items are substandard, and of inferior quality due to lack of supervision and regulation by the CAA and other regulators such as TRCEL insurance, and Trade Ombudsman, public health inspectors, local councils, health department, and many statutory bodies.With advancement of technology Sri Lankans are at the doorsteps of digitalisation with mobile phones in everybody’s hand (100 percent of the population) and computer literacy of 40 percent that is ever increasing? Younger generation is now armed with excellent computer skills and able to use credit cards, advanced banking methods, and engaged in modern technology via face book and other social media platforms for day-to-day office with computer centres at every corner on the road used by the adults.However, in Sri Lanka online shopping is not practiced often as in the United Kingdom where 40 per cent of the consumer items are purchased online when the practice is being fast used in Sri Lanka too.Sri Lanka appears to be ready for a leap frog with the advanced applicability of modern technology and day to day transactions and day will not be too far when the majority of the population makes its purchases online.‘Uber’ a worldwide digital application is catering to millions of people worldwide including Sri Lanka. These technologies are expanding to blow drying to food chains when majority of consumer population purchases online.‘Uber’ - a main digital application catering to millions of customers worldwide including Sri Lanka these techs are expanding to bring blow drying and food items to door steps which will revolutionise online purchasing further.Digitalisation of education has commenced by setting digital classrooms which equips students and teachers with laptops and tabs. How do you make digital regimes fairer in Sri Lanka with outdated regulator CAA with fast developments on technology? We watched on the television an impressive digital classroom at ‘Thurstan College’ and we understand the trend is fast spreading. Are we in the digital age or in the door steps are the issues to be resolved today.Digitalisation in the world is fast spreading with adverse effects shedding billions of jobs with no strategy from the state and the leaders of the private sector to find alternate arrangements to use them as innovators as in Israel.The digital marketplaces are thriving in the West which has a foothold in Sri Lanka and the potential is very interestingly limited changes of lifestyles due to innovative changes making life easier. However, these changes include the risk of health other unexpected and undesirable changes in the economy.Will Sri Lanka be affected by the ripple effect or to what extent it will invade Sri Lanka is a matter of time Digitalisation developments depend on the vision considering the mobile and internet user are young.Experts predict saturated digital market in Sri Lanka in 10 years with innovative smart cities in line with Israel Hong Kong and UAE when 40 percent of the global population is online with 750 million global internet users, Sri Lanka will be finding it difficult to join the world out of necessity ad compulsion. Chinese multinational company ‘Alibaba’ started by an English Teacher in Hangzhou is the biggest retailer with 100 British brands and with 440 million active clients which is also protected by the UK government could be considered as a guide line for our digital introduction.It is time to encourage and promote our young entrepreneurs with the vision in the Israel youth on innovation taking them up to the world standards on innovation.Dhammika Perera, who is supposed to be the richest man in Sri Lanka who bought ‘Singer’ recently said in Colombo that he has increased the business of Singer by 38 percent after taking over and introducing online business and has observed that online trend was settling to a mixture of online and storage stores worldwide, again indicating the uncertainty of world business trends at successive speed.Challenges and way forwardDigitalisation, modernisation, trade and consumerism are interconnected and interwoven with one another in the present context, connected and depending on each other. Trade and consumerism is a part and parcel of the life and digitalisation and modernisation are complementary.The world is ever changing with challenges, especially with Covid-19 pandemic when village bravely faced by using WhatsApp to make payments, children climbed water tanks for WIFI and teachers were guided and trained by children for distance teaching on line are proof that Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans are adoptable to any challenges.Invasion of international digital platforms to Sri Lanka is inevitable and we have to be ready to accept and meet challenges without changing ourselves culturally and age-old traditions and habits we lived with.Consumerism is not an alien concept to us when we had the Badulla ‘TAM’ in 1857 AD, with instructions to the consumer and trader along with other 4000 ’TAMS’ found on excavations, to show our past glory and education on the subject.Therefore, it is time for us to give and interpret the correct meaning on consumerism to have the balancing livelihood of consumer, trader, regulator and the industrialist, in return the citizen to be happy and contended.[email protected]The writer is the former Chairman Consumer Affairs Authority, President’s Counsel, former Ambassador to UAE and Israel, President Ambassadors’ Forum"
5 July 2020,Change business model to align with new normal world,"The Covid-19 pandemic has forced many business models to change and some were made completely obsolete – willingly or unwillingly the change was the only way to survive during the lockdown and immediately thereafter.Now that the environment is becoming somewhat normal, it’s important that you make a strategic decision on the business model to take it forward.A business model is a framework to systematically unlock medium to long-term value for an organisation while offering the right value proposition to customers and capturing value through business strategies to achieve objectives – it’s how you connect all your key stakeholders and run your business for profit.It’s a holistic framework to understand, design, and test your business assumptions in the marketplace.A business model is a more effective way to compete because it is hard for competitors to copy a business model but relatively easy to copy a product or service. The importance of the business model cannot be underestimated especially in the new normal world.Today, any business can be put into three buckets; those that have had tough times, those that are having tough times and those that are going to have tough times. Generally tough times relate to poor revenue and profits due to multiple issues that you control and do not directly control. Yet, you need to figure out a way to survive. The environment is very tough and it’s impossible to deliver results in the given environment. In the middle of a tough time it is very natural to start freaking out based on ‘what could be’ as opposed to ‘what actually is’.Rethink your businessIt is imperative to do the right analysis around what is going on and to only deal with facts, regardless of what is going on in your head. The people who are responsible for performance will always amplify the issues or interpret them to their advantage and link unrelated developments to find refuge for their poor focus, skills and application.Tough times are crossroads in your business and they provide an opportunity to make hard decisions about what is working and what is not. This is the perfect time to stop and really reflect on your business fundamentals and make the changes that deep down you know you need to make.This can be such a cliché but it is true. Check the business fundamentals and ask the question as to what fundamentals you believed in are not working anymore despite your persistent attempts?Markets contract for any product that’s old and customers moving towards alternatives, and competitors matching your value proposition. Your supply chain strategy may no longer offer the targeted cost savings to be competitive in price to the customer. Your competitors may have figured out more cost effective supplies with external developments globally or locally favouring their business model.Your physical distribution model may no longer make sense with customer buying habits changing. These issues are not new in the business world but in the fast paced world you operate in, business models have a short life.Not all issues can be tackled through operational strategy and execution effectiveness. Complete overhaul is necessary to stay relevant to the customer and to build new competitive advantages.A successful business model represents a better way than existing alternatives to achieve improved business results. Creating a new business model is like writing a new story. At some level, all new stories are variations of old ones. Similarly, all new business models are variations of the generic value chain underlying all businesses.Broadly speaking, this chain has two parts. Part one includes all the activities associated with making something: designing it, purchasing raw materials and manufacturing.Part two includes all the activities associated with selling something: finding and reaching customers, transacting a sale, distributing the product or delivering the service. A new business model’s plot may turn on designing a new product for an unmet need. Or it may turn on a process innovation, a better way of making or selling or distributing an already proved product or service.Don’t be biased towards the existing model.Be it in business or anything else humans do, when what you are doing isn’t working, having tried all options available with all your heart and energy, it makes sense to try something new and different.This sounds logical, yet I have watched so many businesses slowly go bust simply because they kept doing the same thing, right to the end. Many talk about the Kodak example but leave that aside, in Sri Lanka we have many examples from apparel brands to spice grinding.One time business giants and household names we thought will never ‘die’ due to strong value and bond, have collapsed offering good management learning. Never allow your business to look old. Continue to invest in your business.It is time to give the outside a coat of paint, upgrade the showrooms, come up with a new identity and corporate image, train and motivate your staff, invest in new technology and anything else that will make your business look more impressive and run more impressively.Changing your business model can be a tough decision to make, but it’s crucial for some businesses that have failed continuously. Or it can even be a successful business model delivering good results but yet a change in the business model can take you further, faster.In the new normal world, unless you get the business model alignment, doing anything else well might not get you anywhere. "
12 July 2020, Covid-19 and employee gratitude to the employer,"The Covid-19 pandemic led to many acid tests with one being how employers value employees.‘People are our biggest asset’ is a phrase used by almost all employers and yet how many practise this? We saw a large percentage of big and very profitable companies including large conglomerates reducing salaries up to 50% and some employees asked to stay at home without any pay.Contrary to this, we saw small and medium size business organisations practising the said phrase by not reducing salaries. This is an eye opener for many stakeholders. Employees of those companies which treated employees as their biggest asset should now reciprocate by giving their maximum for the growth of the organisation.  We all think that we’re important in other people’s lives. We want to be noticed, valued, respected and rewarded - and ponder about it day-in and day-out. Our whole focus is on ‘what’s in it for me’. Well, you deserve what you deserve. At the same time, as employees we have obligations to the employer as well. The ‘give and take’ policy applies in its true spirit to ‘employer–employee relationships’ too.Gratitude is at the core of all healthy partnerships. You must also understand the difficulties and objectives of your employer, and then do the work you are being paid to do with honesty. Fulfill all your job responsibilities with a ‘sincere heart’ – I repeat with a ‘sincere heart’.You have workplace rights – rightly so, but at the same time you have to do your job meeting expectations and respect your leaders’ vision — as in showing them consideration for their effort to keep the team intact and motivated for results that benefit all.How about showing a little love and empathy to your employer? You may ask - What? The same people who gave me no or a very small salary increase this year and laid off my buddies? We are all too quick to go for the negative aspects of working in these tough times. But how about one single reason to be grateful - you have a job and a guaranteed income.The majority of employees would never say they earn enough or are paid well – that’s nature. But mind you many are not lucky to have a job like you. It’s important to check both sides of the coin before you express your feelings and pass judgments. It’s your contribution that will make the business grow. You have to first give and take back your share later.Contribute proactivelyVolunteer for an important value creating project by your colleagues in another department. Maybe it’s not an interesting or resume-enhancing one, but it will help your bosses to sustain your benefit package or even enhance it. Work overtime or sacrifice a few hours during weekends if necessary without any expectations of acknowledgement or future compensation.Ask yourself – have you not rejected such small extra contributions for the betterment of the organisation? How many times have you engaged in such activities wholeheartedly? You should train yourself to see the end result of your extra voluntary efforts.Give reasons to your bosses to recognise and reward you. Don’t blame them if they have read you right and placed you where they think you should be.After all, your bosses have  feelings similar to what you have and they need inspiration and motivation.How have you shown your employer/boss your gratitude lately? Your employer takes ultimate responsibility to pay you regardless of whether the company has made profits or not. Your employer gives you the security of a regular income and annual benefit package you can plan and depend on.Your employer takes the hit when there is an economic collapse or slowdown, the dollar rises or falls, fluctuating interest rates or some other business sensitive market situation arises. Your employer deals with bitter and prohibitive regulations and legislation that negatively impact the business, pays high taxes and duties and makes various other contributions to the economy that helps your country men to have a decent quality of life.You get to go on holiday with your family and leave the business behind – isn’t this guaranteed. Most of all you can leave the organisation for better prospects or for any personal reasons.  How good is that? Have we ever tried to understand or comprehend the value of our employer and extended gratitude in whatever form or shape to say thank you and also feel good about the attitude of gratitude which all good human beings should nurture and respect.HappinessCultivating gratitude is one of the simpler routes to a greater sense of emotional well-being, higher overall life satisfaction, and a greater sense of happiness in life. People with a greater level of gratitude have strong relationships in that they appreciate their loved ones more and their loved ones, feeling that appreciation, do more to earn it.And because those who are happier, sleep better and enjoy healthy relationships - grateful people are healthier people. Fortunately, gratitude can be cultivated, and this can be accomplished in several ways.For the next few weeks, try some of ways of and exercise good examples of gratitude you get exposed to, and you will notice a significant increase in your feelings of gratitude -— you will likely find yourself noticing more positive things in your life, dwelling less on negative or stressful events and feelings of rejection and having a greater sense of appreciation for the people and things in your life.To start with when you notice yourself grumbling about a negative event or stressor in your work life, try to think of four or five related things for which you are grateful. Learn from others who are better than you – never benchmark with colleagues who do not demonstrate the ideal behaviour and attitude. Know that your bosses know to compare the right way. You cannot hide – you are exposed, which has its own merits and demerits.Many people cause themselves unnecessary stress by making comparisons. More specifically, they cause themselves stress by making the wrong comparisons. They compare themselves only to those who have more, do more, or are in some way closer to their ideals, and allow themselves to feel inferior instead of being inspired.In cultivating gratitude, you have one of two options if you find yourself making such comparisons: You can either choose to compare yourself to people who have less than you (which reminds you how truly rich and lucky you are), or you can feel gratitude for having people in your life who can inspire you.Either road can lead away from stress and envy, and closer to feelings of gratitude.Employers are often seen as the bad guys when in fact they are everyday heroes and optimists. If you are in a job right now, accept that until the time is right, a job is a very great privilege and say ‘Thank you’ to your bosses today. Developing an attitude of gratitude is one of the most important and essential things that you can do to attract and manifest the things that you desire into your life – in this case through your employer.  "
2 February 2020,‘Lankans need to patronise local products and services’,"The Sunday Observer Business Chat column features leading business personnel who express their views on their business.Today, we feature Shiran Fernando CEO/ Director of the Tess Group of Companies, the largest canned fish producer and exporter in Sri Lanka. He is also the President of the Canned Fish Manufacturers’ Association and works hard to provide economic benefits to society, particularly the fishing community while positively contributing to the national development agenda of the Government.He promotes local products and is of the view that all Sri Lankans need to encourage local industries in terms of patronising products and services and recognising their contribution for a better Sri Lanka.The fisheries sector is one of the industries which can help develop the country and people quickly and yet sustain its position. As Sri Lanka owns a sea area 10 times the size of its land area, the resources available are vast.The fishing industry could bring rapid development to the country by generating foreign exchange through exporting and providing much needed nutrition to the population and keeping the nation healthy by averting the high rate of anemia prevalent among them today. It is important to note that one in every three people is suffering from anemia and this is common among many children. Fish could be an ideal source to obtain the required nutrition.Sri Lanka is surrounded by the sea. We need to have a well focused strategy to gain maximum advantage of this resource which could be our key economic driver in time to come if necessary and proper planning is in place.As a country we import US $ 64 million worth of canned fish and this action needs careful evaluation and re-thinking. We could save valuable foreign exchange and generate employment if the required governmental support is given. It is a matter of prioritising our national agenda to protect and nurture local industries which could contribute greatly to the economy.There are over 600,000 fishermen and a 1.5 million strong fishing community in the country. Their living standards could be uplifted by providing the necessary environment to continue their livelihood.The Government needs to seriously look at facilities given to the canned fish importers which are detrimental to the local producers. For example, the Government reduced the import duty on canned fish from Rs. 102 to Rs. 52 and this was a big blow to the local canned fish manufacturers who were well set to meet the local needs.There are four canned fish manufacturing factories and one factory has closed down due to intense competition from cheap imports mainly from China. This is an opportune time for the Government to consider curtailing imports from China as incidents such as the Corona virus too will have an impact on these types of imports. Most of these products are of inferior quality and Sri Lanka has become an easy dumping ground for these imports. The nutrition level of this product is also questionable as they have a long shelf life. On the contrary, the local products are canned within a day and they are more fresh and nutritious. The Canned Fish Manufactures Association, the voice of the local industry urges the Government to re-introduce the same import tax structure to enable the industry to make a come back and be a key economic driver of the country.“We have the capacity to meet the entire local requirement provided we are given the Government backing. On average 150,000 cans of fish are consumed daily. We value the measures taken to purchase local canned fish for government institutions and this practice needs to be continued. The local canned fish industry uses 100 per cent locally sourced products, from fish to can and label and it’s economic value is more,” he said.The Government needs to intervene in a situation where the local catch is not sufficient to meet the demand and it needs to take action to import the required quantity till the shortage is over. This will be a short time practice and the authorities should have proper control over this as otherwise it will negatively impact the fishery industry.On the nutrition side, the UN says that nutrition level in people is low. The way to increase nutrition is through protein consumption. Fish is an ideal form of protein. Therefore, if necessary measures are taken to encourage fishermen to increase the catch and the excess to be given to the three canned factories, the country will have a reasonably priced source of protein. This will help address a social issue as well as create more economic activities that will have far reaching benefits to society.The government must focus attention on this industry. This will not only save foreign exchange and provide much needed nutrition to the people, but will generate employment while uplifting the living standards of the fishing community which is a neglected social segment at present.The Tess Group of Companies which has four subsidiaries, Tess (Pvt) Ltd, Tess Agro, Tropic Fishery and Tropic Frozen Foods Ltd has ventured in to diverse activities. The Tess company is the first EU registered factory in Sri Lanka. It also operates a cold chain and has the only long line vessel fleet in the country.“We actively contribute to the national economy. We expect the Government to support us to sustain our efforts and to continue our ethical business,” he said."
12 June 2021,Succeeding in the social age: promises and perils amid a pandemic,"Social media has increasingly become a part of our daily lives, with respect to its attractiveness. It can have a developmental or detrimental approach towards something or someone. We have often seen how it can jumble fact with fiction in creating chaos. Today’s column is a discussion on the role of social media amidst a planetary pandemic with its associated promises and perils.Overview“Social media has taken the world by storm, leaving many people in the dust. At long last, we have a survival guide. This lively, timely book is relevant for all of us”, said Adam Grant, Professor at Wharton Business School,  in commenting on the book. Social media is commonly known as social network web sites (SNWs) such as Facebook, MySpace, and the more professionally oriented LinkedIn.  I came across an interesting and insightful book, titled,” a World Gone Social”. The authors Ted Coine and Mark Babbit take us through an important journey in discussing how we have transitioned from the industrial age to what they coin, “the social age.” SNWs and related applications (e.g., micro-blogging web sites such as Twitter) also allow recruiters to conduct extensive background checks.  SNWs allow individual users to post personal information on the internet in order to communicate with friends. Twitter allows short weblog (‘‘blog’’) messages of 280 characters (called ‘‘tweets’’) and full social network web sites such as Facebook, Google Buzz, and MySpace allow users to post multiple pages and include photos and videos; friends can also make comments.Both authors are social media experts. Ted Coine is the co-founder of Switch and Shift, an online community focused on leadership, culture, and change in the Social Age. Recently named a Forbes “Top 10 Social Media Power Influencer,” he lives in Naples, Florida. Mark Babbit is CEO and Founder of YouTern, a social resource for young professionals that Mashable (a digital media network) calls a “Top 5 Online Community for Starting Your Career.” He lives in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.Insurmountable“The Industrial Age is dead; welcome to the Social Age”. That’s how the authors start the journey. According to them, “social media has proven to be an insurmountable market force, changing how we innovate, collaborate, serve our customers, hire and develop team members, motivate others toward a common mission, communicate with stakeholders, display our character, and demonstrate accountability.”This isn’t change for the sake of change. Neither is this change to fine-tune the status quo, as we saw in the twentieth century with Six Sigma, Total Quality Management, and the Lean movement, which simply helped bureaucracies function at a more efficient, profitable level. “This is real, systemic change”, observed Ted and Mark.The book begins with a discussion on the surface changes currently underway — business issues that have caught much attention. The authors discuss how some old-school leaders seem dimly aware of the new era upon us and so are left grasping in the dark, while others remain unconvinced of the power of social media, so they fail to take action. “We’ll also take on those who resist for another reason: the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” crowd, oblivious to the imminent change — and the turf protectors who perhaps have a vested personal interest in resisting social media’s influence,” state the authors. “Just like the meteor that likely precipitated the end of the dinosaurs, social media is having a monumental impact on the world economy; a change so dramatic that it has created a new business era. “Welcome to the Social Age”, is the invitation from the book. Dinosaurs“Although we can brag about our “presence” on social media, there’s a deep and swift undercurrent of discontent”, observe Ted and Mark. Especially among enterprise leaders, the sentiment seems to be: “Social is all hype” and “Social isn’t working for us.” According to them, the resistance seems to come from several different camps:* Those rooted in the belief that social media is a fad and will go the way of the Rolodex, fax machine, and VHS.* Those living in a comfortable state of ignorance: “If I don’t know it, it can’t be that big a deal.”* Those who view social media from a “sales have never been better; our quarterly report was great; why change now?” mentality.* Those who are afraid to lose the control they have now as leaders (and our experience shows there are more old-schoolers in this camp than we would like to admit). They don’t want change, because it effectively means the end of their power.The authors comment on this resistance and relate it to the arrogance of some leaders who are reluctant to change. They highlight a true incident that took place in in October 1998 off the coast of Kerry, Ireland:Irish: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the south, to avoid a collision.British: Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to the north to avoid a collision.Irish: Negative. Divert your course 15 degrees to the south to avoid a collision. British: This is the captain of a British navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course. Irish: Negative. I say again, you will have to divert YOUR course.British: This is the aircraft carrier HMS Britannia! We are the second largest ship in the British Atlantic fleet. We are accompanied by three destroyers, three cruisers, and numerous support vessels. I demand that you change your course 15 degrees north. I say again, that is 15 degrees north, or countermeasures will be undertaken to ensure the safety of this ship and her crew.Irish: We are a lighthouse. Your call.Obviously, arrogance prevented reaching out and knowing the truth. The way I see it is that the time has come to shift the “dinosaur mindset” to a “dynamic mindset” with more willingness to embrace change.  Leaders Generation Y, or the Millennials are considered as “digital  natives”. When they make up the majority of the workforce, the workforce thinks much differently. In today’s workforce, many of us trust each other and communicate more, and in turn, we’re more authentic and open to input and criticism. Many of us invite collaboration from all sources — even from our competition, when mutually beneficial. More than anything else, we’re more cooperative, and more social.  “As organisations and leaders, we must adapt to this social, collaborative, open environment — or we simply won’t survive” observe the authors. For many organisations still entrenched in old- fashioned Industrial Age – style management practices, it may be too late. Ted and Mark present evidence to prove that  enabled by social, the human side of business grows exponentially. Here are the salient points highlighted by them: In the form of freelancers, competition in our new economy sprouts up at will. With little or no infrastructure, minuscule start-up costs, and next-to-nothing monthly expenses, they launch in a matter of days— and gain immense traction, even when competing against corporate giants— through social media. Customers, no longer beholden to marketing departments or advertising agencies for guidance or input, confer with each other; they compare notes, thoughts, and experiences about the companies with which they and their vast networks do business. One person, with a Twitter account and a lot of passion, can hobble corporate titans, media outlets, politicians, and others with less-than-honourable ambitions. Expertise has become democratic; in less than an hour and for zero dollars, anyone can establish him- or herself as an expert — or an expert critic— in any industry. Without corporate consent (or even knowledge), employees collaborate with each other, as well as with vendors, with customers, and even with competitors.Job seekers ask current employees (as well as past employees, vendors, customers, partners, public forums, and personal networking contacts) what working at the company is really like; in the process, they mute the canned, inauthentic messages of recruiters and public relations departments.Highly competitive human resources departments — those effectively attracting, hiring, and retaining top talent in our new economy— are becoming human again (the rest are accelerating their companies’ collective plunge toward extinction).Through digital self- learning, knowledge is everywhere.The “powers that be” — those previously able to hoard knowledge— are now impotent rulers, the “powers that were.”In such a backdrop, let us see the relevance of SNWs to a world ravaged by a continuing contagion. A recent publication of the World Health Organization (WHO), titled,  “Social media & COVID-19: A global study of digital crisis interaction among Gen Z and Millennials” sheds much light in this regard. Glimpses of a global study Although young people are less at risk of severe disease from COVID-19, they are a key group in the context of this pandemic and share in the collective responsibility to help us stop transmission. They are also the most active online, interacting with an average number of 5 digital platforms (such as, Twitter, TikTok, WeChat and Instagram) daily.According to the WHO report, to better understand how young adults engage with technology during this global communication crisis, an international study was conducted, covering approximately 23,500 respondents, aged 18-40 years, in 24 countries across five continents. This project was a collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO), Wunderman Thompson, the University of Melbourne and Pollfish. With data collected from late October 2020 to early January 2021, the outcomes provide key insights on where Gen Z and Millennials seek COVID-19 information, who they trust as credible sources, their awareness, and actions around false news, and what their concerns are. As the report observed, when asked what Covid-19 information (if any) they would likely post on social media, 43.9% of respondents, male and female, reported they would likely share “scientific” content on their social media. This finding appears to buck the general trend on social media where funny, entertaining, and emotional content spread fastest. More than half (59.1%) of Gen Z and Millennials surveyed are “very aware” of “fake news” surrounding COVID-19 and can often spot it. However, the challenge is in recruiting them to actively counter it, rather than letting it slide, with many (35.1%) just ignoring it.According to the said survey findings, Centennials (Generation Z) and Millennials (Generation Y)  have multiple worries beyond getting sick. While it is often suggested that young adults are ‘too relaxed’ and do not care about the crisis, this notion is not reflected in the data, with over 90% of respondents were very concerned or somewhat concerned about the risk of infection. Beyond getting sick themselves, the top concern of respondents (55.5%) was the risk of friends and family members contracting Covid-19, closely followed by the economy crashing (53.8%).The report highlights the need to navigate their digital world safely and make choices to not only protect their health but also the health of their families and communities. These insights can help health organisations, governments, media, businesses, educational institutions, and others sharpen their health communication strategies. Ensuring policy and recommendations are relevant to young people in a climate of misinformation, skepticism, and fear.Way forward We have seen the media reports of the good, the bad and the ugly use of facebook in Sri Lanka. Some spend more time connected with facebook friends without even showing their face to the loved ones near and dear. With the presence of over 10 million Sri Lankan users of the internet, the increasing trend of using the SNWs for multiple purposes is obvious. The necessity to work from home has further intensified it. There may be policy issues and procedure inadequacies. Yet, the fact remains that the emerging workforce is more tech-savvy and internet-friendly. Rising popularity of the internet usage for socially critical events such as releasing of exam results, utility payment gateways is a promising sign. Much could be done with both creativity and control in order to ensure reaping the richness of social age."
17 May 2020, Back to business,"Green shoots begin to sprout in some way for small scale businesses in Colombo after a lull of nearly two months, providing a sigh of relief to many who manage to eke out a living from a little venture set up on the pavements. Here goods being delivered to shops down a street in Pettah."
6 December 2020,Challenge people to discover their best,"The general notion of motivating people is a pat on the back but does that only raise the level of performance we need amidst ever growing challenges. A pat on the back should only be when someone really does a good job and if not you as a leader would be doing injustice to the people.Given the erratic nature of the operating environment, which on a daily basis dictates and significantly changes the operating environment for business organisations, employers and employees are faced with the challenge of having to constantly adapt to meet challenges head-on, and to figure out new ways of working.The work environment for employees is fast-paced, dynamic and challenging, making your strategies and value propositions short lived so you need constant creativity, analytical thinking, continuous improvements and correct speed of execution to improve or sustain performance.To succeed as a manager you have to grow yourself and when you become a manager, success depends on how you grow your team members. Challenging employees to reach their best potential is one good way of growing them.Employees have the potential to do more than they think they can and it is not until they enter the working world that many slowly begin to discover that. An employee who recognises the value of a challenge, and experiences the personal and professional growth through overcoming the challenge, is an employee who will develop a positive and realistic self-worth, and an understanding that personal achievement and business achievement are inextricably linked.Leaders have widely divergent ideas about what really motivates the team mates, with some leaders ending up in avoidance mode. Most performance problems aren’t dealt with directly. More often, instead of taking action, the manager will transfer the person somewhere else or match the work to his capacity.Most leaders try to combine a mix of challenge and support to get the best out of their teams. Achieving this balance is never easy, and is specific to each person. But in the end, growing others is a worthwhile effort for both noble and self-interested reasons. It’s personally rewarding to help others accomplish more than they’d thought possible.Pay for performanceRaise the bar, create a sense of internal competition, differentiate and pay for performance and reward excellence. Performance differentiation is the best way to motivate the high performers.When an organisation creates such a performance culture, employees at the bottom end will have to either catch up to match up or give up the competition and look elsewhere. Managers should distinguish those who would like to stay in the game from people who are unwilling to compete and deal with the two categories appropriately.Challenging employees may also provide the benefit of increasing their level of job satisfaction. There are a number of ways to challenge an employee; whichever method you use, make sure the employees feel like the process is to help them and not to penalise anyone.Job rotation is a good way to build capacity in employees and it prevents the boredom and stagnation that can occur from repeatedly performing the same tasks. Job rotation challenges and stimulates workers by offering them the opportunity to learn new job functions and develop skills, which also makes them more valuable assets to the organisation.Workers who seek advancement opportunities may view job rotation as a way to become more attractive managerial candidates, as they will develop a broader perspective of how your organisation functions.Push people to innovateEncouraging innovation and creativity can lead to ideas that can help your business grow. Challenge your employees to become innovators by starting an idea generation program where employees are rewarded for ideas that are eventually adopted and implemented by your company. Rewards can take the form of monetary compensation or public recognition, or the opportunity for the creator to lead a team charged with bringing the idea to fruition.Increase employee engagement by involving them in the decision-making process.For instance, have a trusted employee sit in on a job interview to provide input about the candidate’s suitability for the position, and how he might fit in with the team. By increasing your employees’ engagement level, they will feel they have a greater stake in the direction of the company, which can challenge and motivate them.Leaders have tremendous power simply by being in a position of authority, and can use their words to influence how others view themselves. The act of expressing belief in your employees and focusing on setting high, but achievable standards for them has real repercussions.When we communicate with an employee, we too often leave out the potential we see in them to be successful. We may challenge them but not say why we’re sure they can do it. Instead, consider the idea that if you see something praiseworthy, innovative, or potential-enhancing from your team members, call it out.Yes it’s a Covid-19 ridden environment where motivating people is extremely hard – yes, but this is the time leaders need to keep people challenging and motivating people to find solutions to outer issues through inner capacity."

11 October 2020,Customer Acquisition Cost gives insight into profitability,"The Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is the average individual cost related to gaining a new customer to a business. This is a lead generation metric that refers to the resources and expenditure incurred to obtain a customer.Every business must concentrate on the acquisition cost and focus on reducing this cost to enhance the profits of an organisation. Successful marketing companies keep a close tab on the CAC and engage various methods and strategies to cut down this cost to the optimum levels.Measuring the cost to obtain a new customer is specifically important to small and medium business owners because the information provides an insight into the overall existence. The CAC helps business owners to understand the level of profitability by comparing the amount of money spent on each new customer.This vital information can be immensely useful to plan sales strategies. Winning companies make strategies to spend their resources efficiently to minimise the CAC. For example, if the company’s digital marketing campaigns are successful and bring adequate leads, the cost of hiring additional sales development cadre and their cold calling expenses, that is comparatively very high, can be reducedProper management of CAC helps to make more informed and accurate decisions, particularly pertaining to marketing costs. It is essentially vital to understand that the exercise should be done cautiously. The organisation must not spend more than the value of the customer is expected to provide over its life cycle. To control CAC, companies set goals and impose limitations on expenditure.Typically, the CAC is calculated by measuring the expenditure during a specific period and comparing that figure against subsequent periods. For example, if the company spends Rs. 100,000 as marketing and sales expenditure in three months and acquired fifty customers, the average CAC per customer is Rs. 2,000.Customer acquisition cost can be simply calculated by taking total sales and marketing costs and dividing it by the number of new customers acquired during a specific month, a quarter, or a year. This figure indicates the average cost per customer of the company. When calculating, marketing expenses such as promotions, advertising, publishing content creation, etc. are considered. Usually, expenditure on salaries, technical costs, transport costs, and any other related expenditure is also taken into consideration.It is imperative to understand the breakdown of expenditure in this exercise. Therefore, the categories to identify the related costs should be done carefully.Marketing costsThe marketing costs usually refer to the amount spent on marketing campaigns, print and electronic media advertising, digital media advertising, below the line advertising, and promotions. The salaries, incentives, traveling and accommodation expenses should be added to the calculation.The cost incurred for outsourced third-party services such as freelance graphic designers, content creators, or video production creators should also be added to the cost. Apart from the direct costs mentioned, it is good to include overhead expenditure such as consumables and any other cost that the company may spend.Every business entity should focus on minimising CAC to augment profits as much as possible. Optimising web presence is one of the key strategies a company can use to reduce acquisition costs. In this internet era, paying for print, electronic, and social media is not sufficient. Therefore, an effective and engaging website is an essential requirement in today’s context.Most often, when a potential customer comes across a message from any of the available media, they invariably try to go through the website of the advertiser to obtain more details. An easy to navigate website with clear content and responsive design can produce amazing results. Maintaining an efficient website is successful and cost-effective to secure new customers. The company must make sure that they are reaching the right and relevant audience if they want to get the best out of the funds spent.The team must understand the customer persona to target sales and marketing efforts.For example, the target audience is teens, the organisation needs to focus primarily on YouTube where it is known that such groups spend time on that channel. Similarly, if the target is predominantly young females, Facebook ads are most effective.For any audience and any product in Sri Lanka, Facebook can be a hugely successful channel as a staggering number of 6.4 million accounts is operational currently.Customer experienceHowever, by integrating advertising in Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram with the website, the advertiser can obtain warm traffic rather than cold leads.Acquisition strategies must be applied in varied angles and methods to gain more new customers. Using different channels and changing advertising frequencies should be done to avoid failures that may occur in a single channel method. Experimenting with varied efforts will ensure a continuous and healthy result. Using canvassing teams, email campaigns, social media efforts, and customer retention strategies by different teams in the company can be incorporated into one common endeavour.However, the mother of all strategies is to provide an excellent customer experience to every customer as in any sales effort.Happy and contented customers are the best method to lower customer acquisition costs. Research and experience confirm that customers trust their family, friends, and acquaintances’ opinion about a product than advice from a business or a salesman. It is also revealed that many customers do not fully trust the contents of sponsored social media advertisements.Concentrating on providing an exceptional customer experience not only lower the CAC but also increase the customer lifetime value. Therefore, the special attention of business owners is essential to meet individual customer’s needs.Dedicated executives should be available to look into the needs and manage any possible issues related to the product or the service.Customers will act as natural promoters of the business if the service delivery of the company is of a high standard.Another important factor companies should be aware of is the Customer Life Time Value (CLTV). While the two metrics are interrelated, they are different as well.CAC is the initial cost of acquiring a customer and CLTV is the amount of money a customer spends during the time he or she remains with the company and purchasing goods.Therefore, maintaining the retention of customers and creating a healthy lifetime value is incredibly useful to reduce CAC and increase revenue for the organisation. The bottom line is that satisfied customers will bring in new customers.Being on the guard on the customer acquisition cost of a business is a critically important factor. It not only gives the management a clear indication of the profitability bus also provides strong results on the profits. Reducing acquisition cost in turn minimises all other costs of the organisation in the long run.Merely by reducing CAC, the company can spend more funds on other key areas such as product development, re-investment, expansion, and diversification. "
8 August 2021,Australia to utilise business immigration for economic recovery,"Australian borders still remain closed despite the economic toll. However, Australia’s vaccination is gaining momentum raising hopes for better tomorrows for students waiting to study in Australia and others waiting to migrate.Australian Prime Minister on July 25 said the vaccine hit a record last Saturday, with more than 100,000 doses delivered, bringing the total number to 11.14 million. Thirty-eight percent of the population now has had at least one dose and over 16 percent with two.“In the past six days, we’ve been able to administer a million doses. So, we’re now able to deliver those a million doses even under a seven-day period, and that is really hitting the marks that we’d hoped to be hitting with that rate of vaccination now… The vaccination rates we’re achieving on a weekly and a daily basis are certainly the marks we’d hoped to be hitting by about this time of the year. And, that means we will continue to make up ground,” the Premier said.He added that 85 million doses for boosters for 2022 and 2023 have been secured in a new contract put together with Pfizer, in addition to the 40 million doses this year, combined with AstraZeneca vaccines, produced within Australia, and the 10 million Moderna vaccines that come on stream from September. There is 51 million of Novavax, which is also pre-ordered, as well.The Spokesperson for the Australian Department of Home Affairs, when contacted by the Sunday Observer said, as noted in the recent Australian Government Budget, released in May 2021, the weak outlook for population growth in the near term as a result of border closures is weighing heavily on the outlook for real GDP growth. “Migration has broad benefits for the Australian economy, adding to the supply and the demand of labour. Recent modelling of the economic benefits of migration in the 2021 Intergenerational Report supports this.”FlexibilityThe Spokesperson added that Australia’s 2021-22 Migration Program settings are designed to maximise flexibility for increased migration when conditions allow, recognising the timing for international travel restrictions easing remains unclear.“The Australian Government is in discussions with all states and territories about continued planning for international student arrivals when conditions allow. These discussions are led by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment. Any future decisions on the return of international students will be guided by expert health advice,” the Spokesperson said.The Australian Department of Home Affairs reiterated that Australia “looks forward to welcoming international students back to our classrooms, campuses and communities when conditions allow.To support international student arrivals, the Government has developed the Protocols and Preconditions for International Student Arrivals.”This protocol outlines the steps for states and territories and education institutions to prepare for international student arrivals at scale, using either hotel and/or industry-led models of quarantine. This document is subordinate to other border and health protocols, and is subject to change, including incorporating lessons learnt from pilots.“States and territories are responsible for using these protocols to develop plans for international student arrivals. Any plan must be approved by the relevant state or territory First Minister and Chief Health Officer, to ensure the health and safety of Australians and international students,” the Spokesperson said, adding “holding a visa does not allow a student to travel to Australia.Restrictions on travel to Australia remain in place for students not offered the opportunity to travel to Australia under a state or territory Student Arrival Plan or under an existing exemption category. Quarantine arrangements are a matter for local state and territory governments.” Detailed information on Australia’s border arrangements during the Covid-19 pandemic can be found at https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/.Speaking on the Business Migration opportunities, Specialist Immigration Lawyer from Melbourne, Don Susantha Katugampala said the Australian economy has done excellently compared to many other economies in the world. With the new financial year, certain priorities have been given to business migration. Visa structure or subclass has not changed on July 1 but the requirements for each visa subclass has changed.“For Business Owner Visa, the turnover of your business overseas has increased from AUS $ 500,000 to AUS $ 750,000 a year for two financial years.ApplicantThe asset requirements has increased from AUS $ 800,000 to AUS $ 1.25 million between the applicant and the applicant’s spouse. The asset ownership must be there for two years prior to the application. If you come on investor visa, the old system prior to July 1 was to invest AUS $ 1.5 million in Government bonds.This has increased to AUS $ 2.5 million into Government bonds in the state that you’ve been nominated. For the significant investor visa, the requirement has not changed but remains AUS $ 5 million. In the significant investor visa, the benefit is that in order to secure your permanent residency you need to spend the minimum time in Australia which is the advantage for the investor.The Government is giving some priority to the entrepreneur visa which was in the regulations but from July 1 the Government has taken special initiative to promote that entrepreneur visa where the entrepreneurs can secure their migrations.But the entrepreneur visa requires that the applicant propose the entrepreneurial activity which has to be an innovation and a beyond average business plan. If the applicant secures that then they would receive a successful business migration.”Katugampala added: “There’s a positive economic growth in Australia with the lowest unemployment rate compared to many other Western countries. Therefore, those from other parts of the world are looking to come to Australia to invest. The Government becomes selective in raising the bar for the business migration applicants. So it’s important to seek proper advice and then submit the application with proper documentation.”MigrationHe said that there is priority for business migration and the biggest quota for business migration is in New South Wales, the commercial hub of Australia.“As Fairfields Lawyers, we focus on migration, business, skilled, employer sponsored migrations, global talent migration. As lawyers, we assist in commercial and business law.Rather than going to a business broker, the commercial networks in Australia being built over the years matters to our clients. For that you need to secure good legal advice before investing to secure your investment,” Katugampala added.As vaccination gains momentum in many countries including Sri Lanka and Australia, partnerships are set to develop with more vigour in a post-Covid scenario."

28 February 2021,"Supplier respect for business and human rights, key for sourcing","Sri Lankan exporters could face a tough path ahead as Germany plans to introduce a new law where itsimporters will be under obligation to continuously verify that their suppliers respect United Nation Guiding Principles (UNGP) of business and human rights.Violations would be sanctioned with penalties up to 10% of the importer’s annual turnover and exclusion from public tenders up to three years. A joint inter-ministerial draft law is to be presented  mid next month to the German parliament.  The  Supply Chain Law  will make  Germanycompanies legally responsible for human rights and environmental issues throughout their global supply chains. The move was immediately welcomed by the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights which said the proposed new law was urgently needed in high-risk sectors such as textiles. During the panel discussion with company representatives of the targeted sectors of apparel, food and tourism, panellists stressed how much their businesses are related to consumer driven sustainability requirements and how important the documentation of UNGPs conform processes is. Country Head for Sri Lanka and Bangladesh of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, Hubertus von Welck  emphasised that companies should be open for standards under the UN Guiding Principles and incorporate those in their in-house procedures. In a video message German Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, HolgerSeubert pointed out the relevance of the subject with regards to the upcoming Supply Chain Law in Germany.The second hybrid conference on Sustainable Supply Chains facilitates market excess for Sri Lankan exporters to the EU-market. The Delegation of German Industry and Commerce (AHK Sri Lanka) and the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom (FNF) co-organised a second hybrid conference on “Sustainable Supply Chains as drivers of global competitiveness” on February 24.Since September 2020, the two organisations in cooperation with Loening Human Rights and Responsible Business have conducted several training  programs, individual gap assessments and covered the preconditions for certifications for Sri Lankan exporters in the sectors of rubber, apparel, and food products. All project partners agreed to extend the project to the Sri Lankan tourism sector.Chief Delegate of German Industry and Commerce and Industry in Sri Lanka Andreas Hergenroether said, “The major reason to partner for the initiative is to support Sri Lankan exporters to obtain broader market access and to enable German and European importers to import according to international sustainability standards. Sustainability standards are a reality.They are partially politically driven, but they are also more consumer and industry driven. Besides the existing official legally binding standards, European importers require more and more consumer and industry driven standards such as Fairtrade, BSCI, SA8000 and IFS,” he said.Country Head for Sri Lanka and Bangladesh of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom  Hubertus von Welck said that the initiative “Sustainable supply chains as driver for global competitiveness” has been taken up and is now been extended as a contribution to the restart of the Sri Lankan economy to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic as fast as possible.  AHK Sri Lanka is part of the German Chamber Network supported by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)."

17 May 2020,Pandemic’s impact on the retail industry,"As a result of the enduring experience of Covid-19 pandemic worldwide, the retail industry is facing substantial shifts and the amount of retail sales has already dropped to a new low.In particular, the consumer durable market will have a long term impact throughout the world according to expert opinion. Similarly, although consumer non-durables such as food and other essential consumables currently demonstrate a considerable surge, sustainability is questionable as a loss of income of the public at large. Therefore, retail sales of all three segments, consumer durables such as home appliances, furniture, motor vehicles, electric. and electronics non durables such as food, textiles, footwear, cosmetics,  and services such as service stations, beauty parlours and landscaping will certainly undergo further ramifications.  All these factors mean that retailers are expected to be in an uphill climb for an indefinite period which will last from months to years. With continuously falling street sales and increasing online competition, retailers have to struggle and the existing negative impact has already lessened the chances of survival. The ultimate upshot depends on how efficiently the business segment responds to the situation during the initial post Covid 19 stage.Rising online operations will further hamper ‘brick-and-mortar’ sales up to a sizeable level after almost two months of lockdown, where a considerable number of consumers practiced online home deliveries.     Almost all the planning done for retail selling in the year had to be completely reshaped by the emergence of the deadly virus. Colossal efforts by the state machinery to contain the spread in the midst of costly quarantine process, poor economic performance during the past few years, various relief packages offered to the public along with near freeze of global shipping and travel has placed the Government barely above water.Odds of compensating or assisting existing retails business therefore has become non-priority as the Government is compelled to focus on more pressing issues.  The ‘Just in time’ concept where companies principally maintained their stocks at minimal level and replacing the stock perhaps will no longer be valid, at least for a considerable period into the future. In order to apply this method, manufacturers need to move products quickly and efficiently across countries when it comes to imports.Therefore, at least for the time being, Sri Lankan retailers will have to either stock more of the imported products or switch to local substitutes, which is the more beneficial option for the country’s economy. Along with the bans and restrictions on many non-essentials and the drive to promote the native industry, trade and services, the Government will certainly welcome the retailers swap to as many as local products.   Sri Lankan retailers of durables and nondurables have a little space to rely on imported products anymore. Many Sri Lankan entrepreneurs have already stepped out to initiate manufacturing to substitute the majority of imported consumer durables. They certainly may have to import raw material and accessories from overseas.Nevertheless, with clearly visible intention of President Rajapaksa to promote native industry and trade, retailing companies will be compelled to increase localisation.  Sri Lankan retail brands, searching for lessons out of the pandemic, will seriously consider integrating local supply chains.  The significant difficulty however, will be educating consumers on why the new local products are equal to or better than what was imported. The behaviour of Sri Lankans over consumer durables and even some non-durables such as food related products heavily leans on imported products. Consumers are currently predominantly accustomed to purchase products imported from either China or India.Over the years, they did not have a choice due to the unavailability of local products to purchase as most of these consumer durables were imported. Even if such local products were available, the general opinion was that they are inferior. Hence, an additional effort has to be made to change this mindset in order to switch the Sri Lankans to locally made products.   Gradual domination of online shopping which actually managed to beat general retail stores is a concern, although majority of Sri Lankans still prefer to visit and select durables as yet. However, during the lockdown period many mobile phone users started ordering online consumer goods, food related items in particular. Sri Lanka has a staggering 30 million mobile connections, more than the total population, of which 5.2 million were mobile broadband connections in 2018 as per the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. The number must be much higher by now.  Many of these users can be persuaded to order products online if the relevant operators decide to do so. This can hamper retail store business for both durables and non durables. On the other hand, by entering into e-commerce, the retailers too can balance the growth of their business operations. Almost all large scale retailers are already engaged in online trading successfully.Research reveals that while categories such as electronics, home appliances, books are being ordered online more often than products such as food, beverages and cosmetics are lagging behind. A prolonged period of social distancing and other health restrictions will likely convince people to use the web to order even essential food products. In fact, there is a marked ballooning in retail online sales shown in demand for groceries during the curfew period.  D2C, DTC or Direct-To-Consumer brands had been in the forefront bypassing the standard distribution methods hitting almost every retail sector, covering consumer durables and nondurables. DTC movement of selling everyday items which used to be sold in a physical store, a showroom or a third party wholesaler, has become the future of retailing. This method offers greater convenience, typically through a subscription that ships the order directly to your door, often at a lower price as well.  The global pandemic is giving a noteworthy boost to DTC as consumers may most likely shift their spending from in-person to online. Therefore, DTC brands will have a surge in business volumes immediately after the pandemic is over or controlled. Sri Lankans medium scale retailers will have to grasp the fact almost immediately and plan to offer online service, while running their physical stores.   Coronavirus pandemic has already smashed up the world in many unprecedented ways and will remain for an indefinite period, according to health experts. It will go down as one of the most damaging events the world experienced during the past few centuries.However, Sri Lankan retail needs to prepare for the consumer behavior shifts after Covid-19.They need to adapt, develop, adjust and come up with fresh plans to face the challenge. The country will breathe a sigh of relief as China has opened the country in full and appears to be recovering faster than expected. With ongoing controls, Sri Lanka too will be on her path to recovery sooner than expected."
10 January 2021,Creed of breeding leaders: Reflections on “Mind Before Action”,"The resilience and revival needed in the context of Covid-19 pandemic require well-groomed leaders on all fronts. As Peter Drucker said, there aren’t good or bad institutions but either well-managed or ill-managed ones.This is truly relevant to a nation as well. It sets an appropriate space to discuss the need to have “mind before action”. It is the acronym we promote to showcase the caliber of an MBA (Master of Business Administration”. Today’s column will pursue it further, in the context of inaugurating the largest MBA batch ever at PIM as its first ever virtual inauguration. Overview There had been many conversations on the changing face of MBA, the sought-after qualification among managers. It has been hailed as a competency builder on one hand and hacked as a money spinner for mushrooming institutions.I read with interest the constructively critical insights by Dr. Rakesh Khurana on elite Harvard MBA. It reminded me of Henry Mintzberg, the veteran management thinker who was also critical about the typical MBAs on offer. “From Higher Aims to Higher Hands” is the title of the treatise of Dr. Rakesh Khurana. He shows that university-based business schools were founded to train a professional class of managers in the mold of doctors and lawyers but have effectively retreated from that goal, leaving a gaping moral hole at the center of business education and perhaps in management itself. He clearly calls for reforms in management education. His criticism of Harvard MBA as a “uni-polar” MBA as opposed to being a “multi-polar” MBA is worth reflecting. According to Khurana, a “uni-polar” MBA trains managers to have lucrative carriers in multinationals and large conglomerates. Instead a “multi-polar” MBA should prepare the candidates in becoming entrepreneurs, setting up SMEs in fostering innovation and partnerships in offering best-cost solutions. It gave me a sense of satisfaction, as the MBA we offer has the scenario of making one out of five of its recipient’s entrepreneurs. In fact, we want to make this ratio doubled through the initiatives of the Business Incubation Centre. Criticisms of MBAs The most recent comment on MBAs came from Elon Musk, the dynamic business tycoon of SpaceX and Tesla fame. “There might be too many MBAs running companies.” In his view, the “MBA-isation of America” limits the creation of innovative products and services. Of course, there were many previous criticisms on MBA as well. “Management is a practice. And you learn management by practicing management. Experience is critically important. You don’t become a manager in a classroom and you certainly don’t become a leader in a classroom. Leadership is earned on the basis of people who choose to follow you. It’s not granted or anointed by some holy water granted in a school.” These are the very words of Henry Mintzberg, Professor of Management, at the Desautels Faculty of Management of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. As observed by Harry Costin, “Mintzberg provides a useful distinction between business and management. He argues that MBAs teach the fundamentals of business functions, not the practice of management. What is lost in the discussion is that M.B.A. literally means master of business administration, and therefore, even following Mintzberg’s argument, the degree does not disguise what it is really about. In essence, the term MBA itself is viewed as a misnomer. There is a wave of criticisms on MBAs around the world. Especially after the global credit crunch and the collapse of giants led by MBAs, this negativity has gathered momentum. I myself have heard from CEOs lamenting that some of their MBAs know a lot of theory but sadly lack the practical approach in applying them into real issues. Taking this issue into a broader perspective, an ongoing debate in the USA has even reach a point to say that MBA awarding business schools have an identity crisis. I am confident that we will not allow that to happen to us. Yet, it is better to be proactive than being reactive.According to Forbes Magazine, Business schools have always juggled two missions: educating practitioners and creating knowledge through research. Fifty years ago, as explained in the 2005 HBR article “How Business Schools Lost Their Way”, business schools shifted their focus from the former to the latter. Management became a science rather than a profession.This shift had profound implications. Business schools rewarded professors for publishing their research in academic journals, and their curriculum began to reflect the narrow focus of the faculty. Business school professors became increasingly disconnected from practicing managers and leaders. By the mid-2000s, it became clear that business schools had swung too far in one direction.Ironically, we have seen a large number of MBAs move up in their career ladder in occupying leadership positions. I see the issue is not with What MBA is but more of How MBA should be. I presume it is with this spirit, late Prof. Uditha Liyanage, former director of PIMA said, “Do not Do an MBA but Be an MBA”. We have gone one step beyond in requesting the MBA aspirants to “be brilliant as an MBA”. There was a time in Sri Lanka where managers, when facing interviews, were asked whether they have an MBA. Now the key decision makers are smart enough to ask instead from Where  they have got their MBA. Amid a proliferation of a multitude of MBAs, authentic products have a high demand. MBA as a transformation Chairman of the Peoples Bank, Sujeewa Rajapakse recalled his transformation through the PIM MBA. He shared how he gained confidence and competence in handling complex business matters thanks to the MBA experience.He highlighted the need to develop leadership and complemented that the PIM has become the breeding institute of high calibre leaders. He also challenged the aspiring MBAs to be thorough with analytical skills on one side and innovative ideas on the other side. With rapid technological advancements, the need to have blended learning with the use of ICT tools is on the rise.  Also, greater flexibility from the students and the high standards from the institutions need to be maintained with proper balancing. We have realised the need to ensure quality and relevance at all times. I recall it was Dr. Travis Perera, my teacher at PIM who shared his thoughts on the dual aspects of MBAs. They are, in a way, consumers of PIM, receiving the education from us. At the same time they are co-producers of knowledge and skills. Hence the term borrowed from the marketing echelons, Prosumer, aptly demonstrates their nature.  The PIM’s  MBA inauguration last week, prompted me to move down memory lane. I indeed went through that transformational experience. I started off as an engineer and then switched over to management, I realised that an MBA would train the learner with a holistic view of a situation. In brief the learner will be able to enhance the functional knowledge through a cylindrical view to broad business knowledge through a conical view. This “interconnectedness” transforms the learner to appreciate other functions with a broader perspective or holistic view of the business. A good MBA curriculum should consist of business realities, challenges, new ways of looking at issues and produce out of the box solutions. From my own experience at PIM in talking to the alumni of MBA holders their single biggest factor in what makes them stand out among fellow peers is the “self-confidence” they have gained in experimenting, creating, innovating new pathways and questioning the traditional way of doing things. As a result, MBA inculcates a mindset to tackle issues in an innovative and integrated manner. Simultaneously, being an MBA will enhance the market value of a person. As for the entrepreneurs, they will have professionals producing value for their organisations in a sustainable manner at the end of the day. The ultimate outcome is the birth of a powerful social network sharing calibre and leading to dynamic forces within organisations and of course pursuing higher benchmarks in professionalism. Speaking from my own experience, becoming an MBA is changing a person’s attitude to fundamentally challenge and stretch one self. In other words, enhancing one’s capacity to cope with many fronts and priorities and thus maintain work-life balance. This aspect reiterates or complements the aspect of enhanced self-confidence in an MBA holder. Finally, the time dimension is as important and must cater for strategic and operational aspects of the business for sustainability in the long term. Equally as the educational thresholds are ever going up, the Accreditation system and Quality assurance are of paramount importance in offering a standard MBA.  I tend to think that the success of an MBA program reflects essentially on its Alumni. It gives me pride in stating that PIM being the pioneering MBA offering institution in Sri Lanka, has so far produced over 350 CEOs during the period of 35 years of its existence. It highlights the value of MBA with its quality and relevance, locally and globally. Way forwardAs the revered religious text The Dhammapada begins, “Mano Pubbangama Dhamma, Mano Setta Manomaya” (Mind is the forerunner for all success). That’s why we proudly associate our MBA as Mind Before Action. It is an invitation to transform from a task executor to a thinking executive. It is also a challenge to shift from a mere practitioner to a mega professional. With a right blend of knowledge-set, skills – set and values-set, the way forward can be indeed promising and productive. "
28 March 2021,Opposition can stoop to any level -Ajith Nivard Cabraal,"State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms Ajith Nivard Cabraal said the same set of people who were against the battle against terrorism, reconciliation, redevelopment of the North and the East are acting once again to discredit the Government and bring down our country.He appealed to the people not to be misled by this disinformation and false propaganda campaign carried out by the Opposition in order to gain their narrow political objectives. The State Minister in an interview with the Sunday Observer said the present Opposition will stoop to any level to create this disinformation against the Government.We are aware that some powerful elements are providing financial and consultancy support to this campaign. This is an organised crime where some big people have got involved and so this kind of effort needs to be brought to light.ExcerptsQ: Could you explain the outcome of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s recent visit to Bangladesh where you were also a part of the delegation?A: I think it had several key achievements. The most important one is he built a very sound rapport with the Bangladeshi Government and the Prime Minister which is very helpful and useful. One of the main effects of that was the immediate support to Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). In addition, we found that there were many instances of Sri Lankan investments in Bangladesh. Actually, when you do a complete assessment there is about a billion dollars of Sri Lankan investments in Bangladesh in the apparel, power, energy and banking sectors. So, that is a huge investment in Bangladesh. At the same time, we discussed South-South cooperation where Sri Lanka and Bangladesh can exchange investments within their reserve banks as well. That is another useful cooperation that we can talk about for the future.We also discussed the possibility of additional flights and having Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) including the exchange of students and intellectuals between two countries. We also laid emphasis on the possibility that soft skills are imparted particularly in the field of tourism where we can assist them and we can also help them with other instances such as human resource management.There was a wide range of ways in which we could cooperate. Sometimes, we think we can only cooperate with the countries in the West. I think that it is not the case and there are lots of instances and possibilities where we can definitely cooperate very closely with the countries in our region. I think that particular truth was very clearly established in the Prime Minister’s visit to Bangladesh and it was a very important and useful visit.Q: The Opposition attempts to portray the ‘Sugar Scam’ is bigger than the Treasury Bond Scam. Your comments?A: Even in my speech in Parliament, I gave a complete explanation about the Opposition’s disinformation campaign. There was nothing that they could do to counter that as they had no facts and figures to deal with their accusation. Those were exactly like the Lamborghini Cars or the Golden Horses that they spoke about in 2014. So, there was no ‘Sugar Scam’ whatsoever. We reduced the duty on dhal from Rs.10 to 25 cents, canned fish from Rs.100 to 25 cents, sugar from Rs.50 to 25 cents and big onions from Rs.50 to 50 cents respectively. So, what is wrong with that? We are giving the entire benefits to the people. The previous Government was only interested in increasing the Government revenue.They kept on saying that they increased the Government’s revenue but they taxed the people left, right and centre. They introduced a mansion tax, super gain tax and also imposed 15 per cent VAT through the NBT. We reduced all those taxes because we wanted to give the benefits to the people. That is the strategy of this Government.In the Covid-19 situation, we wanted the people to have relief in their cost of living as well. Naturally, the Government had to incur a loss of its revenue when you reduce taxes.The Opposition was trying to say the relief didn’t pass down to the people. I challenged them directly to prove that there was no benefit to the people as a result of the reduction of the taxes on some essential commodities. I told the Opposition to please tell us whether they want to re-impose the taxes. Naturally, they were silent. That shows the fallacy of their argument and the logic. I think now they will be thinking twice or thrice before making any such baseless allegations.Q: Rating agencies, Opposition politicians and other stakeholders had warned that Sri Lanka needs to come up with a sustainable debt repayment strategy given its commitments over the next five years and also focus on the quality of reserves. Would you like to comment on this?A: We also know that we have to pay our debts. We are improving our non-debt inflows and a method by which money can flow into the country by way of remittances. We are improving the exports. Amidst the Covid-19 outbreak, our exports in February were the highest ever in the past five years. We are slowly opening the country back so that tourism can flourish.We are making sure that any monies that need to come into Sri Lanka are given the right path without any hindrance as long as it is clean and comes through the normal banking channels. We are improving the services and exports such as trade, port services, insurance, consultancy and accountancy as well. We are also concentrating on Foreign Direct Inflows (FDIs).We are bringing a new law to the Port City. It has already been passed by the Cabinet and it will come into Parliament at its next session. We are starting a new pharmaceutical zone to manufacture and export pharmaceuticals. The Hambantota Industrial Zone is now in full swing and they have already got several new investors to come into Sri Lanka particularly in the field of the rubber industry. We are encouraging the assembling of vehicles as well and the new projects consist a vast number of subjects. These are all designed to bring new foreign exchange earnings to the country. We don’t want to get more loans and suffer like the former Yahapalana Government. We have a strategy which is completely different to them. They had a strategy where you go to the IMF or some other international monetary organization and obtain loans at any cost. We are not doing that and we are making sure that Sri Lanka can pay off all the debts and we are continuing to do that. If you remember this same Opposition said that we won’t be able to pay our debts in 2020 but we paid. Then they started saying if we paid our debts in 2020, we will not be able to pay our debts in 2021 but now we are paying.We are making sure that no one is defaulted by even a single dollar.Now the Opposition is saying that we will have problems in the next year or thereafter and this is complete misinformation. This is to put pressure on the Government by saying that the country can’t go on as there is no money. This is absolutely untrue.The so called ‘economic osthars’ of the former Yahapalana Government failed miserably in the last term as the then growth rate of 7.4 percent was reduced to mere two per cent during their tenure in office without having a Covid-19 pandemic or any other difficulties or global issues. Now they can’t tolerate that Sri Lanka is shining once again and that is their problem.Q: You recently had a meeting with several top investors in the Colombo Stock Exchange. Could you explain?A: We discussed the future plans and what Sri Lanka is going to do. They were interested to know our plans for the Stock Exchange. We told to them that we want to increase the number of listings. Even at this peak, we show the first share issued almost after five years coming to the market on March 23.One day it was presubscribed and Rs.4 billion issued which was unheard during the five years of those ‘economic osthars’. The stock market which was at 5000 APIs is now at 7000 APIs. Of course, it went up and had come down as well. Now it is at a very reasonable rate and it is moving up and down. However, we see some very clear trends and there is stability in the market. During these few days there has been a little bit of exchange rate pressure but it will stabilise very soon.Then we will have a stable exchange rate. We have the lowest ever interest rate in our country. The Stock Market is performing reasonably well. For the first time after several years, we had more foreign investor purchases. We have noticed that so many investors are showing signs of coming back into the country. So, the Opposition finds it very difficult to survive because none of these things happened during their time. I don’t think even the journalists could report anything and there was nothing to report other than the few lies they uttered.Q: How do you view the false propaganda campaign carried out by the Opposition against the Government?A: This Opposition has shown that they can stoop to any level. They can utter any lie and fabricate stories. They will even get children to come on to shows and say certain things for their advantage or even teach them to lie.They will bring pictures from outside Sri Lanka and show it as in Sri Lanka. They will cook up various pictures and put different faces to show something different. So, they will stoop to any level to create this disinformation against the Government. We know some powerful elements are providing financial and consultancy support to this. This is an organised crime where some big people have got involved in it. I think this kind of effort needs to be brought to light. Some countries after the 2015 defeat of then President Mahinda Rajapaksa openly said they helped the regime change.They were part of the whole exercise to change the Government. In their own estimates, they showered some huge sums such as US$ 300 to 400 million on those campaigns. Where did this money come from? It came from outside. So, they made a big effort to discredit that Government. The same set of people who were against the battle against terrorism, reconciliation, redevelopment of the North and the East are acting once again to discredit the Government and bring down our country. In Parliament on Tuesday (March 23), I made a special appeal to the people not to be misled by this type of misinformation carried out by the Opposition.Q: Some say while former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and several others were remanded in connection with the Treasury Bond Scam, the masterminds behind it are still roaming freely and the Government has failed to bring them to book. Your comments?A: I had consistently maintained that the masterminds must also be brought to book. In fact, I wrote a book titled “Great Bond Scam Cover Up” about the masterminds and the entire bond scam. I wrote that book because I wanted the people to know how this Bond Scam was covered up for so long. I think still the investigations have not been completed. If they go through the reports of the CID and various other Commissions, some leads were not pursued strongly enough and I would like those to be pursued.If we pursue those, I think the masterminds will come to light. I am keen that the masterminds of the Bond Scam be brought to light and hope these investigations would be reopened in certain areas to ensure that the real people who had been involved in this scam are brought to book as well.Q: At present deforestation and environmental issues are taken up by the Opposition as their main propaganda campaign against the Government. How does the Government respond to this disinformation campaign launched by the Opposition to discredit the Government?A: I think they know that the environment is something that is near and dear to everyone in our country as we love our nature, animals and greenery. We are all of the same mould. However, one must look at those who protected the environment and who made sure that all the canals in the country were cleaned up. Was it the UNP Government? Who made sure that the rivers were cleaned up? Actually, we did that. We ensured that the plastic items are reduced to a minimum. In fact, we are continuing to do that.These are the examples of the way that we have protected nature. In order to look after the country’s wildlife, we are putting up thousands of kilometres of electric fences to ensure that the elephants are safe. We are doing that because we want to see both the people as well as the elephants are safe. So, we have that kind of an attitude and we are continuing to do that.At the same time, what these Opposition politicians do is they take one incident out of proportion and make a story regarding that. Some television channels are experts for this and active in their own way to promote this kind of misinformation and they continue to do that.I think it is a very shameful act as so many people are involved in this treacherous propaganda. I hope they will realise their folly of those actions and hopefully not continue with this kind of tirade in the future as well. "
12 January 2020,Future trends in Annual Reports: ‘Regulators must create an enabling environment’,"Digital transformation will be the game changer for innovative organisations. Shareholders and other stakeholders are shifting focus towards business status quo than ever before. Smart companies see Annual Reports as a focal communication tool that enhances the communication experience as it serves the tangential interest to shareholders and other readers.Addressing a forum on ‘What is Next in Annual Reporting’ organised by Acclivity, Managing Director of Moore Stephens Consulting (Pvt) Ltd., Chairman of Sanasa General Insurance. Co. Ltd. and Chairman of the ITAG Committee in South Asia Federation of Accountants (SAFA), Tishan Subasinghe, presented international and local trends on how companies are moving away from traditional Annual Reporting to producing more homogeneous reports with many elements often blended into a similar structure or pattern, across companies, countries and industries.He said homogeneity is what is produced standardised, repetitive and undifferentiated corporate reporting which sets a great foundation for comparability and predictability for e.g. Data Analytics. The downside of the picture is lessening originality in various reporting attributes. However, the key focus is to serve as a resilient approach to help capitalise on business platforms to create sustained growth, to depict robust results and surface sustainable value for shareholders.As businesses cross borders widening their horizons, another trend setter in Annual Reporting is the approach to ‘Talk Global and Work Local’. It showcases the need to appeal to a wider and a plethora of diverse audience than in the past.Looking at Responsibility (which includes Sustainability, CSR, and ESG Reports) as well as Fiscal Annual reports, globally there is empirical evidence indicating partiality towards Responsibility reporting.‘2018 Trends in Corporate Reports’ by Strategic Brand Communications reported ‘140 of the Fortune 200 produced formal annual or bi-annual responsibility reports’, a somewhat increase from 136 in 2016.Responsibility reporting supports the co-existence of organizations in communities in which they operate. It also benefits to appraise organisation reputation as responsible corporate citizens, which can have a decisive impact on bottom-line financial performance. As in Europe and the US, Sustainability reporting and, Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosures are gaining popularity amongst reporting practitioners who strive to serve the existing and potential investors with producing informative collateral for their decision-making.Subasinghe said, “We are seeing a trend of producing user-friendly, comparable reports on the most important sustainability topics and companies meaningfully quantify and report on impact, including the SDGs, exhibiting both the impact of the company on sustainability and the impact of sustainability on the performance and direction of the company.”As competition, innovation and technological disruption are perceived as key drivers for organisations to stay relevant in today’s business context, ‘Trust’ is the determinant of its very existence. Annual reports therefore can be an irreplaceable tool in burnishing a company’s public image.Today, organisations use more of Storytelling, Print to Digital form of presentation, Long Scrolling Websites, Snack Contents, Visual Immersion, Data Visualisation and Infographics and Algorithm based presentation to form a critical communication tool in an increasingly stake-holder driven world.Subasinghe explained how digitisation trends have and can benefit organisations to go beyond Integrated Annual Reporting to serve the tangential interest of stockholders and other readers.Illustrating 2018 Trends in Corporate Reports by Strategic Brand Communications, he said 51% of the Fortune 200 created only PDF versions of the reports and 49% created only Online versions. 48% of reports included video and 22% created a digital component beyond PDF. Despite the inclination within the international arena, ‘Green Annual Report concept’, Sri Lanka is yet to embrace the concept comprehensively.The focus on ‘Digital Presentation’ with attractive elements, such as videos and use of HTML format as a high searchable and linking tool has come into existence in many developed markets.As well, the use of extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) for reporting requirement that has been regulated in over 70 countries via more than 100 different regulators either by means of mandation or on a voluntary basis by 2017, an avenue Sri Lanka is yet to comprehend.The session concluded with a panel discussion moderated by Chartered Accountant and Independent Consultant, Harsha Gunasena with panellists Chief Executive Officer, Colombo Stock Exchange, Rajeeva Bandaranaike and Chief Financial Officer, Softlogic Life Insurance, Nuwan Withanage.In discussion, Bandaranaike said that Sri Lanka must meet global trends of annual reporting that sets a redirection to values and financial data that go beyond conventional reporting standards.Regulators must establish broader collaboration facilitating for listed companies to follow a One code of Corporate Governance, he said.The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) together with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka issued a code for Corporate Governance in 2013 and later in 2017 revised to include some trending best practices.Controversially, in 2016, SEC mandated listed companies to follow the previous version issued in 2013. Later both institutions joined forces to revamp the code, then made it ‘Not mandatory to follow’. Yes, there are some organisations going beyond the mandates and recommendations, thus the need for regulators to facilitate one uniform direction in this endeavour.Withanage said that Annual Reports should emphasise equally on their business model elaborating input, value creation process and output and, reporting on the achievements of the previous year with a forward-looking mindset. This information is worth a king’s ransom for investors because naturally businesses face short term ups and downs.Increased focus on climate change related disclosures has already begun to influence companies to transform traditional annual reporting. More meaningful collateral is now being produced to communicate and measure the company’s and investor’s contributions and impact. The key is futuristic and focused on Creating Shared Value.The application of emerging technologies can help businesses to illustrate more meaningful disclosures which could create an impact on the Triple Bottom Line. Technologies, such as AI and Digital Reporting are gaining increasing popularity around the world and with the realisation of its potential, soon, locally as well.Sri Lanka must address the need for automated investment analysis to facilitate effective investor relations. Regulators should set the platform to facilitate adaptation of mixed communication channels through digitisation and XBRL reporting.Meanwhile, companies must realise the length and size of annual reports aren’t the game changer. It will be all about relevant information reaching the identified stakeholders in a timely manner.Reporting Online could add value but not meet the needs of all, thus it is vital to optimise the channels to report based on the business case. Regulators must consider collaborations to produce uniformity and one direction for companies since there are different guidelines issued by different regulators resulting in repetition and confusion sometimes.The system also must consider adopting greater consensus in Annual Reporting to help keep up with global trends and most of all stakeholder expectations for a fair review of the company standing. "
6 September 2020,Price wars in Covid 19 era,"Since business re-commenced operations after Covid-19 outbreak,  we have experienced price wars across a few industries like never before in Sri Lanka; the hotel industry, supermarkets and credit card business are a few glaring examples today.Business organisations use a wide range of tactics to ward off competitors to increase shattered revenue due to Covid-19. Increasingly, price is the weapon of choice to achieve short term goals. Price wars can create economically devastating and psychologically debilitating situations that take an extraordinary toll on an individual, a business, and industry profitability.No matter who wins, the combatants all seem to end up worse off than before they joined the battle. Yet, price wars are becoming increasingly common and uncommonly fierce in the Sri Lankan market following global trends.Most managers will be involved in a price war at some point in their careers regardless of which industry they are in. Professionals too face the same challenge in pricing given the multiple choices their clients have. Every price cut is potentially the first salvo, and some discounts routinely lead to retaliatory price cuts that then escalate into a full-blown price war.That’s why it’s a good idea to consider other options before starting a price war or responding to an aggressive price move with a retaliatory move. CommonGenerally, price wars start because somebody somewhere thinks prices in a certain market are too high. Or someone is willing to buy market share at the expense of current margins. Price wars are becoming more common because managers view a price change as an easy, quick, and reversible action.When businesses don’t trust or know one another very well, the pricing battles can escalate very quickly. And whether they play out in the physical or the virtual world, price wars have a similar set of antecedents.By understanding their causes and characteristics, managers can make sensible decisions about when and how to fight a price war, when to flee one - and even when to start one. It’s important for managers to understand why a price war is occurring - or may occur.But it’s also critical to recognise where to look for resources in battle. It’s important to carefully analyse your customers, company, competitors, and other players within and outside the industry that may have an interest in how the price war plays out.Good diagnoses involve analysing four key areas. They are ‘customer issues’ such as price sensitivity and customer segments that may emerge if prices change; ‘company issues’ such as a business’ cost structures, abilities, and strategic positioning; ‘competitor issues’, such as a rival’s cost structures, abilities, and strategic positioning; and ‘contributor issues’, or the other players in the industry whose self-interest or profiles may affect the outcome of a price war.An analysis of competitors - their cost structures, abilities, and strategic positioning - is equally valuable. Industrywide price reductions may be appropriate under certain circumstances. Pressure for short term resultsBut many unprofitable price wars take place because a company sees an opportunity to increase market share or profits through lower prices, while ignoring the fact that competitors will respond.Market research may reveal that increases in sales following a price cut justify the action, but this same research often simply ignores competitors’ price responses. Businesses need to pay attention at the strategic level to the twin questions of who will respond and how. Smart managers project how competitors will set prices by carefully tracking historical patterns, understanding which events have triggered price changes in the past, and by tracking the timing and magnitude of price responses.They monitor public statements made by senior executives and published in company reports. And they keep their eyes peeled for activity in markets: competitors who acquire a new technology, staff, information system, or distribution channel, or which form a new brand alliance, will probably make some kind of a price move that will affect other players in the industry. This sophisticated environmental scanning identifies possible adversaries and their likely implications. In free markets, competition is the norm, not the exception, and that competition will limit your latitude for pricing.  When competitors lower prices or new competition enters at a lower price, many a novice manager’s gut reaction is to lower prices — but the cost of price concessions may be higher than the cost of customer losses.Experience will temper these beginner instincts over time, but there must be easier and less costly ways to identify the proper reaction to competitive price moves than the school of hard knocks. Examine the relative price attractiveness to customers, not the absolute attractiveness, because customers make tradeoffs between offers.Examine the whole offer, not just the price, because, in aggregate, customers will choose offers that deliver them more value after comparing benefits and price. Companies can avoid a debilitating price war altogether by using a set of alternative tactics. Pricing is the easiest strategy and tactic but hardest on the company’s bottom-line. "
14 March 2021,Buying and selling shares on the CSE,"(Part 5 appeared last week)To provide all investors with a secure and well-regulated trading environment, only a licensed Stockbroker can execute transactions on behalf of investors in return for a service fee (brokerage). Other services may include providing research documents which the research team of the particular firm has conducted on the market, to provide investors with the information needed to make an informed decision. Trading in the primary market from a new issue of shares / Initial Public Offering (IPO) Companies typically use a combination of brokering firms, licensed commercial banks and investment banks which advise the company on the IPO (Initial Public Offering), to promote the sale of new shares and distribute the prospectus to potential investors. The CSE website also makes available details on upcoming IPOs and would host the prospectus and the application form. To buy shares: If you wish to buy shares in an IPO, you should first review the prospectus carefully. It would provide you with an in-depth understanding about the company, the industry trends, the manner in which the IPO is structured and salient details of the shares, risks attached, financial statements of the company and other disclosures which are required by law. You will need to open a CDS account through a stockbroker / custodian bank (if you do not have one already) prior to applying for the IPO. A CDS account is required because the CSE’s trading system is fully automated and the paper securities (Share Certificates / Debenture Certificates) should be lodged in the CDS account and translated into an electronic form in order to be traded at the CSE. (When investors buy securities, the account is automatically credited with the securities purchased and the corresponding seller’s account is automatically debited with the same amount.)After you are comfortable about investing, fill out the application form specifying all requisite details including the number of shares you wish to buy and send it to the collection points specified in the Prospectus (usually stockbrokers, the company’s main office or branches and/or branches of specified banks), before the application deadline.To sell shares: once new shares are issued and listed on the CSE, they may trade at a market price substantially different from the issue price (either higher or lower). This is due to supply and demand for the shares of the company. You will need to instruct your Stockbroker to sell your shares in the secondary market. Trading in the secondary market Shares can be bought on the secondary market on any trading day by placing a purchase order through a stockbroker. A secondary market is one in which an investor could either buy or sell shares or other securities from or to another investor, subsequent to the original issuance in the primary market. Liquidity levels of shares are an important consideration as it affects the price you might have to pay and the ease in which you can sell your investment.To trade on the secondary market, you must first contact a stockbroker / custodian bank and open a CDS account through them. Once a CDS account number has been obtained, to buy or sell shares traded on the CSE, your order must be placed with a Stockbroker, typically over the telephone, fax, by visiting or online.Internet tradingInternet trading facilities are available through selected stockbrokers. Online trading provides individual investors with round-the-clock access to the trading system along with market data, company information and educational material. It simplifies the trading process by empowering investors to secure the decision-making power and trade independently.Courtesy: The Colombo Stock Exchange"
12 September 2021,Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka to foster tech entrepreneurs,"The Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), the apex ICT institution of the Government and a catalyst in driving the startup ecosystem forward, launched the ’10,000 Ideas’ national tech innovation program recently to empower the next generation of tech entrepreneurs along with startup ecosystem enablers.Facilitated in collaboration with startup ecosystem enablers and partners for entrepreneurs, ‘10,000 Ideas’ sets the tone to achieve ICTA’s vision of setting up 1,000 tech startups by 2024. ICTA through this initiative supports anyone with an innovative technology-based business idea, from school aged children onwards,who are willing to kick start their entrepreneurship journey by bringing them together to a globally scalable platform for them to come up with innovative ideas, validate a business plan whilst helping them to convert their ideas to successful businesses.ICTA along with the partners hope to generate high quality and globally scalable business ideas from all parts of the country and benchmark global standards for tech entrepreneurship. ICTA will then facilitate these individuals or groups by connecting them further with the ecosystem of partners who will help them through mentoring, training, networking, funding etc.  Chief Digital Economy Officer, ICTA, Anura De Alwis, said, “Tech or tech-enabled businesses have a huge potential to succeed in the global arena with the level of assistance we can offer together with our partners. Our core message is to encourage innovative business ideas as ICTA and our partners are there to guide you in the entrepreneurship journey.This would indeed be a collaborative effort through which we can contribute to the growth of the economy and achieve individual aspirations as well.”While creating a level playing field for more and more ideas to emerge from every corner of the island, ‘10,000 Ideas’ will be instrumental in creating a supportive structure for entrepreneurial activities in Sri Lanka, empowering the community building and education sector with an entrepreneurship-led approach and creating interest in entrepreneurship from the very young ages. IEEE Sri Lanka Section, Student Activities Chair, Dhammika Marasinghe said, “We have implemented numerous ideation-level programs through the strong network of 20 University Student Branches of IEEE Sri Lanka Section, including University Level Hackathons and National Level Programs like IEEE Innovation Nation Sri Lanka. We see that it is necessary to have a sound support system while having their ideas brought up to a recognisable level through mentors via a good standardised framework.“Filling the gap between having an idea and building that up to a product, the ‘10,000 Ideas’ campaign allows future entrepreneurs to rise above the ideation level.This initiative will give start-ups massive support from the ecosystem collaborators of the program. With that, we at IEEE are more than happy to get on board with this initiative hoping to reach towards the common goals of Sri Lanka together,”  he said. Yarl IT Hub, Organising Chair, Yarl Geek Challenge, Ms. Abarna Kirupananda said, “10,000 idea launch is a great start to inspire youth to identify some crucial problems and to find solutions with the help of technology. The structured process which will be introduced through this programme will definitely help someone to bring their ideas to life and start their own venture by providing guidance and mentoring.“After these companies start growing and scaling, they will create a lot of job opportunities. It is also crucial to take this to the rural areas of the island and to work at the grassroot level too,” she said."

12 June 2021,Communicating with customers during the Covid-19 crisis,"Covid-19 has made a gruesome and lasting impact on business activities throughout the world. Unlike the previous similar disasters, this time around, the effect of the virus is spread to virtually every country and territory, letting out ghastly effects. The economies of almost every country in the world experienced negative growth due to the disturbance to global trade activities. In Sri Lanka, although the first wave was contained successfully, the total closure of the country affected tremendously dreadfully all types of businesses, from a roadside boutique to a large-scale exporter. Several months after the opening of the country following the first wave and when the business community started heaving a sigh of relief came the second wave out of the blues. The slowly recovering trade was suppressed again. The second wave also was controlled successfully and business activities became near normal when the horrifying third wave emerged out of public negligence during the New Year.  Hence, the entrepreneurs will be compelled to readjust their strategies again to face the current challenge. The threat of the virus is likely to continue for a considerable period and companies have to find ways and means to communicate with their respective customers and prospects to stay ahead. Clear and preciseBusiness entities should communicate with their customers using clear and precise messages that are compassionate and informational. If the customer feels that the contents of the message are purely business, they may become hostile due to the prevailing crisis. Also, communicating information relevant to the specific customer segment is imperative. Identifying the mode of communication also must be done carefully to avoid misunderstandings.  I have reached out and discussed with several business owners who run different types of product and service lines about the current methods they adopt and their future intentions on communication strategies.  Connecting with customers during a national crisis is a delicate process that must be managed carefully. On one hand, the virus has disrupted the day-to-day lives of customers leading to many hardships on one hand and the fear psychosis on safety on the other. Hence, whatever the message is created, it must be balanced, open, honest, and timely.  The general public that includes your customers is still trying to understand the extent of the problem and cope with the crisis. Understanding the frequency of messages and the space between each of them is an important criterion.  If you overdo it, you may get over-exposed. Overexposure can lead to a feeling that you are attempting to mislead. Effective communication involves the understanding of the preferred frequency and type of message your customers expect. Unless you have major announcements on changes or adjustments to the existing setup, your communication frequency can be regular. However, at this juncture, regularly checking in with customers can be effective without being over-exposed. Some contents should be avoided when communicating with the customers at this time of distress. First and foremost, the message should not be overly exaggerated. The excessive promotional information can lead to a sense of mistrust. Also, the message definitely must not contain politically biased information.  The information delivered to the customers through awareness campaigns must be thoroughly verified for authenticity. Your message must be devoid of any information from doubtful and unreliable sources. More importantly, you must not speak too much about the negative impacts of the pandemic unless your business or product is directly related to the disease.For example, if the message is about an antivirus product, naturally you are compelled to discuss negative impacts. If not, the communication should always be positive.    It is useful to gather as much as possible information from the health authorities on protecting your customers before moving forward with customer communication. The pertinent information can be used as guidance for the customers, employees, and the community. Messages created based on authentic and genuine information are trustworthy and the customers will accept them appreciatively.  Even when the prevailing peak is passed, the dependability of the communication will remain intact in such messages. If this continues, you will appear credible, honorable, and trustworthy to the customers. FierceThe competition in the market is fierce with or without the pandemic. However, it is more so with the existing market limitations, reduced disposable income, and lesser spending power. Therefore, getting in front of every situation is important at this time. Informing customers about the services you provide, products or services available, safety precautions your team is implementing, etc. is extremely useful. Notably, at this point, every customer is more concerned about personal safety than many other criteria.  Hence, your messages to the customers must assure that your services follow health guidelines and the products on offer are totally hygienic. At this stage, you should keep away from messages in terms of up-selling or cross-selling. The messages should be direct, clear, positive, and are aligned with the topic. Indicating the health guidelines you are following with your services and the reasons why these precautions will keep them safe can be constructive. Most likely, your customers are experiencing a deafening noise through social media and obviously suffering from message fatigue. The surge of various types of communications they are constantly receiving has filled up all spaces. More than ever, at present, it is critical to send out the right information to the right person at the right time. Therefore, segmenting your clientele is exceedingly important during this period. Listing out customers and send separate messages to each of the segments is the best method. Once the groups are in place, the messages should be created targeting specific segments to deliver the precise information needed. With a planned action, you can release timely and relevant information based on each segment. The personalisation of communication is extremely effective rather than sending faceless common messages.Both sidesThe prevailing situation is equally stressful to your employees as well. Hence, it is important to understand both sides of the business.   By communicating openly with the employees, you can eliminate their own concerns and also motivate them immensely at this troubled time. Workers themselves are understandably under peer pressure where they have to concentrate on the safety of their own families. Therefore, being in constant touch with them and sharing positive feedback can make them more optimistic. An important factor to keep in mind is that although people are spending more time online, using more content is not a successful communication strategy. Online advertising has many advantages in cost and effectiveness. However, your crisis communication plan must be well-balanced on choosing the correct path. Therefore, it is prudent to encourage those who create content for your company to focus on empathy more than ever before. Breaking down messages to shorter, simpler, and more palatable contents will be appreciated and admired by customers. Also, with more time available, either by lockdowns or voluntary travel restrictions, people tend to focus more on entertainment. Therefore, carefully executed meaningful messages in between entertainment will have more impact.  Entrepreneurs and organizations must realize that both they and their customers collectively are experiencing an uncharted territory. No one has specific or precise answers as yet. Therefore, keeping communications authentic and delivering transparent messages is the key to benefit customers until the health crisis is completely subdued. By keeping customers aligned through the crisis with the company’s vision can assist in easing the transition to a new normal. The new normal social behaviour is expected to be the model in the years to come.  "

15 November 2020,CSE to revamp listing process,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has launched an action plan to address key areas relating to the process of listing a company on the CSE with the objective of enhancing its efficiency thereby better serv the funding needs of companies belonging to the State and the private sectors.The action plan will further simplify the process,eliminate any redundant approval steps, reduce documentation and improve the time to market for companies’ new and follow-on offerings of equity and debt.Measures have already been taken to change listing criteria by offering a wider choice of listing options for companies, further amend the listing rules to enable a simplified process in addition to carrying out changes to internal infrastructure of the CSE to ensure a smoother process workflow. CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando said, “Increasing the number of companies listed on the exchange is one of the CSE’s key strategic objectives. We have to make exponential progress on this front. As businesses approach the post-Covid-19 period, it is likely that funding will be a top priority and we have versatile options available to address the different funding requirements of corporates.“We have put in place systems and processes to cater to an ever-evolving business landscape in Sri Lanka and we stand ready to meet the requirements of our corporate stakeholders. We strongly believe that the steps we are taking to simplify the listing process would attract more companies to raise capital through the CSE helping them unlock value and create wealth for their shareholders,” he said.The CSE has already commenced stakeholder engagement to obtain feedback to carry out further improvements to the CSE’s overall Listing process.Improvements expected from this new CSE plan include the reduction of documentation that has to be submitted with the Listing Application and the removal of certain disclosures in the Prospectus/Introductory Document. In this connection, the CSE will commence discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) to streamline the current dual approval process.Another significant change by the CSE is the introduction of a ‘Single Window’ customer relationship unit that will be set up within the CSE to identify potential listing candidate companies, work with such companies and assist them through the listing process. This will make it easier for companies and their advisors to understand and address any problems faced in the process through a single point of contact.An online tracking tool for all listing applications that have been submitted to the CSE will also be introduced, which would provide Issuers with more transparency in tracking the status of their respective applications and understanding which parties hold primary responsibility at each step of the process. The CSE now offers equity or debt based fundraising options for companies of all sizes, from large conglomerates to SMEs, through versatile listing platforms such as the Main, Diri Savi and Empower Boards.  "
19 April 2020, Latent formula to conquer health crisis effects ,"It is sometimes noticed that you reach the call centre hotline, but the system voice notifies you “All our customer centre representatives are busy at the moment, please wait”. This string of words in today’s context of the New Corona (CoVID-19) crisis expresses the newest initiative of contactless-business.Goods/services supply chains have been shaken and disrupted because of the virus and in the interest of national health most commercial activities, enterprises and merchants’ operations need to temporarily wound up. Nevertheless, it is defining that disruptive technologies are reshaping the trends of businesses and benefits (BB). The study encapsulates visible business realities that unfold and the underlying legal architecture in two essential aspects. Figure 1: Electronic flow of data message between business parties according to the legal framework According to the diagram a contactless business can be achieved in two practical ways. Firstly, the electronic interaction between two computer systems connects originator and recipient. Secondly, the customer and the computer system of the commercial party in which a natural person and legal entity interacts respectively. This is a good approach with value for merchants and consumers too as both parties benefit in infectious environments.Digital commerce and e-signatures Digital signatures are beneficial to every party of the digital business supply chain. E-signatures are unique identification marks embedded on an electronic document. The merchant and contract parties establish authenticity and integrity by the digital signature,  ensuring reasonable security and verification.However, to what level the parties and their intentions can be trusted causes a slight twist in this process. In hand signatures grammatical variations and cognate expressions can be observed. On the flip-side this pattern is not quite evident in digital signatures. Yet the disability does not injure the legal validity of the electronic signature; but could undermine the secure cryptography channel between the buyer and seller. This turning point also explains that the better way to preserve the contactless business contract is by a mechanism that proves the offer and acceptance of the transaction has occurred in a legally enforceable manner. Hybrid benefits through technology platformsMore money-more business thinking is grounded on legal bedrock and has many benefits for parties of the e-contract (electronic contract).The parties of the electronic contract are legally recognised and their actions are valid in the eyes of the law (S. 11 -Electronic Transaction Act 19/2006). While the new business environment encourages minimum human touch as a positive health value, S. 17(d) declares that even though the final contract between customers and automated message systems are not reviewed nor intervened by a company employee and scrutinized; the e-contract will be accepted, valid and enforceable.  Isn’t this a desired benefit over traditional hand-written contracts which are more cumbersome in nature and demotes good health practices too?So the number of times the online customer is on hold at the call centre is how social distancing norms are being actually practiced with deeper meaning.It is in the interest of the customer and wider society with a legally acceptable technological framework and hence the benefits must be managed too. In this backdrop we can perceive “technology integration” and “business-customer synchronisation” as a means of attaining contactless business, commerce and trade.As illustrated the gains of such business arrangement can be expressed in quantifiable values with five levels/variations of realising health benefits.While health benefits are centric to many, the routine of businesses and lives of customers must certainly be sustained. Technology with a legally sound base when managed well can be an asset to combat the health crisis.This will increase the benefits to all stakeholders of the supply chain of goods and services that are essential to humanity in the hour of need. Thereby reinforce the trends of business and benefits.The writer is a senior lecturer specialising in General Management and Legal Studies.

25 July 2021,Customs launches digital signatures for online documents,"Sri Lanka Customs in a landmark initiative to  make the import and export process seamless has partnered with LankaClear to introduce LankaSign digital signatures for online document submission.This was launched under the patronage of State Minister of Finance, Capital Markets and State Enterprise Reforms, Ajith Nivard Cabraal, at the  Sri Lanka Customs auditorium recently.The import/export process has a huge bearing on a country’s Ease of Doing Business index. This is also considered a critical factor in attracting foreign direct investments. For many years, document submission to Sri Lanka Customs was a manual process.Ending this cumbersome and ineffective process, the Customs introduced online document submission following the migration to ASYCUDA World in 2012. However, the use of electronic signatures for the current document submission process was found to be vulnerable in the face of rising cyber security threats worldwide. As a solution, the Customs partnered with LankaClear in introducing LankaSign digital signatures for documents submitted to the Customs.Ajith Nivard Cabraal said, “These types of progressive initiatives would improve the entire business process and ensure Sri Lanka climbs up the Ease of Doing Business index by a few notches.”For the proposed system to work seamlessly, importers, exporter, banks, clearing agents need to sign up online with LankaSign to obtain digital signatures. LankaSign is Sri Lanka’s only commercially operating certification authority approved by the National Certification Authority Task Force, which is the governing body for digital certification service providers in the country. Applauding the efforts of his ICT team at the Customs, Director General of Customs, Maj. Gen. (Retd.) G. Vijitha Ravipriya  said, “The latest automation would immensely benefit the traders to carry out their clearing process with minimal difficulties. It will also help our staff to process the clearing requests in a much more efficient manner with greater security.”Chairman of LankaClear, Dr. Kenneth De Zilwa said, “LankaClear is a successful Public-Private-Partnership that was set up in 2002 initially to clear interbank cheques. In 2006, we setup the first automated Cheque Imaging and Truncation System as the first entity in South Asia and the second in the World to do so.LankaClear has also facilitated automated payments towards customs declarations since 2017 and I am happy to be associated with this latest initiative of the Customs to completely automate the document submission process in a secure and an efficient manner by using LankaSign Digital Signatures.” Deputy Secretary to the Treasury. R. M. P. Rathnayake; Director Payments and Settlement of Central Bank, Dharmasri Kumaratunge and CEO LankaClear, Channa de Silva were also present."
28 February 2021,Deciding what shares to buy,"(Part 3 appeared last week)How do you identify the best stock to buy? If we all knew which companies are going to do well and which ones to stay away from, we would all be millionaires. The stock that you should invest in would depend on multiple factors. This week let’s take a look at the types of shares you may come across in the market, based on a number of factors such as return, value, growth potential, risk and more.Income sharesThese shares provide steady income streams for investors where companies pay regular dividends in comparison to others. When buying these shares the important considerations are, the tax applicable on the dividend, as well as the cost of the shares in comparison to the net dividend paid.Value sharesValue Shares reflect established companies with highly successful businesses and a strong financial position. Investors tend to think of value shares as bargains as they appear inexpensive relative to the earning ability of the company and other fundamental factors. Value shares tend to have low Price-to-Earnings ratios and high Dividend Yields. Long term investors prefer these shares which they often hold over long time periods, until the true value of the share begin to emerge in the form of dividends or an increase in the price of the share. Growth sharesGrowth Shares generally represent companies that have a strong and substantial growth potential. Generally, the progression of these companies is in line with the economic growth of the country. Thus, it typically pays little to no dividends to shareholders. Investors who invest in these shares devote their current income expecting to receive high returns at a later date.Cyclical sharesShares which follow general economic trends and business cycles fall into this category. These shares are issued by companies which are sensitive to business cycles and whose performance is closely tied to general economic trends. Prices of cyclical shares can be volatile as they follow the market expectations of how the general economy would perform or other conditions. Defensive sharesThese are shares that remain stable even under strained economic cycles. Unlike cyclical shares these are not affected by general economic trends. During all phases of the economy, whether it is recession or expansion, companies that provide essentials needed by consumers such as food, fuel, gas and medicine are likely to remain stable. Selecting shares The advice of an investment professional will help you in identifying the share types discussed above. If you want to go at it alone, do educate yourself further using CSE publications. You can also use the following as sources for information: Stockbroker websites and publications Newspapers and business magazines Business programmes on TV and Radio Websites and publications of data vendors such as Reuters, Bloomberg etc. Companies listed on the CSE as per the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) are classified into 10 sectors, 24 industry groups, 67 industries and 156 sub-industries. After having identified which type of share and industry you would buy into, you can go on to individual share selection. As we mentioned in the column last week, talk to your adviser and/or do your own research that can give you a good understanding of the company’s activities and its business situation.Be wary of speculative sharesWhen you are exploring the market and doing research for share selection, be wary of companies which lack financial stability or a good track record in earnings and dividends but appear to be focused on delivering growth fast. If a company’s publicised future growth is not supported by its fundamentals, it can be classified as a high-risk investment. Courtesy: The Colombo Stock Exchange"

28 February 2021,"Teaching, coaching and training sales staff","It is common knowledge that an efficient sales function is one of the most vital aspects for the success of a business. There is plenty of evidence to confirm that the buyers select a vendor and most often make buying decisions according to the skills of the salesperson rather than the price, quality, service, or any other feature.In my long career of over 40 years in selling, I have been engaged in selling diverse products of good and average quality products and services. I have been employed by companies with good after-sales service and mediocre service delivery. During this period, on numerous occasions I have come across skilled salesmen who have proven that skill supersedes almost all other factors in personal selling.    When looking at top-ranking business schools, in Sri Lanka and overseas, the general impression is that the curricula of most of their study programs do not extend adequate importance to sales teachings. Business management courses around the world do not offer instructions on selling knowledge or skills despite the importance of the function.SparseSalesmen mostly learn selling skills either from their superiors or occasional training sessions. The interest in teaching selling in an orderly manner in most of the Sri Lankan small and medium level businesses is sparse or almost non-existent. Instead, there are many popular teaching programs for sales management, marketing management, business leadership, business management, and so forth. However, the important factor to consider is that selling and management are two different aspects. I strongly believe that selling is an applied skill and the best performance of a salesman comes with experience. The mere learning of theories are not sufficient. Similar to learning to ride a bicycle, the real knowledge comes from trying, failing, trying again and succeeding. Therefore, as a career salesman, I believe that managing a sales team effectively can be done successfully when the leader has practical on the job experience rather than theoretical knowledge.   Until the 1980s, sales education was simply based on personality development and product knowledge. Salesmen were hired based on the personality and the product knowledge was usually provided by a senior. Organised sales training sessions were occasional and conducted in a few large companies. People skills were not considered teachable in any conventional sense. Their job was to walk up to a customer in a friendly, confident manner and present the features and benefits of a product or service to close a sale. Sales coaching is a strategy used by companies to improve the skills of salespeople on an individual basis. This is a deeply personalised approach where the behaviour of salespersons are analysed to guide them individually to succeed in their role as salesmen. Rather than improving the team as a group, the method focuses on a single salesperson at a time to enhance performance. Sales coaching predominantly concentrate on individual goals and aspirations, giving a future for the salesman to work on. It is a learning experience derived from the one-to-one and day-to-day work of a single salesperson.Staff retentionThis method is directly associated with their personal development, career advancement, and personal achievements. Coaching ensures the performance of the individual and subsequently contributes to the success of the organisation. Sales coaching also leads to the elevation of individual performance and sales staff retention.When the sales staff is aware of the personal benefits, not only their morale escalates but also they tend to be more loyal to the organisation. Hence, sales coaching is a good remedy for sales staff turnover. Sales training, on the other hand, focuses on the whole sales team to educate them about common aspects such as selling skills, time management, teamwork, products and competition. Usually, the entire sales staff including seniors participates in these group sessions. Currently, most companies invite the customer service and other back-up staff members to participate to share knowledge about the sales process.  Irrespective of the mixture of the training audience, group settings lead to connect other departments that provide support services to the sales team. The advantage is that the participants who work towards a common goal can use one another as a resource to exchange valuable knowledge, and experiences. If properly designed, training sessions can be extremely effective brainstorming sessions as well. Sales training in an organisation is effective because such sessions focus on the common goal of the organisation. Sales training sessions also directly educate participants on sales skills development and sales knowledge development. While coaching concentrates more on individual skills,  behaviour, and knowledge, training sessions provide a deeper insight into the company›s overall objectives.  Therefore, sales training is directly aligned with overall organisational goals. With rapidly developing technology and the constantly changing sales landscape, sales training is an absolute necessity for companies of every size to sustain sales efficiency. Training ensures that the staff, both direct and back-up to keep-up with the existing fierce competition. The reality is that if an organisation is not competent and exceedingly competitive from the sales perspective, success can be far-reaching. CoachingSales teams need a mix of coaching and training.  At the initial stage of a sales career in a company, a salesperson needs to extensively understand important knowledge related criteria such as products to be sold, company knowledge, competition, industry, and general economic conditions. This information can be conveniently given only through a team training session as such information is common to the entire staff, including the sales team. Information provided to a group of people effectively keeps everyone on the same page.  Sales coaching, on the other hand, provides more individualistic insights into the sales effort. Coaching is an interactive process to help individuals to develop skills to produce better results. Sales coaching should be done by a senior member of the sales team, ideally the sales manager.The constant presence of the coach is essentially required as, unlike training, the coaching must be done as frequently as possible. This effort creates a true partnership between the coach and the salesperson due to the relentless two-way conversation, making the coaching a powerful tool.  In the realm of selling, at present, the buyer is newly empowered because of the existence of the internet. Customers no longer need a salesperson to learn about the company, products, or promotions. Nevertheless, even with the availability of numerous online platforms, many customers prefer to visit brick and mortar and discuss with sales staff when purchasing goods. As existed decades ago, even today, when customers purchase industrial products, customers prefer to invite salespeople to make presentations.      While, teaching, coaching, and training are fundamentally different, all three functions are important components for successful sales performance. The ultimate intention of all three actions is to generate more revenue for the company and to help the development of professional skills and knowledge of each sales staff member. Sales training is a great first measure to educate the sales team members. In contrast, sales coaching is a reliable method of enhancing the job performance of the individual salesperson. "
25 July 2021,Internal and external communication in business,"Various schools of thought about business communications exist in society. Some say that it is identifying opportunities and exploiting them whilst others claim that it is about the connections or recruiting the best people and prepare them for the business world. No doubt that all these elements are essential. However, in my opinion as an experienced business executive, effective communication is one of the major elements that outdo many others in the success of an organisation. Strong communication, more than many other factors, can be a leading and key element in business success. Communication powerfully contributes to all other aspects of a business. In a business, it helps effectively to deal with employees, customers, partners, and virtually all other stakeholders. A good communication model in an organisation also can assist in finding new opportunities, increase industry awareness, cultivating connections, and maintain the best organisational culture.The process of transferring information from a person to the other or one group to another, both internal and external, is termed business communication. Certainly, other definitions and elaborations do exist in the business world. However, to explain in simple words, the term is derived from general communication that is associated with the business activities of a single organisation. In other words, effective communication between parties or people on business-related aspects is called business communication. Variety of topicsTypically business communication is used to promote a business, product, or service on one hand and also is used to relay information within an operating business. This involves a variety of topics such as marketing, advertising, promotions, and relationship management. Internal communication refers to internal interaction within an organisation’s management and employees. Internal communications within the organisation include formal and informal exchanges of information, ideas, instructions, or messages. The internal exchange between employees and the management at different levels is effective and is a vital source of viewing, representing, and solving organisational issues related to the business.  The biggest advantages of effective internal business communication are the increase of job satisfaction levels, productivity, and the overall efficiency of the employees. Internal communication can be initially divided into two categories. The first is the ‘internal upward’ that involves the communication flow from the bottom of the hierarchy to the upper management.  For example, the information gathered through the sales team via various reports regularly is communicated to the higher management as briefs. This helps the top management to understand the ground-level issues on any related criteria. The information in turn helps the management to make important decisions on business-associated matters to improve the revenue of the company.  Bottom-up communication plays an important role where subordinates find an opportunity to transmit their views on a business or even a personal issue to the hierarchy.  Also, the top management can obtain timely feedback, new and creative suggestions, official or personal requests, and any other escalating concerns. The downward internal communication also is equally important where the upper management can pass on their views, instructions, guidelines, policies, and other management information to the employees at lower levels, relating to doing their assigned tasks.  Typically the messages of the management are passed through a chain of hierarchy to obtain optimum effectiveness.  Successful motivatorFor example, a warning letter from the company is communicated to the employee through the HR department via the immediate superior to keep everyone involved informed. The internal downward communication can either be oral or written, communicated through memorandums, notices, emails, short messages, or face-to-face conversations.   Internal communication, if used correctly and timely, is a successful motivator for employees. Perhaps, this can be a better alternative than motivation by offering financial benefits. It can also enhance the job-related decision-making capability of employees. Communication plays a crucial role in supporting employees to build social bonds where they can be encouraged in teamwork practices. It is proven that staff with strong social bonds perform with increased efficiency with better team spirit.Lateral communication is the exchange of information among co-workers through verbal and written messages or discussions. The horizontal or lateral inter-departmental and cross-department communication allows the employees of the same level to communicate important matters among themselves. For example, a standard management meeting held between managers can discuss or exchange information on marketing, production, administrative, and other common business issues. Usually, successful companies depend on the minutes of such meetings in addition to encouraging written communication among managers.RevenueExternal communication is the effort of an organisation to communicate with people and other outside organisations about the business, its products, and/or services.  External communications focus on spreading the news effectively to target audiences including customers, suppliers, service providers, and any other stakeholder linked to the business. The key goals of external communication are to increase revenue on one hand and to minimise costs on the other.  Common examples of external communications include advertising and promotion efforts, press releases, publications, newsletters, digital campaigns, websites, and so forth.Public perception is an extremely vital ingredient in a business. It is as important as the bottom line. Effective business communication is the most important aspect of shaping the image of an organisation to the society at large (societal impressions can be vital to a company in the long run) and to its own existing and prospective customers, possible investors, and other stakeholders. Every external communication effort helps the company to make the public aware of the products, services, locations, and any other important information.  Perhaps the most important function of external business communication is that it finds new customers.The main goal of external communication is to find customers, sell products or services, obtain revenue, and increase profits for the survival and growth of the business. One exceedingly important factor to consider seriously is the possibility of the public back clash when using interactive technology such as social media.  One negative comment can initiate a chain reaction detrimental to the image of a perfectly good organisation. Such damage to the image cannot easily be reversed in a short time. However, the benefits of new technologies that are far-reaching and make an organisation communicable with large audiences in communications outweigh the risks by a considerable margin.   Modern communication practices compel companies to use digital media as much as possible to reach customers. While external business communication is the key to reaching out to the public, it has challenges, if not communicated extremely cautiously.If the public perception is damaged through a bad message or misplaced quote, it can be costly.  Therefore, when choosing and designing external communication programs, the organisation has to be extra careful with its audience preferences.  Companies use strategies such as developing web content, Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), and content marketing to communicate with outsiders on important information. Through effective content marketing, companies can ensure the visibility of their websites. Through two-way communication flow by way of comments and other feedback from viewers, organisations can amend, adjust or create business strategies.  In every type of organisation, small, large, private, or public, communication plays a vital role. This is the reason for the phrase ‘good communication leads to good business’ is looming around. The efficient performance of an organisation largely depends on communication effectiveness, internal and external. It helps the organisation in business grow while enhancing the morale and motivation of employees that minimise internal and external conflicts. "
10 May 2020,Closure of market will not help revival - Experts,"Keeping the market open even during challenging times, clarity on the macroeconomic front, expanding the size of the market and protecting it from unscrupulous elements are key to drive capital market growth, said market experts proposing urgent measures to revive the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).Colombo Stock Brokers Association Past President  Ravi Abeysuriya said  foremost it is vital to open the CSE for trading despite the tough times and added that price discovery and liquidity being fundamentals of a free market will not function when the market is closed. The consequential long-term reputational damage to the Exchange will be enormous.“The capital market in Sri Lanka has ceased to be an avenue for companies to raise debt and equity and avoid being overly dependent on the banking system thus vulnerable to economic shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic,” Abeysuriya said, adding that a deep and liquid capital market helps companies to raise long-term capital needed to finance their businesses which in turn contributes to increasing overall economic growth.He said it is imperative that the government understands the role of the capital market and make  structural changes for it to function properly. Underscoring the need to address the two major challenges facing the CSE such as  its small size and lower liquidity, Abeysuriya said solving the ‘size and liquidity’ issues are critical to unlocking the potential of the CSE and needs bold and visionary supply and demand side reforms. On the supply side, he said listing of viable State institutions are necessary to increase the size of the stock market to a measurable degree. On the demand side, captive investors such as EPF, ETF, NSB, SLIC should invest in fundamentally strong companies in broadly diversified portfolios that match subscriber risk and return preferences will generate sustainable demand and liquidity for investing and trading of securities.“Stock markets globally have reacted to the  pandemic with unprecedented volatility, unpredictability with large market drops, triggering circuit breakers repeatedly. No previous infectious disease outbreak, including the Spanish Flu, has impacted the stock market as powerfully as Covid-19,” Abeysuriya said, adding that no company is immune to the challenges caused by the health crisis, and there are understandable concerns about the damage caused to the world economy.JB Securities  (Pvt) Ltd., Managing Director Murtaza Jafferjee, sharing similar sentiments, said  the CSE must be kept open  in good and bad times  adding that Sri Lanka is the only country which has kept the markets closed for over six weeks.“We must protect our capital market institutions, make them independent and ensure that a few unscrupulous elements are unable to manipulate or capture these institutions for their own agendas.“In the short term the outlook remains bearish, as  the pent up selling pressure  will force down prices. The short-term outlook for earnings too looks poor especially for the leisure and banking sectors which will have to absorb the interest forgone during the moratorium period,” Jafferjee said, adding that leading into this crisis valuations were at the bottom end of their range and what was cheap will become cheaper.He said over the past decade fixed income and land were the preferred asset classes with returns over 150 percent while equities returned only around 60 percent. Land prices after many years will probably go down and financial repression will force down interest rates to probably negative real rates which will make equities a more attractive asset class.On the prospects of a revival of the market, he said taking a cue from overseas markets we will see a sharp fall which will then gradually recover as the curfew is lifted and the economy starts recovering.“Equity markets operate better when uncertainty reduces. However, the country needs clarity on the macroeconomic front with regard to the support from the IMF, status of the G20 moratorium and future fiscal policy especially  on taxation.He noted that the market will also look for clarity on the political front, legal standing on spending and borrowing after the appropriation period, will Parliament be convened after June 2 and when polls will be held. The news flow will probably drive the market on a day-to-day basis.The CSE introduced a slew of relief measures to boost the market which would help players to comply with certain regulatory requirements of the Exchange.The measures include extension of the deadline to submit unaudited financial statements, compliance officers’ reports and Unit Trust returns for the months of March, April and May this year by three weeks from the stipulated time and for the submission of audited financial statements by two months for the financial years ending December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020.The submission of annual and interim reports for Unit Trust funds has been extended by two months.  "
5 July 2020,SEC approves amendments to Listing Rules,"The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC SL) has approved the introduction of new rules and amendments to the Listing Rules of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and granted approval in principle to proceed with certain other important initiatives.These rules are expected to improve regulatory efficiency, and streamline the process for more companies such as SMEs and start–ups to list and access capital.The SEC granted approval to the following:a. Expansion of the current eligibility criteria by allowing applicant entities to satisfy any one of the following tests:b.• Method I: Profit and net assets test; • Method II: Revenue and market capitalisation test; • Method III: Positive operating cash flow and market capitalisation test.These eligibility criteria will facilitate companies which do not have a large asset base but have substantial revenue and cash flows (such as companies in the IT sector) to consider the capital market for their funding needs.b. Provide flexibility to the issuer to decide on the allotment basis when the value of an Initial Public Offering (IPO) is over Rs. 3 billion subject to CSE agreeing to the proposed allotment basis.c. Reduce the timeframe for an applicant entity to refund payments due on fully/partly rejected IPO applications and credit investors’ Central Depository System (CDS) accounts with the securities allotted to improve efficiency.d. Extend the timeframe to open the Subscription List for an IPO. II. Introduce new Listing Rules on amalgamation.The SEC granted approval to the following initiatives in principle:• Policy revision to consider removal or relaxation of the present Listing Rule, which imposes a restriction on total value of other class of shares that can be issued to accommodate the interest of certain investors who prefer other class of shares outside ordinary voting shares.• Extend the Multi Currency Board (MCB) facilities to local companies intending to list Debt in foreign MCB to allow more avenues to raise capital via CSE.• Other requirements applicable to overseas companies to be listed on the MCB specifically applicable to selected overseas jurisdictions.• Extend timelines in relation to Enforcement Rules on the Empower Board and permit companies affiliated to external audit firms of the applicant entity to act as sponsors subject to meeting criteria."
8 August 2021,Selecting employees for promotion,"We are doing business in turbulent times. The pandemic has affected organisations operationally and financially. The corona outbreak has caused bankruptcy to many companies including many leading companies locally and globally.But those who are optimistic in their view to mobilise, stabilise and get back to normalcy in their businesses in the near future may be planning for expansion and intending to promote their employees for managerial or higher positions in their organisations or else hire from outside the company. At present, this may ideally suit the companies that market  products and services that aids to prevent and recover from the ‘perilous’ Covid-19.  As the head of the company it may be an arduous task when it comes to appointing a suitable person for the managerial position or other job promotions in your organisation. In striving to appoint the perfect candidate, most times it may be an uphill battle for you and the management in arriving at a good decision.You may have two or more potential candidates lined up for the new position. Among many other possible consequences of appointing the candidate of your choice, one definite outcome may be the candidates who are not selected, decide to leave your  organisation.Hence, you have to focus on retaining all the candidates and  move forward to meet your current and future goals and objectives of your organisation with your decision to appoint the suitable candidate. You may wonder how to handle the job promotion aspect in your organisation in a ”felicitous manner”, hence, I am penning down my words to benefit you and the organisation.Act rationallyWhen promoting an employee please do not look into the criteria of a perfect candidate. Instead focus on an ideal candidate as perfectionism does not exist in the business world. When promoting an employee, you should think and act rationally and avoid being emotional. As a prerequisite you should do a performance appraisal for each employee whom you wish to promote in your organisation. The documentation associated with performance appraisals can clearly demonstrate that decisions on such matters as work assignments, transfers, job enlargements, job rotations, job enrichments and promotions, and raises can be made on the basis of performance and merit.When making appraisals incorporate the following for the successful selection of the employee for promotion:First and foremost he or she should have a good work ethic. In other words he or she should be dedicated, determined, disciplined, punctual, obedient, loyal and follow the directions given by you and the management. He or she should be a dynamic, vibrant and pleasing personality. In these pandemic ridden times the ideal candidate should have the ability to foresee change or change with change and manage changes effectively and efficiently to the benefit of his or her organisation. Second, he or she should be able to manage crises and nullify its effects to protect oneself, the team and organisation. Thirdly he or she should be able to resolve conflicts that may arise when managing the team and business.Hence, the ideal candidate has to be proficient in change, crisis and conflict management. Among the other requirements for promotion, the potential candidate should be a visionary person, able to effectively communicate upwards, downwards, laterally and externally, able to consistently prioritise work and meet deadlines, manages time well and have the ability to motivate, inspire and persuade others, have positive thinking and positive attitude, work  well with the team and consistently put the team’s best interest ahead of his own and  ability to understand, tolerate  and help team members and should have patience, and teach the team mates.He or she should work hard and smart to get the desired results for the company. He or she has to contribute to the “growing growth of the Company” and thereby be a productive employee to the organisation. He or she should manage successes, handle failures and learn from mistakes and focus on  his or her “continuous professional education”.He should also continuously develop him or herself and possess a “growth mindset” and prove his or her worthiness for future work and promotions. He or she should be “solution oriented” and not part of the problem, but rather a “partner in progress and prosperity” and should help to meet the goals and objectives to fulfill or realise the vision and mission of the company.Finally, the entire activity has to be cost efficient and you should be able to provide a successful career pathway to the successful employees in your organisation.The promotion given to your employee should reflect in the “bottom line” of your business in the Medium and, or long term. Bottom line refers to your business’s net income, net earnings, or net profit.Do not wait for opportunities to recommence or develop your businesses.It is something like waiting for the waves to seize to swim or catch fish. Should there be no opportunities, create one. When there are opportunities there will always be challenges. Hence, equip yourself to meet the “challenges and opportunities” to navigate your business in 2021 and beyond. The writer is a professional marketeer and an inspirational speaker. "
2 August 2020,"Selling, a noble profession","Good selling is a noble profession, honourably entrenched with truth, trust, and honesty. The world has recognised the essential role of sales and respects men and women who do this difficult and important job well. Many people around the world believed the old but deserved connotation salespeople were branded with decades ago. Today, this implication is true only with bad and unskilled salesmen. Author and international sales expert Patrick Ellis, in his famous book ‘Who Dares Sells’ describes professional selling as a war played out on the business battlefield. According to him, a salesman is a trained marksman who shoots with precision and accuracy in the battle of business competition. Selling is the one game that pays bills, salaries, and keeps the doors open, thus making it everyone’s business. This is an activity in which the person applies his specialised knowledge and skill and goes far beyond the product or the service on offer.  Therefore, companies need sales to survive, and usually reward and pay highly to retain good salespeople.I had been engaged in selling during my entire career of over forty years. Irrespective of the designation, not only I was proud to announce that ‘I am a salesman’ wherever I went but also received numerous opportunities by way of financial gains and career recognition.Interacting with customers provided me with a substantial power base in many spheres where I helped others in many ways, regardless of whether a sale was made or not. Therefore, I personally believe that being in sales is always challenging and sometimes strenuous, but it is the most rewarding and the most fulfilling profession in the world.  Let us see why. First and foremost, the control you can have during working hours. Unlike many other professions, a salesman, unless working in a retail store, makes his own appointments and makes his own journey plans. Your boss will gladly approve it as long as you produce results during a specified period. Better results come when you work harder, smarter and longer. The freedom of the job of a salesman is universally accepted and widely practised. It is almost like running your own business.OpportunitiesThroughout their career, salesmen enjoy limitless opportunities compared to the vast majority of professions anywhere in the world because every company needs salesmen to generate revenue. Hence, when you become a professional and skilled salesperson and master the art and science of selling, the product or service offered to sell does not become an issue.All you have to do is to comprehensively study the product that has to be sold. Another advantage is that you can obtain employment in any field of interest by using your selling skills.  Salespeople engage themselves and interact with a variety of people. A professional salesman never loses contact with a customer even if he or she is unable to close a deal. Imagine the number of contacts you will possess after working for several years. If you manage a customer properly in a sale, the relationship can last decades.Your continuous communications with various types of customers will give you immense experience and knowledge about human behaviour. On the other hand, day-to-day dialogues with customers will make the job interesting and enjoyable and this diversity will never lead you to boredom. Another salient factor in a sales career is unmatched job security. Almost all business entities view their sales team as their greatest asset. Sales team members are well-compensated not because of their individualities but because they bring valuable revenue to the organisation to survive and grow.Salesmen help pay the salaries of the others including the owners of the organisation by generating income and profits and keep the doors open for the others. Hence, companies protect and retain good salespersons as there is always a scarcity of them everywhere in the world.A skilled salesman, with a good track record, always has the opportunity to obtain employment elsewhere if he or she so desires. This is a luxury that does not exist in many other professions. By being in sales as a professional makes you a better person in the eyes of society. Although the statement may be hard to believe for someone looking from the outside, when salesmen continuously engage in interpersonal relationships with customers, they automatically develop empathy that is one of the most vital factors in the selling profession.Empathy leads you to understand others better. This is a highly sensitive instrument that can be used in society and earn the respect of fellow peers. A sales team in an establishment carries minimal personal controversies and animosities among each other in comparison to people  in other professions. This is due to the empathy the team develops and the team spirit  they usually contain.  Salespeople encounter something new all the time. They are more fortunate than many others with careers that may lead to harmful monotony fatigue.They constantly get involved in different sales situations and different customers. Hence, the job of a salesperson is fresh and never becomes stale. They meet new people, travel to new places, engage in a wide variety of scenarios different from one another. Personally to me, this is fun and I have enjoyed it throughout my career. ChallengeA sales career is filled with swift and tangible accomplishments. Unlike many other situations, the results of the effort are clearly defined and it is also measurable. The value they bring to the organisation can be seen instantly. On occasions, quick performance measurement can be a discouraging factor for a salesman as the failures too can be seen instantaneously.However, professional, skilled and trained salespeople take failures as a challenge. Good salespersons believe in ‘ego drive’ where they keep pursuing a predetermined goal even amidst continuous failures. Ego-driven individuals chase behind victory in an intensely personal manner.  The good news is that extroverts and introverts as described by Swiss-born psychoanalyst Carl Jung can be successful in the selling profession. This ends the common impression retained for decades that salesmen are talkative, sociable and fun-loving but deceitful people who will clinch a deal by any means.The era of cigar smoking, joke-telling, and back slapping as in Arthur Miller’s famous stage play ‘Death of a salesman’ is gone.Both types of personalities can be trained to be successful salespersons.There is no difference between an introvert whose energies are directed inward and has soft behaviour or an extrovert who is more outward and more assertive. In fact, in my long career with sales teams, I have come across numerous successful members who are suave and soft-spoken.      If one looks at the newspaper employment opportunities columns or any of the recruitment agency websites, anyone can witness that more vacancies are available for sales related jobs than any other field of work. The reason is that there is heavy scarcity of sales personnel, particularly in field sales. As one of the most rewarding professions in the world, any interested youngster will have ample opportunities out in the market with limitless compensation. "
19 January 2020,Staff training is essential for business sustainability,"Virtually, every entrepreneur knows the significance of staff training for the sustainable growth of a business. However, while almost all big companies heavily concentrate on staff training and development, medium and small business entities in Sri Lanka largely ignore this salient need. Workforce training is an indispensable way to keep an organization competitive.Staff training provides many benefits. Among them are subject knowledge and the motivational aspect and the encouragement it offers to the employee. A properly designed training program allows you to strengthen the skills and attitudes that each staff member needs to improve. This helps reduce any weak links within the company that rely heavily on others to complete basic work tasks.As an experienced business executive, over the years I have observed a very clear training need in small and medium business establishments. Many of these entrepreneurs customarily pay no attention to the importance of the matter either due to ignorance or due to unawareness.These businessmen do not realise that training has become the catchword in the Sri Lankan fiercely competitive market environment. The fact is that a professional and well trained team achieves short and long term benefits.Periodical training programs boost morale of staff. Training helps the employee to get job security and job satisfaction. The more satisfied the employee is and the greater is his morale, the more he will contribute to organisational success. Feeling of inadequacy, underachievement, boredom and unfriendly negative outlook is dispelled. It also positively enhances productivity of the organisation.I have singled out two key aspects, apart from the subject matter, in training in a business entity. Firstly, the attitude and approach of the staff towards the customer and secondly the overall selling performance of the entire staff. A sale is a collective effort although salesmen have the primary responsibility. Quoting an anonymous poem, Famous author who published ‘Who Dares Sell’ states “Selling is Everyone’s Business. When it is not you are in trouble”. This is an absolutely accurate and realistic declaration.For instance, take the attitude of staff of any private Bank or Supermarket. Rarely a customer experiences a staffer with a negative outlook. They are cordial and helpful whenever a customer requires a service. Their standpoint to customer, irrespective of the job title, is comprehensively positive mostly as they are abundantly well trained in customer relations. This is applicable to most of the private business establishments.The entire market comes up against a serious issue with regard to the availability of field sales staff. Youth today extends a totally lackluster approach to the profession. In good old days, when I was a sales representative, we were convinced by seniors that selling is a specialized profession with unlimited potential to make money and for career growth as well.Many young men become salesmen today because of the amply available job opportunities in the market. However, vast majority of them ditch the job in a short time unless the employer makes a deliberate effort to encourage them and instill enthusiasm. Therefore, an effective induction program initially and useful subsequent periodical training programs will keep the all important sales force going successfully. There is a dire need for training of employees in any and every workplace whether it is big or small. Training improves staff capabilities, skills, knowledge and positive attitudes. Training makes the staffer more confident and positive and makes organization stay ahead of competition. "
10 January 2021,Tourism pilot project will open doors for business as usual,"The former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia, UdayangaWeeratunga, the brainchild behind the tourism pilot project launched at the end of December 2020 said the Covid-19 health protocols that are in place is a key hurdle when bringing down high-end foreign tourists.The pilot project based on the ‘travel bubble’ concept where tourist groups travel according to a pre-planned itinerary approved by the Government was launched to identify shortcomings in the process that should be rectified before opening the country to welcome commercial and charter flights officially. The Government anticipates to do this by about January 23, though the date hasn’t yet been confirmed.Weeratunga told the Sunday Observer that he had the confidence to bring down 44,000 tourists from nations of the former Soviet Union. Since the launch of the project, flights carrying nearly 750 Ukrainian tourists have arrived at the Mattala International Airport in five flights by January 7. Twelve charter flights carrying tourists will arrive in the country under this pilot project which is due to end by January 19.Excerpts of the interview:Q: Why was Ukraine chosen as the destination to bring down tourists in the pilot project? Weren’t there other options?A. The first flight from Russia was due to land here on December 26 but that flight was cancelled. The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairperson, Kirmali Fernando translated the health guidelines into Russian and sent them to the tour operators in Russia, after which the flights were cancelled.But Ukraine was willing to send their citizens to Sri Lanka despite the restrictions that were put in place. I spoke to the two airlines and they were willing to be a part of this project.We wanted to do this as a promotion. To make this project successful I spoke to everyone including the hotels and the Mattala International Airport officials to provide their services at a concessionary rate.Q: There is a plan to bring 500 German tourists to Sri Lanka. Are you involved in this too? Do you think it would be successful?A. No, I am not involved in this. Bringing tourists to the country is not an easy task. I challenge anyone to come forward and do this.Q: Do you think the pilot project was successful?A. The last charter flight in the pilot project is due to land on January 19. Thereafter, they will continue to bring tourists to the country in the normal way. This project was very important because, for the first time we have international tourists coming directly to the Mattala International Airport. That didn’t happen before.I think the pilot project was successful. But at the last minute the Tourism Board created issues and we had to cancel several tours. The tour group that came on December 28 and 29 left on January 7 and only half of them got the chance to visit Yala.With the health guidelines that are in place we can’t bring tourists to the country. If the tourists are willing to travel in a bubble, we have to give them special consideration. Even the guidelines issued on January 6 are not hundred percent satisfactory.Q: The way the Ukraine tourists conducted themselves was criticised. People said they were acting irresponsibly. What do you have to say about this?A. These tourists come in a group, like a family. They sit in a flight together for 14-16 hours, and are transported together. They even stay in the same rooms. But, during the next excursion the tourists will wear face masks.Only two of these tourists tested positive for Covid-19. They are receiving medical assistance in their hotels. Even though seven tested positive for the virus, five of them were later cleared.Q: Do you think we can officially restart tourism on January 26?A. The travel bubble project was initiated for us to get first-hand experience in restarting tourism. We had several issues such as the Yala incident. We have identified them and we need to find ways to rectify them.This is the best time to do this because people in European nations travel during the winter period. That ends in March-April. If we don’t do this now, we have to wait till September.The tourism industry is already crippled as employees have started to find alternate jobs to support themselves financially. The Association of Small and Medium Enterprises in Tourism (ASMET) said they welcome the Government’s plan to officially restart tourism by the end of this month. A further delay, they said would completely paralyse the once flourishing industry.ASMET president M B Jayarathna said that other tourist destinations are already welcoming tourists, and that Sri Lanka has to follow suit.Commending the tourism pilot project, he said there could be mistakes, but what is important is to rectify them and continue. “We are losing our tourists. We have to start bringing them here keeping the health guidelines in mind,” he said.The Ministry of Health issued new guidelines for the tourism industry this week.This included a per-confirmed hotel booking of up to 14 days, a negative PCR test taken 96 hours before boarding, and a mandatory stay at a safe and secure certified (level 1) hotel during the first 14 days. They are also to travel under a ‘bio-security bubble’.Senior council member of ASMET Rohan Abeywickrema expressed dissatisfaction at the Sri Lanka Tourism Chairperson, Kirmali Fernando allegedly failing to support the tourism pilot project. He said she was planning to open the country to high-end tourists. “We don’t have rooms to cater to the up market. We should give VIP service to them, but we can’t do that,” he said adding that the Chairperson has to listen to the private sector that ‘runs’ the travel trade.He commended the government and the health authority for the pilot project. “Even the repatriation flights came during this time”, he said adding that tourism and repatriation of migrant workers can be handled parallelly.“We are very happy that they are opening the country for everyone. From the beginning the SLTDA opened to high end tourism. They were not targeting the SMEs of the country,” Prabuddha Jayasinghe another senior council member of ASMET said adding that they welcome wholeheartedly, the move to bring in tourists."
4 April 2021,"Clearing misconceptions, key to boost equity market listings","The Stock Exchange is a powerful tool that should be leveraged by corporates as a viable alternative to the traditional lending sector. However, certain misconceptions about listing have dissuaded investors coming to the Exchange, said Head of Origination and Issuer Relations at Colombo Stock Exchange, Purasisi Jinadasa in an interview with the Sunday Observer Business last week. Excerpts of the interviewQ: The stock exchange is one of the methods to access funding in Sri Lanka. Can you comment on this?A: The stock market is a powerful tool that should be leveraged by companies and seriously considered as an alternative to the traditional lending sector. However, there seems to be a few misconceptions surrounding listing which need to be addressed. Q: What are the most common misconceptions?A: The most common include the cost of listing, stringent disclosure requirements, prohibitory governance structures, loss of control and possible loss of intellectual property. With regard to cost, what an Issuer will find is that raising capital via the exchange is generally cheaper over the long-run than accessing debt capital via the traditional methods. Depending on which Board the Issue is listed, the cost over a 10-year period can be as little as Rs. 10 mn. Further, the added benefit is the less restrictive nature of accessing capital – no interest or capital repayments and no need for collateral. Disclosure and governance requirements are another concern. However, if one evaluates the regulations, the requirements are only incremental. Most of the disclosures will be ones that are generally communicated to an unlisted company’s controlling shareholders and existing Board, while governance looks at a couple of additional independent directors. These requirements are solely to safeguard minority shareholder interests post listing. Loss of control is a common point brought up frequently. This misconception probably stems from experiences by family owned businesses that went about the process to list in an unstructured manner. If a structured process is followed, the family can continue to execute its vision post-listing. In terms of listing requirements, depending on the Board a company chooses, there is a minimum public shareholding requirement.However, the highest would be applicable to the Main Board and is only 20% if the market capitalisation is less than Rs. 2.5 bn. If it is higher, then the required public holding percentage falls. Therefore, the family and/or owners continue to retain 80% even at the highest requirement, which translates to effective control of the company. There are also other mechanisms that can be employed to prevent dilution of the family stake in the business.Loss of the ‘secret ingredient’ that makes the business successful is also a fallacy. If you take practical examples from around the world, you will see that the largest listed companies continue to dominate its sectors despite being listed. In fact, the latest study done by the University of St. Gallen and EY depicts that 50% of the top 20 global companies by revenue are listed and continue to be family controlled. There is no requirement for companies to divulge intellectual property or other sensitive information that will place the operations at a disadvantage compared to an unlisted competitor. In fact, by listing, a company is likely to perform much better as it attracts seasoned professionals who invigorate the innovation process.Q: What are the benefits of listing?A: One of the primary benefits is the diversification you would achieve in terms of funding options. Your company is no longer restrained by lending conditions and you are better able to reach your optimal capital structure. There is also a benefit due to price discovery. Through an IPO, the owners will be able to better gauge the value of the company. Apart from the benefit attributable to financing lines, the owners now have a mechanism to exit if their priorities lie elsewhere and enable them to diversify their wealth. Finally, the two points mentioned earlier, which include attracting and retaining top talent via the ability to provide part ownership in the company as well as due to proper governance structures that top talent can rely on for effective business practices. Q: How would a family business begin the process of listing?A: One of the first steps that family-owned or even closely held entities that have had success post-listing have done is to establish clear governance structures to address family matters. This is generally done by establishing a family council and a constitution which will govern how the family chooses to run the business through the generations. Following the above process, the potential Issuer will seek to engage an Investment Bank which will look at business readiness in terms of an IPO. This process will assess the current governance structures and other aspects of the business against the listing requirements. This will be followed by the determination of the valuation and finalisation of the listing application. Once the application is received by the exchange, the approval to list should not take more than 4 weeks. Q: The engagement of an Investment Bank seems to be an essential part of the listing process. How should an Issuer go about choosing one?A: I would suggest the Issuer take this part of the process as equally important, as the Investment Bank has a large part in the success of the IPO, as well as the future success of the company once listed. In determining an appropriate partner, things to consider are past track record, ability to properly develop and articulate the business strategy and future goals as well as willingness to remain an active partner post-listing.Part of the application process will include the completion of a Prospectus, which will outline what the management expects to do with the funds raised and more importantly, the company’s future growth strategy. For a large part, those points will determine the ultimate valuation as well as the types of investors you attract for your IPO. The proper articulation of future prospects and achieving those targets post-listing will also ensure the share price remains strong and that the company can continue to access capital via the exchange for future needs.Q: What platforms are available at the CSE for companies to raise capital?A: At the exchange, we have three boards on which companies can list given its funding needs and stage of growth. The Empower board is for nascent businesses seeking to grow, while the Diri Savi and the Main Board are generally for mid to larger established companies. The rules and regulations applicable to each of the Boards takes into account the needs of the Issuers and ensures adequate protection for Investors.Listing on the exchange permits access to global capital and further facilitates attracting the right capital given a company’s stage of growth and future vision. Q: The interest rates at present are low, hence why would you recommend companies to come and raise capital for their next phase of growth?A: Interest rates are low for both borrowers and savers. This actually provides a prime opportunity for companies to list as the valuations that they may be able to solicit will be more attractive. Investors (aka savers) are hungry for higher yields and they will not find those savings rates at our banks or via new debt instruments. Therefore, they will be willing to pay a higher price for IPO’s of companies with strong growth stories and/or visions.The government has encouraged long-term investing by providing a tax deduction of Rs. 100,000 per month for investments made in the stock market. This will further fuel the growth of stocks becoming a common component of a savings portfolio – which is actually an important aspect of a diversified retirement savings plan, however not widely used in Sri Lanka. In other words, more demand for quality listings. The government has also accorded tax reductions for companies that list prior to the end of the year, which some Issuers may find attractive.Q: SMEs contribute over 50% of the GDP. How has the CSE come forward to aid SME growth?A: Small and Medium Enterprises are the backbone of economies globally and at the CSE we launched a new Board – The Empower Board – in order to cater to the growth needs of this segment. The Empower board is a platform for smaller and nascent companies to access global capital and enables them to lower their reliance on restrictive bank lending terms. We encourage SMEs to contact us and explore the opportunities that listing will provide them.Q: You mentioned the tax relief provided in relation to activity at the stock market. Do you expect these benefits to be sustainable?A: The concessions provided for new IPOs and those provided to Investors are strong steps to strengthen stakeholder participation. The Sri Lanka stock market in terms of Investor participation and Issuer participation is still nascent and therefore such policies will drive both types to learn about how best to leverage the stock exchange. As participation increases and Investors and Issuers start benefiting due to stronger uptake as a result of these policies, you will find them to be sustainable and effective methods to grow the overall capital market. Q: How does the exchange support issuers interested in listing?A: The Origination and Issuer Relations (O&IR) unit is available for potential issuers to get the opportunity to better understand how best they can leverage the stock market. The O&IR provides potential Issuers a starting point to familiarise themselves with the listing process as well as the advantages of leveraging the exchange for funding needs.The unit at the exchange is available to Issuers at all points through to the submission of the listing application as a sounding board. Following the IPO, the Colombo Stock Exchange will continue to be available and provide support to newly listed entities to better facilitate the transition to a publicly quoted entity.  "

3 May 2020,"New equity fund, an impetus to business - Ajith Nivard Cabraal","The Sri Lankan economy and in particular the enterprises badly hit by the pandemic need a vibrant revival strategy, said Senior Advisor to the Prime Minister and former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal.“I have proposed a Rs. 150 billion (US$ 750 million) ‘Covid Equity Fund’ which will help revive stressed enterprises to be bankable again, banks and finance companies to improve their  liquidity and the economy to regain stability,” he said. Cabraal said the Government and banks could collectively woo in foreign investors and asset management companies to set up the fund which could be managed by a top private sector Board and CEO.The Equity Fund could be used to settle up to 25% of bank debt of enterprises and  receive new shares giving a reasonable ownership stake for investors in the enterprise.Enterprises could sell and exit the Fund within three to five years according to a specified ‘exit’ mechanism enabling it to reposition itself better.He said Covid-19 has resulted in many business enterprises facing liquidity issues and a host of new challenges in addition to the brought forward losses due to past economic mismanagement.“The economic shock may result in collective enterprise collapse leading to massive job losses, serious contraction of the economy, social unrest, liquidity risks and losses to banks and financial institutions and debt default,” Cabraal said, adding that infusing new liquidity to stressed businesses is crucial. Providing new loans with new interest rates to enterprises which still enjoy the same old income levels will not make enterprises viable and bring economic stability to the country. He said if the proposal is implemented it will help relieve the stress on enterprises with new equity, prevent loss of jobs and restore economic stability in the country. In  the first  strategy to revive the economy, Cabraal proposed the return of approximately 20 percent of the balances amounting to around to Rs. 500 billion of the Employees Provident Fund lying to  the credit of members directly to them.He proposed that as an alternative to providing a direct fiscal hand-out, around Rs. 500 billion could be infused into the economy by unconditionally returning around 20% of the EPF Member balances to members, of the total of around Rs. 2,500 billion lying to the credit of the EPF members as at December 31, 2019. "
15 November 2020,IFC and Australian Govt help to create and retain jobs for women in Lanka,"A two-year partnership, known as SheWorks Sri Lanka, has led to a 12 percent increase in the number of women employed by 15 of the country’s leading companies, equating to over 12,000 more women in the workforce.  Initiated by Women in Work, a partnership between IFC (International Finance Corporation), a member of the World Bank Group, and the Australian government, SheWorks Sri Lanka aimed to create more equal and respectful workplaces for women and men in the country’s workforce, while also boosting business productivity and growth.Launched in March 2018, the partnership has seen the SheWorks companies implement 97 gender-smart actions focused on increasing women’s business leadership, ensuring recruitment and retention of female talent, exploring employer-supported childcare, promoting anti-sexual harassment mechanisms, and supporting women in the supply chain.The partnership also led to a one-third increase in the number of women board directors in the SheWorks companies as well as a 21 percent rise in the number of women in leadership roles. Six companies saw an 8 to 60 percent increase in the share of women in middle management. “For growth to be truly inclusive, strengthening opportunities for women in the workforce is a must and the SheWorks companies have shown how advancing workplace equality also improves business outcomes,” said IFC Country Manager for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Amena Arif. “We look forward to seeing other Sri Lankan companies step up and embrace the gender equality agenda in the workplace.”Women’s participation in Sri Lanka’s labour force remains low at 34 percent, less than half that of men. Further, women in the 20-40 age group are the most disadvantaged, securing only 30 percent of jobs in the private sector, reflecting women’s increased care responsibilities that are associated with marriage and childbearing and other entrenched social norms.Against this backdrop, it is essential that companies create an environment where both men and women can thrive at work. “SheWorks has delivered significant ‘gender shifts’ in Sri Lanka’s workforce that have ultimately improved the corporate bottom line. More companies are providing opportunities for women in non-traditional roles and male-dominated sectors, including in corporate leadership,” said David Holly, Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka.“These companies set an example for others to follow in promoting greater gender equality across the country.”Representing over 170,000 employees, the 15 companies spread across Sri Lanka’s priority industries such as garments and apparel, tourism, information technology, banking and finance and conglomerates. SheWorks Sri Lanka members include AIA Insurance Lanka Ltd, Brandix Lanka Ltd, CBL Group, DIMO PLC, Fairway Holdings (Pvt) Limited, Hela Clothing, Hemas Holdings PLC, Jetwing, John Keells Holdings PLC, London Stock Exchange Group, MAS Holdings, National Development Bank PLC, SANASA Development Bank, South Asia Gateway Terminals, and Standard Chartered Bank.An IFC publication ‘Sri Lankan Business Advance Gender Equality’ provides in-depth information on the impact and business results of the SheWorks Sri Lanka partnership — from March 2018 to December 2019. "
12 September 2021,“Australia keen to help agri sector adopt to climate change”,"Over 200 agribusinesses in Sri Lanka are now better informed on the business need for climate change adaptation following a successful webinar, ‘Experience from Industry Leaders,’ organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in partnership with the Australian Government-funded Market Development Facility (MDF).The virtual event was the first in a planned series for local agribusiness titled,‘The Business Case for Climate Change Adaptation for Agribusinesses’. The series raises awareness on climate change implications for Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector and highlights the need for strong private sector focusCharitha Subasinghe,  on adaptation and mitigation to ensure resilience of businesses and investments.The kick-off webinar was attended by close to 200 agribusinesses of varying scale, reflecting growing business interest in how to effectively manage climate change alongside growing profits. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report recently indicating a ‘code red’ alert for humanity. Impacts of climate change like high temperatures, changes in rainfall and extreme weather events like floods and landslides are increasingly felt across Sri Lanka at varying levels, impacting businesses and rural livelihoods.Opening the event, Australian Deputy High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Ms. Amanda Jewell said, “Australia is keen to support Sri Lanka adapt to climate change,and to plan, prepare for and respond to climate change related impacts.”“We hope this event provides a wonderful opportunity for business leaders in the agriculture sector to come together to discuss common objectives to expand climate change mitigation and adaptation to increase profits and advance business models. Particularly, as the world copes with challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, sustainability has become an essential cornerstone for building resilience of our businesses and investments,” she said.The event featured industry veterans such as  CEO of Dilmah, Dilhan Fernando; President, Retail, John Keells Holdings, Charitha Subasinghe; Group Managing Director, CBL Group, Ms. Shea Wickramasingha;  Managing Director, Aitken Spence Plantation Managements, Dr. Rohan Fernando; and Principal Researcher and RGL – Disaster Risk Management and Climate Resilience, International Water Management Institute, Dr. Giriraj Amarnath. The webinar was moderated by  Editor of the Daily FT, Nisthar Cassim, CEO, Dilmah Tea Company, Dilhan Fernando said, “Globally, climate change is expected to reduce crop yields by 10 – 25 per cent by the end of the century.Therefore, we have a very serious issue relating to food security, export economy, and also social instability and could be a result of weakening rural economy.”“Every business is a product of its environment. We see agribusinesses challenged in an unprecedented way.The solutions are there. We have the tools; we have the knowledge in our ancestors which is incredibly important today.We need to learn to collaborate. We need to change from an attitude of confrontation to one of collaboration with nature.Because in collaboration we have incredible potential,” he said."
12 April 2020,  NCE probes into pros and cons of laying off employees ,"Sri Lanka as a small economy, where the economic backbone is made up of micro, small and medium sized enterprises and dependent on export revenue for foreign currency generation is facing a vulnerable situation. The country is enduring a challenging period in terms of healthcare and an economic upheaval. It is obvious that businesses are struggling to maintain the normalcy but to no avail, the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) said in a media release. “Exporters are experiencing dual supply chain shocks, where some cannot receive raw materials and some cannot secure orders from clients due to the lockdown in other countries.  This has resulted in Halt Production, with many businesses reaching a critical junction. Some of the exporters are facing issues with cancelled pre-orders on already manufactured batches of products in terms of the economic slowdown around the world. In this light, many organisations have reported to downsizing the employees to stay afloat.  “However, it should be highlighted with concern that laying off employees at a time like this will have detrimental effects, since redundancy is the last thing one would expect during a calamity.“On a separate note, an organisation may feel that dismissal of certain number of employees would be a short term solution to address the current business turmoil, yet when the world recovers and recuperates, the business venture will need to grow creating a vacuum of experienced and skillful employees.“In such a situation recruitment of new workforce and training will come with its own cost, exponentially increasing the operational cost of the organisation.“While businesses are focusing on scaling down activities to a more realistic and manageable size under the circumstances, they also have a legal as well as a moral obligation towards their long standing employees who have contributed to the success of the organization. Human Capital, the most valuable resource in the organization ensures that business enterprises sustain its activities profitably in the longer term due to high performing and effective workforce.  Hence downscaling such employees may also have a negative impact on the goodwill of the enterprise with a negative public reception and loss of credibility.“Even as the businesses are struggling to keep their head above water, they also have to resort to any alternative methods in sustaining their business than moving towards drastic measures such as pay cuts and layoffs which impact the Human Capital of an organization.   When downsizing is a knee-jerk reaction, it has long-term costs. A best laid HR policy should be in place with the consultation of all other departments of the organization in resolving the issues at hand. “The authorities ought to monitor and control how the concessions are granted in terms of debt moratorium as some corporates may take undue advantage by utilizing the grants given by the government and will not pass the benefit to their employees.“Businesses can adopt best practices by business process re-engineering, involvement of employees in search for ways to reduce costs, waste and inefficiencies, diversification of business into related or non-related areas and encouraging employees to be innovative.“Businesses cannot perform employee redundancy in a haphazard  manner as there are regulations laid by the Labour Department of Sri Lanka to protect labour rights.  Business enterprises must stay apprised of the current legal landscape. “With every region at risk of natural and man-made disasters and supply chains and markets increasingly globally connected, it is becoming ever more important for businesses to develop robust disaster plans to reduce the potential impact. But to work out disaster plans, the starting point is to understand what that impact could be – and how events far from your core operations could hit your business,” the statement added."
18 October 2020,"Polyphenol-based marketing, the turning point for Ceylon Tea","It will become a lost opportunity for the plantation employees if we continue to resort to no action talk only policy. Almost all the plantation issues today pivot around a single most indicator which is the NSA or the net sale averages of individual crops.We are eager to find out who is at fault and not what is at fault. Here is an opportunity for a strategic intervention combined with IT/ICT based system improvements without further delay with the ultimate objective of turning around the plantation industry.Since I suggested polyphenol-based marketing a few years back, the Japanese appear to have developed the machine to determine polyphenol content of made tea, tried, and tested in many tea growing countries, including in Sri Lanka. Polyphenol based demand for tea, therefore is a strong possibility.Continuous developments are taking place with many beverage producers with the help of leading beverage universities in the world. We are yet to initiate action in this direction. A top strategic plan is essential to drive the tea industry forward.An entrepreneurial mindset is the absolute need of the hour as over 75% of the national production of tea comes from the smallholder sector.Growth strategies must take precedence over the regulatory process. It is our candid opinion that State officials manning the industry are more comfortable with regulation and less interested in growth. Leading an ailing industry only through regulation is somewhat comparable with strangulating to death.We are somewhat unfortunate that we don’t appear to be embracing MPH concepts such as meritocracy, pragmatism and honesty like in Singapore, Dubai etc. But such deficiencies should not be hindrances to support an entrepreneurial culture that can help the tea industry to achieve its true potential ( 5 b USD per annum).Dilly-dallyingSadly, many developments are taking place in the industry at a global level whereas, we are dilly-dallying with closing down the tea factories owing to introducing additives and creating mayhem by calling the best part of our tea production as refuse tea.Laws are meaningful if the judges consider the circumstances under which the offences took place. Problems lead to opportunities. Since the industry has more to do and less to celebrate all must strengthen the tea Board and its chairman.Drawing some clues from the incidents of 9/11 in the US and the recent Covid-19 issue in China, our media has a lot to think about before acting on tea industry-related media publicity. Responsible media is an absolute necessity towards achieving national growth targets, but not to provide ammunition to our competitors to destroy us lock stock and barrel.At the bottom of all these issues are the unscientific approaches and corruption to some degree that are obvious. The causal factor that comes loud and clear again is attempting to address the symptoms while purposely avoiding solving the problem. For that, we must blame the entirety of the education system, which is absent of analytical and critical thinking skills further perished with an island mentality. In the end, the planting community and the national economy suffers, primarily due to the loss of jobs at the grassroots level.We must remember that those who are losing jobs are the strong voices of our society who wanted the current President in power with great expectations.Total change will take place if we could condition our minds to start thinking with the end in mind. The spike in this instance is the Per Capita Income goal. Therefore, a strategic intervention aiming at 10 b USD revenue per annum from the plantation industry is essential. Almost half of it is the true potential of the tea industry.Road mapWe need a fully aligned road map to get to the goal fast. It is left to the President to teach his team of leaders the power of strategic management and get everyone to look at one nation-one goal target.Achieving 10,000 USD per capita income before the first term of office is over is a fitting challenge.The Ceylon Planters Society is committed to uplift the industry, and this is another one such intervention with tea. We will also speak of the other crops at the very earliest.There is sufficient research evidence to conclude that tea improves heart health.Tea can potentially enhance the blood flow around the body by widening key arteries and reducing the risk of clots. tea also contains antioxidants called ‘flavonoids’, which may slow down the onset and risk of heart disease.But the million dollar question we Sri Lankans must ask ourselves today is, are we making full use of the organic compounds in tea, to attract new markets and better prices. The magical experience when drinking tea has very little to do with the grades of tea.Though green tea was believed to have more polyphenols, it turns out that black tea too has similar amounts. The most potent polyphenol in tea is a substance called EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), which belongs to a group of flavonoid phytochemicals called catechins.Catechins are polyphenolic compounds found in tea leaves. In recent studies, catechins were found to be providing various health benefits against numerous diseases. Studies have shown that catechins have antiviral effects against diverse viruses as well.The significant portion of our tea remains a commodity. As long as we stay on the commodity market, we will continue to be price takers and not price makers. A strategic intervention is needed, aiming at gaining a higher value for tea through the latest concepts of marketing.The national policy should be only to serve tea at national and international functions and not other competitive beverages. Such nationalistic thinking and acting are yet to emerge.VFMThe worst is that the consumer is not educated on the value for money, like in the case of marketing. Value for money (VFM) is not about achieving the lowest price by disposing of large quantities in one single tea auction.It is about achieving the optimum combination of whole life costs and quality. Traditionally VFM was thought of as getting the right quality, in the right quantity, at the right time, from the right supplier at the right price. Will 10 USD be too much to ask for a kilo of tea, immensely when tea helps you to be healthier? Compare this opportunity with the disease-free happy lifestyle enjoyed by the plantation workers for the past 150 years that stands as living proof for the drinking of tea.Tea is very much a part of the global beverage industry. The industry is a mature sector and includes companies that market non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages that are targeted at several market segments such as infants, adults, and elderly populations.We take the easy path of resistance, thus requiring State intervention, which is more important than getting engaged in plantation workers wage negotiations.The industry will turn around the day government ministers understand their unique role of having to develop and implement policy aiming at improving the socio-economic well-being of Sri Lankans. President Mahinda Rajapaksa achieved a 4,000 USD per capita income goal before his office came to an end by 2015. What we need now is to take it to 10,000 USD per capita levels before 2025, before the current parliament ends its term.WeakSee how the other non-alcoholic beverage competitors are encroaching our beverage market considering our vulnerable position of strategic execution. Planters have assisted ministry officials by providing vital financial performance indicators such as NPV, IRR re all crops cultivated so the ministry could understand how to plan and execute a strategic intervention with definitive timelinesIt is a pathetic site to observe that competitor beverages, without much comparative or competitive advantage, are successfully competing with tea because we have failed to educate our consumers on the relative health benefits of tea.It is about time we understood national priorities rather than strengthening the economies of multinationals and engage in mundane issues such as refuse tea, wages, strikes, climate change that we are comfortable with.The media, while making their margins by playing to the gallery, must make it a point to address possibilities of nation-building topics even occasionally.The issues such as: How to increase medicinal properties in tea, will tea remain beyond 2050, competitive advantages of Sri Lankan tea, do the plantations have measurable soil standards to grow tea sustainably, Why food scientists are absent in tea processing value chain in Sri Lanka. Is Sri Lankan tea strategically managed, why HR concepts are taboo in Plantations Management, Is the practice of purchasing green leaf to factories purely by weight sustainable, the need of increasing profit per hectare of plantation land annually, Are their smart plantations in Sri Lanka are pertinent questions to ask.In short, the media can launch a broader dialogue aiming at most problematic industries such as the plantations. It is essential to align the nation to one single economic goal, and only the media could do it as average leadership is absolutely weak.The pioneers of the tea industry built a great initiative that can be marketed as a beverage without guilt. Tea is a generic product without guilt.The writer is a former senior planter and agricultural advisor"
5 June 2021,Thoughts on a ‘Tech-Tradi’ tribe: timely tapping of talent,"It is sad and shocking to see sickened India battling with a devastating wave of Covid-19. Tamilnadu and many other states have been locked down continuously. It reminded me of my  first visit to Tamilnadu, which was a memorable one.I was one of the speakers at the Annual Conference of the National Institute of Personnel Management (NIPM), India in 2015. I received much warmth from the Coimbatore people.Representing the Institute of Personnel Management (IPM) Sri Lanka, the pioneering opportunity of being a Sri Lankan speaker at an NIPM event was indeed significant, in keeping Sri Lankan flag high. In staying positive amidst a prolonged lockdown, I thought of re-visiting the essence of what I have experienced. OverviewHeadquartered in Kolkata, the National Institute of Personnel Management (NIPM) is a pan-India, think tank of Human Resource managers drawn from diverse fields and industries. As one of the oldest professional bodies operating in this space for the past six decades, NIPM has been hugely successful in driving major policy changes and pushing reforms in Labour Welfare and Industrial Relations both in public and private. Today, NIPM is acknowledged as an industry watchdog for all aspects of HR Development and Human Capital Functioning.  The signature annual conclave of the National Institute of Personnel Management (NIPM), NATCON 2015 was conducted as a memorable event for HR executives looking to expand their knowledge and share their experiences. The theme for 34th NIPM National Conference was  “Winnovate HR for Business and People”. It’s meant to brainstorm industry best practices and benchmark recent ROI-driven approaches and applications to people management that have produced stunning results for businesses, across the globe.   ‘Winnvate’ HR for business and peopleThe coining of the term “winnovation” was quite an interesting one. In the technology-led, competition-intensified, global business economy, CEOs and the HR fraternity know that to survive, their  businesses must change, but aren’t quite sure what people-centric practices still apply and which ones must be retooled to serve new business challenges.The need for long-term focus was pronounced louder in the years following the financial crisis. Yet in the midst of so much change and complexity, even the most progressive companies can struggle to fully engage their employees, customers and business allies in ways that create mutual benefit.They know that in the dynamic business environment, the symbiotic relationship between organizations and people must also shift in profound ways. Economic volatility, the erosion of trust, the desire for sustainable lifestyles and the ability to instantly communicate across social networks have converged to create a new and exciting business environment that must be embraced in order to remain in the business itself.It is widely accepted among business leaders that innovation is vital for competitive advantage and long term success and innovation is one of the three top challenges CEOs face today. The ability to innovate and sustain it for business growth and stability  is the predictor of the  future. Winnovation is every stakeholder’s responsibility because, more than technology, it’s human capital that’s driving change all around us. The most  successful corporate innovation strategies are one that predominantly focus on people and human capital rather than technology playing the important role.Human Resource is perfectly placed to develop and sustain the kind of cultural transformation required for achieving the above objectives, whether it is organisational design or  objective  setting or appraisal process or any other people process. It is developing an approach that is right to the organization’s   unique set of circumstances.Managing diversity in appreciating the diversity of thought and culture, consistently conveying correct signals about new approaches to every employee, reinforcing the importance of innovative practices and encouraging employees to share and develop ideas and also to understand unique skills, competence and behaviour to succeed in the mission.Last but pertinent that develop leaders to continually scan and adopt a mindset of dissatisfaction with the status quo.Among the sub-themes involved were: Preparedness of HR to synthesize changing  customer  expectations, business dynamics, disruptive technologies & people aspirationsInnovative cultural foundation beyond cost arbitrage. Resultant processes in people identification, attraction, building, buying, borrowing or outsourcingSkill Building for future IndiaRole of HR in digitalized world and impact of social mediaEvolving next generational leaders, reverse mentoring & UnlearningA deep dive into workplace dynamics and the state of  changing work cultureThe Bottom-line emphasis - balancing cost control and value creationDevil’s Advocate, Too much materialism at what costHR Analytics for business transformation.These options will see HR survive and thrive as an indispensable value creator.Evolving next generation leadersI was invited to focus on this broad sub-theme. Upon contemplating, I realised the need to emphasise the similarities and differences of millennials of South Asia and the west. Many have been discussed about millennials in multiple media. Since William Strauss and Neil Howe came up with the Generations Theory in early 1990s with their seminal book, people all over the world started paying attention to the existence of multiple generations in the workplace.Millennials or Generation Y employees who were popularly known as to have been born between 1980 to 1999 (exact period is disputed) have differences in their perceptions, preferences, and performance.  They are much more tech-savvy compared to their generation X predecessors, having been exposed to rapid advancement in information and communication technology during past decades. They are also for more flexible work arrangements. Rigid eight hour work rule will make them bored and unproductive. They are also much more ecological conscious in going green.  These triple aspects of tech-savviness, work flexibility and green-consciousness act as key indicators with regard to their preferences towards work arrangements. Millennials have a “can-do” attitude about tasks at work and look for feedback about how they are doing frequently. Millennials want a variety of tasks and expect that they will accomplish every one of them. Positive and confident, they  are ready to take on the world.They seek leadership, and even structure, from their older and managerial coworkers, but expect that you will draw out and respect their ideas. Millennials seek a challenge and do not want to experience boredom. Used to balancing many activities such as teams, friends, and philanthropic activities, millennials want flexibility in scheduling and a life away from work.Millennials need to see where their career is going and they want to know exactly what they need to do to get there. Millennials await their next challenge – there better be a next challenge. Millennials are the most connected generation in history and will network right out of their current workplace if these needs are not met. Computer experts, millennials are connected all over the world by email, instant messages, text messages, and the Internet.While the classification of generations shed much light into how people of different ages behave differently, it highlighted its own limitations as well. One obvious factor among all these generations is that the very names are associated with events that took place in the West, and to a very high extent in the USA. The degree of relevance and applicability to South Asia is questionable. South Asia as a HR regionOne fifth of the world population is housed in South Asia. Obviously, it is a humanly rich (HR) region. Yet, it is only second to Sub-Saharan Africa with regard to poverty. I see a paradox here. On one hand we have brilliant brains. More than 10 percent of NASA scientists are from South Asia. On the other hand, we have the worst form of poverty. Co-existence of best brains and worst poverty is an interesting phenomenon. In extending the South Asian specialty to millennials, we see some clear differences. Whist the tech-savvy nature is universally consistent, the key difference emerges in the spheres of religion and culture. Recent researches on millennials across the globe have highlighted such differences promptly. Attitude towards marriage, approach towards family, respect towards religions are some key differentiating factors among South Asian millennials. On one side they are ardent fans of technology. On the other side, they are active upholders of tradition. I would coin the term “tech-tradi tribe” to describe such distinct millennials in South Asia.It reminds me what late Prof. Uditha Liyanage spoke of mode-tradi consumer in Sri Lanka.  We see many young Sri Lankans wearing a “pirith nool” and a Levis jean, in show-casing their association with modernity and tradition.In a globalised world, we get influenced, or even dominated by a western thought process, overshadowing the indigenous realities. Multigenerational classification is one such example.  The emerging leaders in South Asia representing the tech-tradi tribe will show the world their distinct difference.  Way forwardThe treasures and travails of the “tech-tradi” tribe  have mentioned need to be further explored. They are already in our workplaces. They want to be lean, seen and green, in going, growing and glowing. The amount of enthusiastic responses I received in Coimbatore is ample proof that the ‘tech-tradi tribe’ is worth exploring further. In continuing to combat Covid-19, the innovative minds of the “tech-tradi” tribe should be timely tapped. We have already seen a glimpse of prototypes of medical devices being developed in assisting Covid-19 treatment. We need fresh thinking and focused actions, more than any other time. "
1 March 2020,Lankan gymnasium chain sets footprint in India,"Chairman of Power World Gymnasium chain, Talavou Alailama has set up a chain of gyms in New Delhi and Bangalore in India and plans to expand in the future.Educated at Trinity College and St. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia, Alailama holds a Masters Degree in Sports Management from a Spanish university and strength training and sports nutrition qualifications from a USA university. He is a South Asian Games medalist and former Sri Lankan record holder in Shot Putt and Discus Throw.In an interview with Sunday Observer Business, Alailama outlines his road to success.Excerpts from the interview:Q. You are known as the father of the gym industry in Sri Lanka. What factors made you set up the first commercial gymnasium?A. In my student days, I spent my holidays in my grandmother’s rubber estate. During this time, I made weight plates with concrete and did exercises such as the bench press, squat and clean and jerk.With that eagerness and passion for the sport, while doing my undergraduate studies in the USA; I got myself admitted to world class gymnasiums for high standard weight training. In a short time, I realised that I was rapidly building my strength.I decided to introduce such a high criterion to Sri Lankans, which was unavailable at the time.In my second year in the University, I decided to start my own gym and name it combining the words ‘power’ and ‘world’.Q. Do you think that this gym culture should be introduced to Sri Lankan society?A. Combined with urban patterns of living, Sri Lankans are increasingly moving towards a sedentary lifestyle. It is amazing how many of those who most need exercise choose to ride the escalator when steps are available.The association between heart disease and other degenerative diseases and a sedentary lifestyle is well known. When such irrefutable evidence confronts us, we need to commit to exercise regularly.We are designed and built for movement, and even though we, as a society, have been adapting a more inactive lifestyle, it appears that people have not adjusted well to the reduced level of activity.Regular exercise is necessary and imperative if we are to maintain an optimal level of health, a high level of physical performance and a well-balanced physical appearance.Q. When you opened your first gym in 1994, we were in the midst of tough economic times. How did you pioneer a new industry as a 24-year-old youngster and succeed?A. From the inception, Power World Gyms were the first world-class gyms in Sri Lanka; large format and well equipped. It had all the equipment to optimise and meet everyone’s fitness and exercise needs.The ability to exercise in an organised and systemic manner to achieve one’s optimum fitness goals at an affordable price, was a huge untapped need in Sri Lanka.When Power World Gyms began to roll-out, thousands began to patronise us. Even after 25 years, it is clear that the gym industry is still expanding, with a larger percentage of young people working out in gyms each year than the year before. Given that the demand for facilities outstripped the availability of gyms, during those early years, even with economic downturn and bomb explosions in and around Colombo at regular intervals, the demand for our gyms never subsided but only increased. This demand kept pushing us to expand our gym network to being the largest network by far from its modest beginnings.Q. In 2015, after 20 years in business, you entered a new arena. Tell us about it.A. Seeing the unique gym model that we had created; resilient to any type of economic downturn and able to overcome challenges and yet be profitable, an Indian stock market company invested in us to not only expand our network in Sri Lanka but also in India. This partnership, took the Power World gyms from being a local market leader to being the market leader in Bangalore, Delhi and Pune within two years.Q. Only a few of Sri Lankan companies have entered the Indian market, but you have established yourself and have become a market leader. How did this take place?A. In the past decade, we have seen scientists and doctors promoting regular exercises, being imperative to a healthy lifestyle. This has built a large untouched demand for facilities such as ours. Gymnasiums in India were those which targeted the upper end of the market and were poorly equipped and small format for the lower segments. We assessed the gym market correctly, and built large format and well equipped gyms to provide the best service to customers. We offered an affordable price to the middle-income groups in India. The irony is that we are currently much larger in India than Sri Lanka.Q. Many of our readers may want to know how they too could enter the Indian market and take advantage of its size. What is your advice to them?A. India has a gigantic market as everyone knows. When searching for a partnership with an India company, I suggest that you secure the services of a Mergers and Acquisition expert from India to negotiate on your behalf. An advisor will also help you find the right match, a partner who is more likely to share your vision and mission for the business and buy into the values you wish to uphold.At the outset, the Indian investors, are extremely aggressive in their negotiation style, and only a very few of us would match that level of negotiating skills. Having one from India to negotiate on your behalf is a worthwhile investment. Second, we must have a clear scheme for the partnership.One should not give up ownership or control of the business at any cost. The Indian investor’s nature is to negotiate hard and get the maximum they can, and will push you even beyond what you are willing to let go. If you hold ground, in the place where you are the happiest, the deal will take place even though many a times prior to that it would seem as if the deal would not work out.Q. What is the next goal for your business and your CSR initiatives?A. Our goal in the next two years is to be the leader in the Indian gym industry, with the largest chain of gyms and also enter 15 other countries in Asia and Africa. We plan to expand our Sri Lankan operation by setting up 150 state-of-the-art gymnasiums. We also have been engaged in many CSR projects. Power World Gyms have set up gyms for inmates of Welikade, Mahara and Bogambara prisons and plan to donate gyms to all prisons within the next two years. We were also actively engaged in many dengue prevention programs during the past few years. We plan to continue these projects. "
22 November 2020,2021 Budget: Evenly poised,"The 2021 Budget was hailed by economists, industry experts and the business community as an evenly poised budget but not without challenges as global uncertainty is expected to dampen economic prospects for a good part of 2021. However, cautious optimism was expressed from many quarters due to the potential the country has to achieve higher economic growth which is being supported by a budget which focuses on promoting manufacturing, export competitiveness and harnessing foreign investments for productive ventures to achieve the envisaged target of six and above economic growth rate in the years ahead.The 2021 Budget is also considered a people-friendly budget providing tax relief across a wide spectrum of sectors and supporting the revival of Covid-19 affected SME businesses and the revitalisation of the rural economy.The measures such as extending the period for repayment of refinancing loan facilities the tourism sector up to September 30 2021, increasing the daily wage of estate workers to Rs.1,000 from January next year, an insurance scheme for Covid-19 affected employees, amending the Employees’ Provident Fund Act to expand the retirement age for men and women up to 60, building 50,000 houses providing a 25-year loan with an interest rate of 6.25% granted for applicants of these state housing projects, migrant workers to be given Rs. 2 for every dollar remitted to boost foreign remittances, a contributory pension for migrant workers, annual intake of technical colleges to be increased to 200,000 per year, a five-year tax relief for private educational institutions, a new loan scheme for Samurdhi beneficiaries on 7% interest and Rs. 18,000 million additional provisions to combat Covid-19 are aimed at incentivising and creating a vibrant domestic economy that has been over-reliant of foreign aid and a few conventional export items which has stifled economic growth for decades.However, the herculean task as expressed by think tanks and economists is that how would the government carry out development initiatives when the annual foreign debt servicing amounts to over USD 4,000 million in the next four years.The country cannot as opined by experts cannot raise money from international markets as its sovereign rating has been downgraded and the debt to revenue approaching 100 percent.Will ensure sustainable growthState Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms, :Ajith Nivard Cabraal:The government will stick to the overall objective of achieving prosperity in the country by ensuring steady and sustainable growth in the years to come with a focus on achieving over six percent growth through investments, public sector reforms, export competitiveness, capital market reforms and a vibrant manufacturing sector.We first need to help the economy to recover first as helping a patient to recover and then take measures to sustain growth. The government has provided the stage for a steady economic through the incentives and concessions in the budget but it cannot achieve everything alone.The role of the private sector is key to drive growth through investments.Public sector collaboration will also be paramount in this regard and for that key reforms will be effected from 2021.Govt has taken a calculated riskFormer Central Bank Deputy Governor : Dr. W.A. Wijewardena:State Minister Ajith Nivard Cabraal at a recent Webinar on Budget 2021 said that it is an ‘evenly-poised budget’ meaning that all parties with diverse interests have been carefully balanced. I am inclined to agree with him.The Budget has been presented at a time when Sri Lanka is going through the most difficult period in its history: on one side, the economy had been ailing since around 2013 and on the other side, that sick man has been completely crippled by the unexpected external shock of Covid-19 pandemic.Hence, the mere fact of coming up with a budget is an achievement.However, the success of the implementation of the promises will crucially depend on two projections made. One is the planned growth target of 6% after 2021 and the other is the increase in government revenue under the new low tax regime if the growth targets are realised.These would be medium term attainments and hence in the short run, the budget suffers from the deficiency of running short of the needed resources.This is a calculated risk which the government has taken and it will be able to mitigate it only if it could implement a proper economic management system in the country.Hence, a lot of ifs have to be realised for the budget to become a success.Works on assumption of 5% growthInstitute of Policy Studies, Executive Director : Dr. Dushni Weerakoon:Budget 2021 has been arrived at under an exceptional level of uncertainty. The course of the Covid-19 pandemic may mean that certain public health measures will prevail for the next year. Even after these measures are withdrawn, it is unrealistic to assume that fiscal policy will revert to its pre-crisis setting, owing to different spending priorities and a slow-burn scenario for revenue generation. Underpinning the trajectory for fiscal ratios is the all-important underlying assumptions on growth recovery. Sri Lanka’s Budget 2021 works on the assumption of 5% growth in 2021, but the balance of risks to the country’s economic and fiscal outlook is tilted to the downside.Domestic financing of an expanded deficit is set at a heavy 8.3% which can trigger a reversal of the current low interest rate regime, adding to interest costs and squeezing GDP growth.However, with a high public investment target of over 6% of GDP, the government has retained sufficient flexibility to adjust numbers should downside risks dominate.CSE welcomes capital market proposalsColombo Stock Exchange Chairman: Dumith Fernando:The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) welcomes the progressive capital market related proposals presented in the 2021 Budget Proposals.Long-term sustainable measures have been proposed to encourage companies to list on the CSE, encourage savings and investments among Sri Lankan citizens and improve the attractiveness of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) through tax concessions. As a measure of promoting new listings on CSE a 50% tax concession for the years 2021/2022 has been proposed to be granted for companies listing on the CSE before December 31, 2021 and to maintain a corporate tax rate of 14 percent for the subsequent three years upon listing.Stock market investment will continue to be exempted from Capital Gains Tax and as an additional measure to encourage stock market investment, the Government has proposed to include investments made in shares of listed companies incurred up to Rs.100,000 per month as deductible expenditures in the calculation of personal income tax.In a measure that would largely improve the attractiveness of REITs investment, the government has proposed to exempt such investments from capital gains tax and dividends free from income tax. The proposal further seeks to reduce the Stamp Duty applicable to real estate transactions associated with REITs to 0.75 percent (from the currently applicable 4% for property transactions).The CSE, working with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka, introduced REITs as a new investment product on the CSE earlier this year.Success lies in implementing proposalsSenior Tax Consultant and Senior Partner Gajma and Company,: N.R. Gajendran:The success of any budget lies in the implementation of its proposals and achieving targets. “Any government through the Budget makes certain assumptions which can go right or wrong based on the external conditions,” he said. According to Verite Research its only around 42 percent of the budget proposals of the 2019 Budget had been implemented.Success lies in implementing proposals...However, according to Gajendran many will be exempted from the VAT threshold which has been increased from Rs. 12 million to Rs. 300 million and the increase of the tax-free allowance from Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 3 million.The SMEs fall into the category of an annual turnover of less than Rs. 500 million.Tax experts said prices of goods are yet to come down even though the VAT rate had been reduced from 15 to 8 percent.The Government targets Rs. 1 trillion in public investment next year which it hopes to raise from the domestic non-bank market.The move is good in one way as it will prevent borrowing at higher interest rates from international markets. It could cause stress to the local market if the business environment does not improve.However, according to Gajendran many will be exempted from the VAT threshold which has been increased from Rs. 12 million to Rs. 300 million and the increase of the tax-free allowance from Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 3 million.The SMEs fall into the category of an annual turnover of less than Rs. 500 million.Tax experts said prices of goods are yet to come down even though the VAT rate had been reduced from 15 to 8 percent. The Government targets Rs. 1 trillion in public investment next year which it hopes to raise from the domestic non-bank market.The move is good in one way as it will prevent borrowing at higher interest rates from international markets.It could cause stress to the local market if the business environment does not improve.VAT reduction will benefit trading communityFormer Assistant Commissioner, Department of Inland Revenue, : A. A. Thilakarathne:A prominent feature of the Budget proposals is the reduction of the VAT rate from 15 to 8 percent. The VAT threshold has been increased to Rs. 300 million per annum from 12 million.The Nation Building Tax (NBT) which was charged at two percent was abolished from 1/1/ 2019 and VAT rate was reduced to eight percent. The benefit of the reduction of these two taxes should go to the end-consumer.Due to the reduction of the taxes, and increase of the VAT threshold, a considerable amount of traders will be exempted since they are below the threshold. Empirical evidence shows that when the VAT and NBT threshold was 12 million per annum, traders were artificially manipulating the threshold not to reach the VAT threshold. As a result, the government was deprived of the VAT and NBT income and as well as the income from income tax.Therefore, the trading community will benefit and they can show their real turnover and pay their due taxes. Since the VAT is an indirect tax, the burden is passed on to the end-consumer. The prices of many consumer items should go down.If it does not, it is up to authorities to look into the matter.The personal income tax threshold has gone up and as a result, a large number of public and private sector employees will be exempted from paying income tax.The PAYE scheme has been done away with. But it should be noted that individuals who receive Rs. 250,000 per month (remuneration, interest) are allowed to pay the due taxes through their employer on a written request.Under tax relief measures to facilitate post Covid-19, several tax relief measures have been granted to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME). Waiver of income tax in arrears payable by the SMEs is proposed on the assessments issued up to the year of assessment 2018/2019 by the CGIR, where he is satisfied that there is no fraud involved. This step is commendable in disposing the huge arrears of tax in default of the Department of Inland Revenue.A grace period has been granted for the taxpayers to settle their taxes having come to an agreement with the Legacy branch of the Department of Inland Revenue. Tourism sector welcomes financial reliefSocial scientist and tourism promoter, : Dr. Dietmar Doering:The Budget proposal on the extension of Repayment of Refinancing Loan facilities until September 30, 2021 is welcomed by the tourism sector as some kind of a relief, though borrowings one day have to be settled with the banks and are subjected to accumulated interest however.The Head of State in his inaugural speech stated the need to focus on developing tourism based on innovative and new aspects, with an emphasis on sports and health tourism. And to develop new types of tourism venues which explicitly could attract foreign high end clientele.These suitable aspirations for the betterment of Sri Lanka Tourism falls directly under the responsibility of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority being the competent authority for tourism Development in Sri Lanka.Nautical Tourism could be one avenue for Sri Lanka with it’s 1.200 km pristine coastal lines.Attracting foreign luxury yacht owners as the would be target requires Yacht harbours, tailor-made for these affluent clients which are commonly known as Marina’s.A panel of experts from shipbuilders to dockyard operators and even Navy representatives in numerous letters approached the SLTDA to consider the developing of nautical tourism as a new segment for Sri Lanka’s tourism, but so far the appeal has fallen on deaf ears. Request letters had not been answered and invitations for presentations had been ignored by the SLTDA.Encourages entrepreneurship for womenWomen’s Chamber Chief: Mrs. Indrani Fernando:The Women’s Chamber congratulates the Government for presenting a budget which has focused significantly on improving the local businesses, education and skill development and promoting environment-friendly business practices. “We are happy to note that some of our suggestions too have been considered by the government”We applaud the government on its proposals to encourage entrepreneurship including the focus on women under the Samurdhi scheme and young men and women who have completed vocational training. This appears a well thought of scheme which includes setting us a process and preferential financing schemes.We see the initiative to encourage entrepreneurship for 25,000 women chosen from Samudhri families as an initiative that will contribute to them moving from being ‘dependent on the state’ to ‘contributors to the economy’. We are also encouraged to note that these network of shops will function under government sponsorship with a Rs. 1,000 million as government contribution to provide credit facilities and that priority will be given to sell local products.We hope this initiative will benefit many courageous females who have micro-cottage industries to grow and scale their businesses. One of the focus areas of WCIC is to build the capacity of women in the micro sector to grow and scale and obtain financing for progress.We commend the proposal to encourage individuals who have completed vocational education to become entrepreneurs. We believe that this will be an initiative that will assist the country to develop high skilled entrepreneurs who can build successful businesses.We are also encouraged by the initiatives to support villages engaged in traditional industries to expand their production and to facilitate access to markets.There is definitely an abundance of high skilled traditional crafts that we should preserve and promote and brand as Sri Lankan products thereby also increasing the Sri Lankan Brand.We also believe that the proposal to allocate Rs 1,500 mn to purchase raw material for Thriposha will also encourage the SME sector to increase its focus on agriculture while also ensuring we provide the much required Thriposha to pregnant mothers and infants.The measures to promote Small and Medium Scale exports (TIEP scheme) backed by a contributor insurance scheme to assist in working capital requirements to export high quality goods through high value addition to local inputs will also certainly assist the SME exporters.Achieving targets, an uphill taskEconomic analysts:Economic analysts said that the 2021 Budget is the most challenging budget in Sri Lankan history and achieving the targets of the budget will be an uphill task. They said that Covid-19 pandemic has halted most of the economic activities and it was pointed out as the main obstacle the government has faced. All sectors of the economy are performing slower than its potential and lockdowns, curfew and other pandemic prevention measures have crippled economic activities. The second wave started in the industrial sector severely affecting main industrial zones and it is still not under control. Nobody can forecast how this crisis will end and therefore the budget forecast too is vague, they said.The Government expects a 5.5 economic growth in the next year and this is far from the reality projected by the governmnet. According to the IMF the Asian economy will contract -2.2% in 2020 while the Central Bank predicts -1.7% contraction of Sri Lankan economy in the same year and expects recovery from mid-2020. Economic analysts say that now we are at the end of 2020 and the second wave of Covid-19 is still serious and there is no sign of recovery.The Prime Minister said the Government’s medium-term vision is to reduce the budget gap by increasing the economic growth up to 6 percent and increasing government revenue from 9.7 percent to 14.1 percent. However, analysts said that government’s revenue targets are also unrealistic, because of slow economic activities and import restrictions.The outlook of the external sector, which is largely driven by the trade deficit, will depend on the global economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the domestic policy responses. Expatriate workers too have been affected by the pandemic and there will be a drop in foreign remittances.Government expects its import restriction policy will boost domestic production and ease the pressure on the external sector of the economy on a sustained basis. Lot of incentives have been offered by the budget to attract foreign remittance and black money into the economy.Opposition political parties alleged that the budget is totally aimed at borrowing. National People’s Power (NPP) MP Vijitha Herath said “The Government intends borrowing Rs. 3,000 billion (Rs. 3 trillion) in 2021. It had borrowed Rs. 2,000 billion (Rs. 2 trillion) in 2020. Sri Lanka’s total debt services are Rs 13.2 trillion.With the borrowings of 2020 and 2021, it will be increased to Rs 17. 2 trillion. The burden is on the people. This is what the budget 2021 is all about, he said."

7 February 2021,Expolanka records Rs. 4.5 b PAT in Q3,"An agile business model was the cornerstone to Expolanka Holdings PLC sustaining a growth momentum during the latest quarter which ended December 31, 2020. The company attributed its performance to staying on the path of a focused and consistent growth strategy while remaining flexible and optimising opportunities in a dynamic operating environment. The quarter’s performance has resulted in the group generating a Revenue of Rs. 143.2 bn and a Profit After Tax of Rs. 10.8 bn for the first nine months ending December 31, 2020.During the quarter under review, the group recorded a revenue of Rs. 57.8 bn (a 108% increase YoY) with a Gross Profit of Rs. 9.7 bn and a Profit After Tax of Rs. 4.5 bn. The quarter’s growth was driven by the core Logistics business, which recorded a strong performance due to the company’s steadfast pursuit of a long-term strategy to expand the customer profile, diversify service offering, strengthen origin performance, consolidate the procurement function and continue investing in technology.The sector maintained a steady sales volume due to the gradual return of base business, complemented by the supply of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Market rates, origin efficiencies and procurement practices improved yield and a unified collaborative effort led to the logistics sector delivering revenue of Rs. 57.3 bn, Gross Profit of Rs. 9.5 Bn and a Profit After Tax of Rs. 4.7 bn for the quarter.The strong revenue was buoyed by elevated freight rates in the air freight market - to optimise this disruptive environment, EFL used its proactive procurement strategies to leverage long-term carrier partnerships which enabled the company to secure healthy profitability during the quarter.Key markets were positive, in particular the Far East market which performed exceptionally during the quarter while operations in the Indian sub-continent remained robust. The North America trade lane remained the largest contributor of business while the European trade lane showed resilience and Intra Asia trade lane remained measured during the quarter under review.

The technology servicing arm expanded its customer portfolio and market presence and performed commendably. "
27 September 2020,US will continue to empower mid-sized Lankan businesses – US Ambassador,"The United States will constantly seek new opportunities for US businesses to partner and support small and medium sized enterprises and empower women entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka’s journey towards achieving economic prosperity, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Alaina B. Teplitz told guests at the launch of Sri [email protected], a private sector-led initiative focused on the growth of mid-market enterprises last week.She said the US believes in inclusive economic growth which is key to achieve shared prosperity.“Through the US Government’s international development agency, USAID, the US government has set up dynamic and mutually beneficial partnerships with Sri Lanka which will help Sri Lankan businesses,” Teplitz said.She said that US companies have invested over $300 million in Sri Lanka over the past several decades, and expressed hope that this platform would generate more opportunities for mutually beneficial trade and investment between the two countries.“The Sri [email protected] initiative will strengthen mid-sized business enterprises in Sri Lanka.“The initiative demonstrates the US’s commitment to economic development targeting that space.“Such initiatives will power Sri Lanka going forward and will be key to building the economy which has much potential,” the Ambassador said, adding that the move will help increase productivity, access to finance and strengthen the capacity of Sri Lankan institutions.She said as an Ambassador, strengthening private sector capacity is a top priority to create economic opportunities.“You, the entrepreneurs, the business and government leaders expanding the impact and profitability of medium-sized businesses – are the engines that will power Sri Lanka’s prosperity, and the United States is investing in your drive and potential,” said Ambassador Teplitz.She said the USD 26 million funding initiative of the USA provides technical assistance for over 60 mid-sized businesses, increases household income and develops the skills of entrepreneurs,” the ambassador said.The Sri [email protected] initiative is funded by USAID and administered by Stax.U.S. assistance to Sri Lanka has totaled over $2 billion since Sri Lanka’s Independence in 1948.The United States has made substantial investments in agriculture, enterprise development, education, healthcare, energy and natural resources, and humanitarian activities. The purpose of the initiative is to enable Sri Lanka to become a high-income country within 100 years of Independence (by 2048) — with equitable and inclusive growth fueled by the value creation of mid-market firms. The Platform will, in particular, support businesses in underserved segments.Stax Managing Director and Co-Founder of [email protected], Dr. Kumudu Gunasekara said, “While we may have been born in a developing country, we don’t have to continue to live in one.We are incredibly resilient as a people, as a nation.Our SME owners and entrepreneurs have weathered many storms to stay afloat.“This Platform is about helping them to now really power full steam ahead with ambitious growth plans, and about taking Sri Lanka’s development to the next level,” he said.State Minister for Regional Cooperation, Tharaka Balasuriya, too expressed similar sentiments on the importance of supporting medium-scale businesses that have the power to recharge Sri Lanka’s economy.“Programs such as Sri [email protected] help businesses fulfill their potential in an increasingly competitive environment, and will play a large part in the economy’s post-Covid recovery,” he said.Mid-sized firms in Sri Lanka face many challenges when preparing for the next stage of growth — such as dependency on a small domestic market for revenue, limited access to quality business development services, and lack of access to varied forms of capital.The [email protected] Platform is designed to help mid-market companies address such issues by providing high-calibre advisory services in areas such as strategy, marketing, accounting and finance, legal, and technology and data services.The [email protected] Platform is building an ecosystem of trusted vendors and partners who can provide such services and also bring innovative ideas to the table to help mid-market firms grow.The ecosystem will include general business interest organisations such as industry bodies, banks, chambers, state-affiliated organisations, and training and professional skill building institutions."
22 August 2021,Employee motivation during a business crisis,"It’s no secret that employees are going through a very tough time due to the Covid-19 Delta variant outbreak — they need support from leadership clearly more than ever. A motivational speech or a company-wide email are not going to cut it when business and life as we know have been turned completely on its head. Uncertainty is at its highest level and so is the risk.In these challenging times, companies need to be resilient and agile while dealing with crises and understand the impact on their business. Due to this pandemic, we have been forced to go all digital which is one of the biggest organisational challenges. Though there are a plethora of virtual tools available for collaboration while working from home, it is imperative to ensure ‘people connect’ remain strong to create a positive and stress-free work environment. For this, leaders need to show empathy, provide structure, and delve into the current work-life challenges of the teams and colleagues. Employees need direction more than ever before. Leaders should provide clear directions, set the right expectations and in turn, employees need to show reliability and credibility to deliver the expected results safely.Work from home has become relatively easier as managers and team leaders have become more trusting of the teams to finish a given task. With more than one and a half years of experience in the new normal world. Even employees have become more proactive when it comes to taking ownership. This shift in the workplace has encouraged employees to come up with innovative solutions to their own problems. Employees need oxygen Oxygen scarcity, government hospitals running out of capacity, hotels hired by the private hospitals have reached full capacity and weary health workers, are issues that have very little answers.Amid this scary environment, one of the many challenges for business owners during the Delta variant of the Corona virus is maintaining a positive mindset and culture within the workplace.There are so many changes that have been put in place to reduce social interactions, protect yourself from exposure to the virus, and change the way we work within a business. There are also increasingly dire forecasts on not only the numbers of those impacted by Covid-19 but also on the short and long-term impact on the overall business.  In these trying times, finding ways to maintain a positive mental outlook is difficult for business leaders. It is even more difficult to be able to create ways to boost the morale and mindset of teams and employees, particularly if they are concerned about their employment, health, and overall well-being.Create proactive, effective protocols that help employees and team members feel safe and in control of their work environment using the guidelines of the health authorities. Make sure PPE (personal protective equipment) is available and is reasonable for the job.Be sure to highlight to employees how cleaning and disinfecting is managed on the job. Providing resources for employees to learn about Coronavirus without all the hype of the media is also calming and positive.It is easy for everyone to focus on what they cannot do or how business may be dropping off. Having a plan in place to carry through these times makes it clear to your teams and employees that you see a light at the end of the tunnel.By focusing on what you can do, there is a natural positivity and forward movement rather than feeling stuck in an uncontrolled and unplanned scenario. Flexible work environmentAt these times of school closures, lack of daycare services and even challenges in getting groceries and supplies, offering greater flexibility with working hours or remote working is a positive choice. Employees appreciate this flexibility, and they feel supported and cared about as individuals. Leaders can also focus on modeling social distancing, maintaining a positive outlook, and recognising the efforts of the team in navigating difficult times. Showing compassion, supporting local charities and organisations, and even getting involved in community programs to help others are all great ways to stay focused on the positives.  While most leaders think they are communicating, there’s a good chance they aren’t doing so with enough frequency and transparency. Leaders must define and communicate way forward — long-term and in times of crisis — ensuring that the mission is infused into the daily work of every single individual. Although profit and financial strength are a key component of a company’s vision, both the leader and the employees must understand how their work is oriented toward making a difference for others and society.Employees ought to be treated as partners in the company. Don’t wait for a scheduled quarterly meeting to let employees know what’s happening. For example, regularly send out videos with company updates that are honest and transparent.It’s a nice way to update employees and remove the guesswork, anxiety and rumours. Be consistent with your message and update everyone when situations change. This allows employees to remain focused on their jobs and understand their role in the current state of affairs.  People do extraordinary work and demonstrate astonishing commitment and kindness during crises. Make sure to encourage people to recognise each other in whatever ways are available.Management should take extra steps to recognise and, if appropriate, reward employees for going the extra mile to help colleagues and customers.When managers prioritise employee appreciation and show gratitude for what workers are going through in and out of the workplace, it can make a meaningful difference in creating a healthier and happier remote workforce.A heartfelt message to your employees, the heroes you depend on every day, can go a long way. Remember, how you handle these troubling times will define your business for many years to come."

2 May 2021,"Collaborative approach, critical for apparel sector recovery - Experts","Experts at CPD-IPS-SV international webinar on the ‘Recovery of the Apparel Sectors of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka: Is a Value-chain Based Solution Possible?’ call for suppliers, buyers, governments and international organisations to work closely together for speedy and sustainable recovery of the apparel sectors from the Covid-19 shock.  The Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), Bangladesh and the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka (IPS), in partnership with Southern Voice, hosted a webinar recently focusing on solutions to the challenges that the Covid-19 pandemic has created in apparel supplying countries, in particular Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Researchers from CPD and IPS presented their findings and recommendations of a study which explores a value-chain-based solution for Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, where major market players will implement responsible business practices to support a sustainable recovery of both countries’ apparel sectors.This webinar presented an opportunity for key global apparel value chain stakeholders, particularly those based in Europe, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to provide insights into how to implement solutions for the recovery of the apparel sector. The medium-term recovery of the global apparel value chain from the disruptions of the pandemic has been set back by the prolonged demand slump. Global imports of apparels during the period of Jan-Aug 2020 have contracted by 23 percent compared to the same period in 2019. Sri Lanka’s apparel exports fell by 27.6 percent in 2020 and Bangladesh’s apparel export fell by 17 percent in 2020.Initiatives of major brands and buyers were limited to inventory smoothing, reshoring, and over-concentration of orders to a limited number of sources.The recovery of many supplying countries has been slow, including that of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Innovative ‘value-chain-based solutions’ where all stakeholders work collaboratively are required to help all the market players cope with the crisis, ensure rebound and smooth recovery, and ultimately make the value chain resilient.CPD Executive Director Dr. Fahmida Khatun said that CPD and IPS have recently conducted a joint study in partnership with the Southern Voice to analyse the potential of a value-chain-based solution to support the recovery of the local apparel sectors because of the ongoing pandemic.She said that the pandemic has severely disrupted the global apparel value chain and the study proposes solutions to the challenges that have emerged for the apparel-supplying countries particularly in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.Dr. Khatun said that the medium-term recovery measures implemented by market players were not impactful across the value chain and that new solutions which take into account the entire value chain are needed for the industry to recover from the Covid-19 induced crisis.The CPD-IPS study on the ‘Recovery of the Apparel Sector of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka: Is a Value-chain Based Solution Possible?’ has adopted a whole value-chain approach taking into account all challenges facing the apparel sectors.Research Director, CPD Dr. Khondaker Golam Moazzem, emphasised the importance of implementing a value-based solution for the recovery of the apparel sectors, where brands, buyers, governments and international organisations work collaboratively for the sector’s recovery.He emphasised the need for a solution from a value-chain point of view, and called for a re-distribution of ordersamong supplying countries so that countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka canreturn to pre-COVID levels.If this pandemic is prolonged – which increasingly looks to be the case – the demand slump will continue affecting many more buyers and suppliers as well. Governments have been tied by fiscal constraints but what has been done so far is inadequate and short-term in nature.Thus, an innovative approach which takes into account the whole supply chain is needed for medium-term recovery, he said.IPS Research Economist Kithmina Hewage said “Companies that had taken certain measures to improve their resilience such as purchasing stocks well in advance and diversifying their export markets were able to mitigate the effects much better than companies that did not. National-level policies were limited by fiscal constraints and this affected the apparel sector. In comparison to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh had a wider basket of policy tools to support the industry and was able to give more fiscal stimulus to the economy whereas Sri Lanka tended to rely more on monetary policy,” Hewage said.Founder and CEO, Bangladesh Apparel Exchange, Mostafiz Uddin said that that there is a lack of responsible business practices among the brands during the ongoing crisis and that there is a lack of support from buyers. He opined that many do not consider manufacturers as partners, and that brands should consider their suppliers as business partners and act responsibly.Sharing insights from her store which houses over 60 local clothing and accessory brands, Binu Wickramasinghe outlined the difficulties faced by small and medium-scale retailers, and explained that challenges in sourcing raw materials have led to a slowdown in catering to market demand because of the import restrictions on raw materials.Restricting everything is not helpful. It is important to maintain a balance, and take into account the struggles of smaller businesses as they have to put up with a bigger struggle to survive during a crisis, she said.“As a small enterprise, it was difficult for us to obtain a loan from the Government. Our retail is a niche designer-oriented business.  The pandemic hampered our usual cycle so we had to get into online retailing but our e-commerce did not have the kind of merchandise our customers needed so we had to diversify into other categories like loungewear and skincare which were still in demand.However, the transition was not smooth and the second wave was crucial for us as customers got scared and stopped spending,” she said.Head of Sustainability, Global Production, H&M Group Pierre Börjesson said that the pandemic had shown the importance of accelerating digitalisation in doing business. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka should consider how the market could be made more agile and flexible in terms of product diversification, services connected to the products and addressing the sustainability to achieving the possibility of trading higher than in the past.The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities in the apparel industry and has shown the importance of digitalisation.Director of Better Work, ILO Geneva, Dan Rees said that sector-specific measures may not address challenges, and said that to build strong resilience and protect the workers, trust, and cooperation among the stakeholders and a long-term plan is needed."
3 March 2021,Launching the Asian Journal of Management Studies,"The Faculty of Management Studies (FMS) of the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka recently launched the Faculty Journal named Asian Journal of Management Studies (AJMS). As an ""A"" graded faculty in the Sri Lankan state university system, FMS always attempts to be a knowledge hub for the nation by connecting to a broader network. AJMS, a double-blind peer-reviewed scholarly journal in business and management, reflects the FMS’s attempt to benchmark the faculty's contribution to the growth of the body of knowledge in business and management. AJMS aims to promote and provide convenient access to publish and disseminate research works in business and management in the local, regional and global arena.The ceremonial launch was held at the Auditorium of the Staff Development Center, the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka, where Professor Udaya Rathnayake, Vice-Chancellor, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka, attended as the Chief Guest. Prof. Saman K. Herath (Dean, Faculty of Animal Science and Export Agriculture, Uva Wellassa University of Sri Lanka) and Mr. Manil Jayesinghe (President, The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka) attended the ceremony as the Keynote Speaker and Guest of Honour. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the physical gathering was limited to very few dignitaries, including the Heads of the Departments of FMS. Academic, non-academic, and administrative staff members and the students joined the session via online platforms, including Zoom and Facebook Live.Sharing his thoughts at the launch, Professor Udaya Rathnayake stated that “It is indeed a great pleasure to see that the Faculty of Management Studies has taken a step forward by launching the faculty journal”. By appreciating the effort made by FMS in launching this journal, the Vice-Chancellor further stated that “The importance of journals in academic life goes beyond providing a means of communication and a permanent record. Journal articles are the final output of most research, and a researcher's performance and productivity are judged largely on the number of publications as well as where they appear.”The editorial team of AJMS comprises an eminent panel of academics representing the Faculty of Management Studies, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. Professor MSM Aslam (Dean – Faculty of Management Studies) heads the journal as the Editor-in-Chief. Dr. Thilini Chathurika Gamage (Senior Lecturer) and Dr. HP Rasika Priyankara (Senior Lecturer) act as the Managing Editors of the journal. The inaugural issue of the journal consists of six articles and a book review by eminent scholars in Sri Lanka.Commenting on the launching of the journal, Prof. MSM Aslam, Editor-in-Chief/ AJMS and President/ Research and Publication Unit of FMS, stated that “As journals are inevitable scientific communication channel for academic and research institutions, AJMS aims to provide a platform to publish new, high-quality and original research papers in the Management discipline in local, Asian, and global contexts. Although the initial concept of AJMS is a couple of years old, I am glad that as a faculty, we could launch the journal parallel to the 25th Anniversary celebration of the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka.”Addressing the gathering, Dean of the Faculty of Management Studies Prof. Athula Gnanapala stated that “As an academic institution, we believe that it is our primary responsibility to work towards the betterment of the society through new initiatives such as journals and magazines to disseminate the new knowledge.” He also appreciates the effort rendered by the editorial team of the journal in making the journal a success.Sharing his views about the journal, Mr. Manil Jayesinghe (President, The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka) stated that “It is a great initiative taken by the Faculty of Management Studies in providing a platform to the development of economy where the community can learn from others’ experiences and generate new knowledge.” He further necessitated the importance of close cooperation between academic institutions and the private sector in commercializing the research outputs.Prof. Saman K. Herath (Dean, Faculty of Animal Science and Export Agriculture, Uva Wellassa University of Sri Lanka) stated that academic journals enhance the global visibility of the state universities and provide a platform for knowledge dissemination. Most importantly, he has highlighted the importance of research ethics in scientific communication. He emphasized that “Given the competitive nature of research, it has become increasingly challenging for scientists to report unique and pioneering research. Nevertheless, the practice of misreporting data and scientific results continues to be followed by some members of the research community.”Delivering the vote of thanks, Managing Editor of the journal, Dr. Thilini Chathurika Gamage, expressed her sincere gratitude to the distinguished dignitaries who have graced the ceremonial occasion and share their invaluable thoughts despite the busy schedules. Further, she delivered her heartfelt obligations to the editorial team, eminent reviewers, and authors who have contributed immensely to the journal's success.The journal's future issues will focus on contemporary issues in management while providing some solutions and recommendations to overcome such issues.The journal can be easily accessed through https://www.sab.ac.lk/ajms/ "
4 July 2021,Significance of customer perception,"In simple terms, customer perception is the opinion of the customers of an organisation on its business, product, or brand. The term summarises how a customer feels about products based on the direct or indirect experience they have had with the company. Therefore, customer perception is one of the major elements in business success. The term ‘perception’ is defined as the ability to see, hear or become aware of through the senses. In a marketing context, this refers to the method in which a consumer extends a meaning to the marketing stimuli. The manner that a customer recognises such stimuli has a bearing on the buying decision process and the post-purchase behaviour. Customer perception matters to any commercial organisation as a primary aspect. Surveys have proven that one in every three customers leave a brand or a business due to even a single bad experience. This means that any company is not far from a situation where the customer perception and quality of service can take precedence over prices, features, benefits, or ease of usability. Hence, this is the reason for many successful organisations to invest lavishly in customer experience and perception.A processed approach to customer experience can be an obstacle to a business that deals constantly with customers. Certainly, the organisation must have a direction but excessive protocol and procedures should not get in the way of the real individual interactions. Being proactive to issues and reactive to customer grievances can improve goodwill tremendously. Getting involved with customers before the problem arises is the best approach rather than letting a situation escalates.   The most effective way to maximise customer value is to connect with the customers emotionally and address their elementary motivations.  Professional salesmen perform this task extremely skillfully. The actions of the staff carry a big weight with customers. The long-term interest and the commitment shown to customers can go a long way and retain customers indefinitely. Listening to the customer in an empathetic manner and discussing their concerns or complaints can provide more opportunities to emotionally attach.Genuine commitment to customer satisfaction is an important aspect of customer perception. However, the organisation must make sure that the customer is completely aware of such commitment. This can come through good marketing and advertising campaigns. Establishing principal operating values of the company is helpful to harmonious experience. Every customer in the world admires respect, integrity, customer focus, and the service delivery of a company, perhaps even more than the features or prices of a product.   Organisations set their standards on customer service usually by sending staff through a training process. The smaller organisation trains their staff on, on-the-job through the guidance of the seniors. However, when the core values are in place, the staff is aware of how to act in any given situation when a transaction takes place. When the operating values are enforced, as a rule, the service levels improve and customers will appreciate and continue to have high regard for the organisation. Also, the customers not only will expect such quality over and over again but also they will compare it with the competitors.Customer perceptionCustomers have everything at their fingertips today with more than adequately available online information. Therefore, their beliefs can be changed through such information. The customer perception changes when the societal trends, requirements, and needs alter. Therefore the companies need to remain or develop themselves to be at the same level as customers.    In the contemporary business world, service staff know how to treat customers from a human angle rather than considering them as mere customers who want to buy a product. They know when to be positive, when to ask questions, and also how to manage objections even when they are out of answers in a critical situation. These individual skills are most often mandatory for positive customer perception. However, these skillful actions come only with proper training and the knowledge and commitment derived through such training. Training on customer excellence must be continuous and constant to keep the staff on the edge. With the increasing customer knowledge through easily accessible information on the internet, they not only demand a satisfying service but also easily compare the organisation with competitors. By focusing on ongoing, perhaps on-the-job training helps companies to identify the areas that require improvement.    The easiest method to identify what customers think of the company is their own feedback. Having a good sense of customer perception is compulsory for a business. The idea of obtaining feedback is to discontinue what the majority of them dislike and improve on what they prefer or actually like. The most effective way to gather this information is to proactively respond to customer feedback. By collecting feedback, the company gets to know how they feel exactly towards the business.  SurveysThere are several methods and techniques to obtain customer feedback. Most successful companies conduct simple customer surveys, often combined with some type of incentive. These surveys currently can be conducted through social media conveniently and effectively. The vast majority of customers appreciate such efforts and willingly assist even if there is no personal incentive to them. Their basic behaviour is that even when they are irritated with the service, they will still be happy to comply as the company is genuinely trying to improve by gathering negative views of customers. Follow-up after every interaction is one of the most important aspects in developing customer perception. A catchy letter, e-mail, or a short message to the customer after a transaction is one of the best techniques to earn the trust of the customer. Any customer who receives a nicely worded brief message can create an ambiance that cannot be challenged by competitors.  Such communication is first hand, thus exceedingly effective. Failing in follow-up is a lost opportunity. Even If the customer is unhappy, and yet responding to the follow-up call or message gives the organisation a second chance. Experience reveals that if the company responds positively and optimistically to negative customers, they will continue to remain with the organisation as customers.  QualityThe quality of service is one of the highest priorities of customers.  Customers expect the companies to be trustworthy, transparent and the service to be top-notch. Scores of companies in Sri Lanka provide such quality services. For example, private banks, some supermarket chains, motor vehicle agents, and private hospitals often provide quality service to customers and frequently obtain feedback to improve service quality. Customers also count on the personalisation of the experience. They invariably admire exclusive attention when they become customers. The more personalised experience that companies offer, the more customers will be attracted to them. Companies maintain a database of customers and communicate with them personally on special occasions to build up an emotional rapport. By doing this, the company draws maximum usage of customer’s perception of personalisation and lets the customers become more loyal.  Renowned and respected American poet and civil rights activist said that she has learnt that people will forget what you said or what you did but they will never forget how you made them feel. Customer perception decides how the customers of a business feel about that business. This important sentiment makes them recommend such a brand, product, service, or the company to others.Hence, keeping a good focus on the positive customer perception helps the sustainability and growth of a business."
15 December 2019,Holiday season and impulse buying,"With improved income by way of bonuses and numerous promotional offers by various marketing organisations and channels, you are tempted to spend money on impulse buying – buying products and services that you can be without.Like your personal relationships, your financial situation can cause stress during this season. The strain of shopping, visiting friends and relatives, attending social gatherings and parties, and preparing holiday meals can make you really tired while the intention is to spend the season to treat yourself after an year of hard work, sweat and pain in a tough and most uncertain environment.Feeling exhausted increases your stress, creating a vicious cycle. Some try to celebrate with the intention of beating others – trying to outdo others. Holiday destinations, food and accommodation, entertaining friends and gifts are areas where comparisons are made. Know your capacity and do what’s right for you.Business organisations on the other hand would plan to cash in their old stocks and increase the overall volume of business.Given that the competition gets intense with temporarily bloated valets of the customers every single business will offer various incentives to entice the customers to benefit from the seasonal demand. Certainly it’s a good idea to get the benefit from this business climate, but you should use more of your head than your heart.The idea of a holiday season is to bring your stress level down and be rejuvenated to enhance performance post holiday season. You shouldn’t do anything during the holiday season that is unplanned, but use the space meaningfully to treat you and your family well. Set aside specific days and budgets for shopping, travelling, visiting friends and other activities. This will help prevent a last-minute scramble to buy gifts, going places, visiting relatives which can be counterproductive.The right choiceBefore you go shopping, decide how much money you can afford to spend on gifts and other items. Then be sure to stick to your budget. If you don’t, you could feel anxious and tense for months afterward as you struggle to pay the bills.Learn to say no. Believe it or not, people will understand if you can’t do certain activities during this period. If you say yes only to what you really want to do, you’ll avoid feeling resentful and overwhelmed. If it’s really not possible to say no when your boss asks you to work overtime, try to remove something else from your agenda to make up for the lost time.When to attackFor businesses, there is a choice to make between joining the band wagon with competitive offers vs using the budgets when others are silent so you can stand out. It may be more profitable and effective for you to attack your competitors when they have depleted their budgets. Making some time for yourself during the holiday season with annual eave being used is paramount. Spending sometime on your own, without distractions, may refresh you enough. Don’t resolve to change your whole life to make up for past excess.Instead, try to return to basic, healthy lifestyle routines. Set smaller, more specific goals with a reasonable time frame. Space you would find during a long holiday season is the best for this. In real life, people don’t usually resolve problems within an hour or two. Something always comes up. Remember that one key to minimising holiday stress and depression is knowing that the holidays can trigger stress and depression. Accept that things aren’t always going to go as planned. Then take active steps to manage stress and depression during the holidays. You may actually enjoy the holidays this year more than you thought you could. "
20 December 2020,Entrepreneurs must adapt to change to face the pandemic,"The outbreak of Covid-19 has severely affected national and global economies. Enterprises and entrepreneurs are facing various issues with certain degrees of losses.Medium scale firms are highly dependent on routine business transactions and limited number of customers. As they provide a major section of global employment they cannot be ignored. Unfortunately medium scale business have been hit the hardest.While a business during a pandemic might not seem like an ideal endeavour, but it actually could be a great entrepreneurial decision as well. There are many ideas sprouting in the business world today.It is the talent of an entrepreneur to understand and adapt to challenges and start a thriving business during the pandemic. While the 'struggle is real' attribute plays a vital role in the life of entrepreneurs.The pandemic has set new definitions to a lot of things including lifestyle, luxury and in our case, booming business. Fields that once set milestones in trade and business have fallen into the shadows. Practical thinking and business built on geographical understanding have survived and are looking promising.Setting up medium scale businesses is the current trend. With social media being the promotion platform the cost of launching a business has come down. Today, everybody on that path is an entrepreneur. However, this does not mean that life is easy and jobs are a jolly ride.A few entrepreneurs came forward with their insight in the struggle to survive in the world of trade in this time of crisis.VrarieCally Balthazar of Cally Reusable Bags: ""My business has severely been affected due to the lockdown. Hence, in retailing my product obviously I have to struggle a lot. Tourist hotspots are devoid of tourists. This has made it a lot more difficult to market my products.As they are reusable bags you need to be able to go out.“I think the idea of online shopping is so prevalent that only a few people are heading out to buy goods and it's almost like the desire to purchase eco-friendly products has died and it's very sad and tragic. I mean very few people are really considering the environment as a cause, and that conversation on single use plastic, polythene and so on were coming up so nicely but now it died off right after covid-19.""Business is good for people who have created online platforms, but for me it continues to be a struggle. Businesses that have taken loans find it very difficult. Although I'm trying to increase sales I understand the situation where people think twice before purchasing what they consider as non-essentials,"" she said. Cally believes that as an entrepreneur of any kind of business, you need to be little emphatic and little more understanding of the people's needs at present.""The truth is it's really been a struggle and it continues to be a struggle and everyone is trying to do the best they could and it includes me. I think the need is to look online but it is important for me to keep the ethos and values of the brand. So it's really a struggle,"" said Cally.""The Covid-19 pandemic has sent the economy into its depression. But, MLM businesses have grown up, and the coronavirus has created more opportunities for them.MLM marketeer at Best Life Group of Companies, Sri Lanka, Fazeeha said, ""We have benefited more during this situation. We use multiple effective strategies for time management. We host virtual MLM meetings. We use this time more to achieve our business goals. We also offer education based training.""""When compared to the other industries or businesses, I wouldn't say, we are heavily impacted. Not that we weren't affected. The impact was around 70%. Shana Haniffa said, ""We have tried to deliver our food through Uber Eats as it has a wider audience and reach. We have also tried reducing the price of our food items. We are looking into other home based business ventures to diversify and find another source of income.""The above reports clearly show the unpredictable nature of businesses and the impact of Covid-19 on them. Nothing can be taken for granted. A thorough analysis of pre-setup of businesses looks promising but that too is prone to change. This fluctuation is going to remain with us for a few years. The whole world is undergoing socio-economic hardship. Watchfulness is what is going to hold medium scale business from going bankrupt. Entrepreneurs are trying their best to be innovative and succeed."

10 May 2021,Negotiation techniques and skills bring success in business,"“In business as in life, you don’t get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate” is the title of a book authored by the subject wizard Dr. Lester L. Karrass. I came across this phrase nearly 30 years ago when I was attending a sales training session as a junior salesman. I neither recall the name of the young and vivacious trainer nor the exact contents of the delivery, but the phrase never left my memory until now because I have never ceased to believe the truth in the statement.As defined by Wikipedia, Negotiation is a dialogue between two or more people or parties intended to reach a beneficial outcome over one or more issues where a conflict exists concerning at least one of these issues. Negotiation is an interaction and process between entities who aspire to agree on matters of mutual interest while optimizing their utilities.In a literary sense, what you negotiate in business gets what you deserve. The entrepreneurs, senior managers, and sales professionals, throughout their respective careers, constantly engage in negotiating with others as one of their most productive professional tasks. The techniques first and the skill subsequently determines the success of a business transaction, big or small. Having said that, I have to state that everyone born into the world, at one time or another, involves themselves in negotiations at different levels right through their business or personal lives.   There are three types of negotiators we come across in business. Firstly, soft bargainers who use gentle negotiation tactics in a transaction. Usually, they attempt to avoid confrontations and maintain a friendly and cordial attitude with other negotiators and persist in agreement rather than resistance.The hard negotiators mostly attempt to push their way through at the discussion table using even high-handed tactics. Hard bargainers apply pressure throughout the negotiation and rely only on victory rather than mutual agreements or benefits. Hard bargainers usually treat others as adversaries and untrustworthy.The third is the principled negotiator who seeks integrative and mutually beneficial solutions. They concentrate on the issue rather than the interests and reach agreements on independent personal views. They base their efforts on objectives more than power or self-interest and act on moral standards, traditions and professionalism. Important techniques‘Integrative negotiation’ and ‘adversarial bargaining’ are two important techniques in negotiation. Integrative bargaining is known to be a civilised and assertive method of negotiating with solutions found in win-win situations. The strategy is to find mutually agreeable decisions that satisfy the needs of each of the bargaining parties. This process often involves brainstorming with all concerned parties and pooling knowledge to find the best solution.‘Adversarial bargaining’ is quite contrary. Also known as distributive bargaining, the method involves tough demands, threats, or bluffs. While in certain negotiations, particularly political and legal, the negotiators play hardball and treat the other negotiating parties as competitors.  This method is rarely successful in commercial negotiations. The process, behaviour, and agenda are the three elements of negotiation. The process is the way an individual negotiates with others using various techniques and strategies to reach a solution. The behaviour is how the two or more parties interact with each other and communicate their respective points clearly to the others in the discussion. The third element, the substance is the topic and the agenda on which the individuals of the negotiating parties continue the dialogue.   Various types of negotiations take place in business. The most frequent out of these are the negotiations that occur in the workplace. Dialogues between the superiors and employees, discussions among fellow employees on official matters, and conversations and discussions with other stakeholders constantly go on as day-to-day negotiations in business entities.Winning negotiationCommercial negotiations are discussions generally done across a table engaging two or more groups to find solutions to a mutually important business subject. Usually, commercial negotiations end up in mutual agreement with conditions acceptable to all negotiating parties. The pros and cons are evaluated and deciding on an agreeable alternative best suited are found in a winning negotiation.  Negotiation techniques are referred to the style and methods deployed by negotiators during a discussion whether they are commercial or private. There are certain unwritten rules, regulations, and ethics involved in good negotiations. The conversations must be pleasant and conclusions must be amicable to be fruitful to negotiating parties.  Preparing for the negotiation, particularly in business discussions, with everything related to the subject is perhaps the foremost technique on the negotiating table. Negotiators must be able to counter any objection, argument, or comment successfully. Therefore, researching the minutest details of the subject with adequate information is imperative.Before arriving at the bargaining table, it is imperative to analyse and decide the best alternatives to determine the loss in case the negotiation fails. Your best weapon in a hard negotiation is your ability and willingness to walk away. Therefore, good negotiators identify the best alternatives to the final agreement. This technique is common to both integrative negotiations and adversarial bargaining. In any negotiation, business or personal, posture and body movements play a big role. You must look confident and act confident to earn the respect of the opposing person or group. Self-assured speech patterns and positive verbatim can provide the desired edge at a serious negotiation. Showing signs of insecurity or nervousness can bring unfavourable results in a negotiation.Being focused on the specific subject matter will convince the counterparts that you are serious and you mean business. By displaying the focus and the meticulousness, you tend to earn continuous respect of the counterparts.  Valuable informationBeing a patient listener is important in bargaining.  When you actively listen to the other party carefully, you will know exactly what they expect as the outcome. It makes things easier for you to express disagreement or displeasure at once. Your exemplary listening skills not only will get hold of valuable information but also your counterparts will see you as a reasonable negotiatorThe ultimate goal of a negotiation is to reach an amicable solution with the counterparts. Therefore, building rapport with the others before the negotiation starts can bring superior results. All other negotiating groups could be more collaborative if you spend a few minutes in the beginning to break the ice. After all, any transaction must reach an agreement to be successful.In a commercial negotiation, it’s always good to ask questions from time to time. The likely questions must be pre-arranged for them to be more productive. The discussions become more integrative with the right questions at the right time. A smart negotiator prepares his questions leading the answers by the counterparts. On the other hand, questions make the gray areas of the subject matter clearer. Presenting multiple equivalent offers at the initial stage is a good negotiating strategy. Instead of making proposals one by one, you can table several offers together as a bundle. By doing that you are influencing and leading the other parties to accept part of your deal. When they accept part of the offers, it is easy for you to improve other parts of the proposals and can be done on mutual understanding. Also, even if your counterpart accepts a few out of many, you are still in a winning position.The disposition and the personality with the understanding of negotiating techniques create a stable component of a negotiator. A good negotiator is flexible in the bargaining table by being either cooperative or hard as a professional depending on the person across the table. The ability to negotiate well is one of the most important attributes one can possess in business which can bring what you desire."

5 July 2020,SEC meets capital market stakeholders,"The Chairman and members of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) met representatives of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, law firms and stockbroker firms recently.These interactions were held as part of a series of meetings that the SEC has commenced with various stakeholders since January. Chairman Viraj Dayaratne briefed the delegates on the reasons that prevented the stock market from being opened during the curfew.

This transformation is expected to enable stockbrokers to strengthen service delivery, improve efficiency and have greater agility.The delegation from the Chamber stressed the need to encourage more companies to list and to have in place an apex committee comprising capital market stakeholders including the SEC, CSE, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Finance and other key policy makers including industry bodies to decide on matters related to capital market policy.The Chairman called upon the delegates to point out any particular Rules or Regulations which they consider to be too rigid so that they could be looked at by the SEC. "
9 August 2020,Smith has ‘unfinished business’ with England and India,"SYDNEY AFP: Winning the Ashes in England and clinching a Test series in India are the “two big mountains” still to climb before master Australia batsman Steve Smith considers retirement.The 31-year-old had an astonishing tour of England last year, blazing 774 runs from just four Tests, having missed the third Test with concussion after being hit by a Jofra Archer bouncer.But his exploits were only enough for Tim Paine’s side to retain the fabled Ashes urn as holders, rather than win it outright, with the series ending 2-2 after Australia lost the fifth and final Test at The Oval.Smith said it left him disappointed and with “unfinished business”.“To know that we’d got the Ashes back was pretty special,” he told The Unplayable Podcast this week. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t win them which is something I’d still like to do.“From my personal perspective, I think it’s unfinished business,” he added. “It’s great to retain the Ashes but it just doesn’t sit right with me when you don’t win it. We drew the series -- good, but not great.“So I probably left at the end of the fifth Test (feeling) more disappointed than a sense of achievement.”The last time Australia won an Ashes series in England was 2001 when Steve Waugh’s men achieved the feat.The two sides are scheduled to meet again in Australia next year before returning to England in mid-2023, when Smith will be 34.A series win in India is another major driver for the former Australian captain, who has notched 7,227 runs in his 73 Tests so far, with 26 hundreds.“They’re the two big mountains to climb and if you can do that, it would be pretty special,” said Smith, with winning a series in India eluding Australia since 2004.“Hopefully I get another crack at it, we’ll see how we go. I’m getting a bit old now. You never know how long I’ve got left and you never know what the future holds.“But it’s certainly something to strive for, that’s for sure.”"
28 June 2020,Nations Trust Bank to help economic revival,"Nations Trust Bank has launched a Rs. 7 billion internally generated fund dedicated to extend financial support to key industries thereby, enabling them to recommence their businesses and in turn boost the national economy.“We have an important role to play in supporting economic revival and uplifting businesses.

26 September 2021,Reconfigure your business strategy to align with changes,"The pandemic may have wiped your strategy slate clean with changes in the ecosystem dictated by the pandemic, but you have also garnered invaluable experience needed for turnaround.You may have discovered the best in you and smarter ways of operating the business. Some may have realised that their attitude towards managing the crisis was wrong. Now it’s time to bring together your ‘think tank’ and use those lessons to reconfigure your business and operating models for the next normal world.Re-set your expectations-achieving pre-pandemic level would be a bad notion to have. Instead audit the ecosystem – reconfigure your business strategy and reset your goals based on new opportunities and competitive advantages.Absorb lessonsEach enterprise should take its own path depending on the new nature of the industry. Some could reduce or retire specific non-value adding business activities. Others could rescale or reinvent themselves. During highly disruptive times, it is possible to think about renewal as you grapple with your triage response and recovery. Re-imagine your organisation’s future.Don’t relish the disruption; you must seize the day and look for better ways to operate and seize the new opportunities rather than regaining the old business. Mind you it’s a mind-set that I propose when approaching the future for growth.Agile decision making and strategy re-setting result in outsized performance — and establishes a lead over the competition that sustains long after the initial disruption. As you weed out weaknesses in your people, business and operating models, you are better positioned to weather the next disruption.In the absence of a complete cure for Covid-19, any rebound in business activity could easily be followed by another round of response, recover, renew, so the imperative is to absorb lessons learned quickly and build sustainable changes into business and operating models.But first, you need to determine exactly where and how the crisis has stretched and broken your existing models — and where the risks and opportunities lie as a result. Identify significant uncertainties and evaluate them in terms of their importance to the future of the enterprise.In the highly disrupted environment, create a minimum viable strategy and use adaptive strategy making to iterate as your next normal emerges. Make strategic planning a continual activity so it can respond quickly to the inevitable changes in business context.Reset for a sustainable futureIt is in the renewal phase that wise leaders take the opportunity to reset or rebuild their business models and operations for a new reality. From ‘recovery’ to ‘reconfigure, rescale, reinvent, return, reduce and retire’ would be wiser and more objective oriented.For some, the pandemic has stressed business and operating models to the point of breaking. Organisations will ultimately reduce or retire those activities permanently. This could include moving some business capabilities out into the ecosystem or removing a product or service entirely.In some cases, retirement is long overdue anyway and this would be the best opportunity. Some organisations may reset by reinventing themselves for the long term. Likely examples are manufacturers that have switched production facilities to create new product suites, or retailers that have found new ways and new ecosystems in which to reach customers who can’t visit their physical locations.Others could reinvent themselves by refocusing their capacity. Think of government service centers that have been forced to offer their services remotely. They may be able to retire some of their physical centers and instead focus on their newfound digital abilities.Yet others, such as digitalised parts of an organisation, might rescale permanently. Yours may be one of the businesses that resettle toward the pre-pandemic baseline, but it won’t have been a straight path. Manufacturers of nonperishable consumer goods are a good example. They initially experienced surging demand, but could easily see demand sink as the crisis-driven overstocking corrects. But that phase, too, will pass, returning demand toward pre-pandemic levels.What will your future be? This crisis has created an opportunity to reset some of your goals and ambitions; it’s time to ask: “As we recover from this crisis, do we want to be different — and if so, how?” "
11 October 2020,External sector recovers in August,"Sri Lanka’s external sector continued to recover in relation to many aspects during August 2020, mainly supported by an improved trade deficit and a notable increase in workers’ remittances, the Central Bank announced last week.The trade deficit improved on a year-on-year basis, with the reduction in merchandise imports due to regulatory restrictions on the importation of non-essential goods and lower crude oil prices, despite earnings from merchandise exports recording a year-on-year decline during the month.Nevertheless, the export performance remained strong for the third consecutive month in spite of the pandemic affected global demand. Workers’ remittances recorded a substantial growth in August 2020, strengthening the current account. In the financial account, marginal foreign investment outflows were recorded from the government securities market, while the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) also recorded some foreign investment outflows during the month.With increased net inflows to the domestic foreign exchange market, the Central Bank was able to absorb foreign exchange during the month to build gross official reserves. The Sri Lankan rupee, which had some volatility in mid August, stabilised towards the end of the month.The deficit in the trade account in August 2020 narrowed to US dollars 342 million from US dollars 541 million in August 2019, as imports declined at a faster pace than the decline in exports. Also, on a cumulative basis, the trade deficit narrowed by over US dollar one billion to US dollars 3,812 million from January to August 2020 from US dollars 4,855 million in the corresponding period of 2019."
2 August 2020,  Can business acumen lead to political prowess?,"Everyone blames politicians for the state the country is in, but in the absence of an alternative, the voters have elected those fielded by political parties. Law and order, bribery and corruption, human rights, inequality and unfair distribution of wealth, politically biased decision making, policy inconsistency and poor economic performance have been spoken about as being the major issues. Given that backdrop, over the past decade, the idea of a business leader (or a popular sports star) turning into a politician and policymaker has been gaining momentum in Sri Lanka. Yet, one wonders whether leading corporations or a sports team results in a great preparation for the world of politics and policy making. Perhaps it only makes the newly minted politician particularly vulnerable to the limits of political life and ventures.The obvious pitfalls and challenges have been illustrated by a number of business leaders and sports stars who have taken the lead in government. Actual incidents in Sri Lanka over the past decade where leaders either got elected and sought election but could not deliver, serve as a reminder of these challenges – and the difference in leadership between politics and other fields.Most individuals turned politicians have resulted in total rejection and censure, lack of performance or reluctantly embracing the authentic political culture giving up on their principles and goals to force a change they thought was better for the country. Those drawbacks are repeated in national and local governments as these leaders recast themselves as politicians. Business leaders are accustomed to operational efficiencies where disorganisation is handled with brutal proficiency. The checks and balances, accountability and oversight found in government are ingrained into the policy apparatus and can drain the effectiveness and speed of seemingly feasible solutions.Unlike running a business, a model of leadership based on meeting the interests of a small list of stakeholders, policy leadership involves building a coalition of often competing interests while serving the needs of a large number of constituents at varying levels.CompromiseAppealing to every key segment needs alignment which demands a huge compromise on the value system you have embraced and lived by as a business leader. Stars of sports, cinema and other popular fields of art have no experience in handling such diversity, volume and its complexities. Understanding the differences in diversity, risk, efficiency, and target audience interests in these areas are the key to understanding the differences in leadership between politics and other disciplines and no one in Sri Lanka so far has encountered these pitfalls successfully to achieve their political goals – that’s the fact though there is still a school of thought that successful business leaders entering politics is the solution to many issues the country is grappling with.Politics, at its heart, needs building and maintaining a coalition of support among  people you wouldn’t otherwise want to even talk to. Leadership isn’t necessarily replicable from one corporate venue to another and certainly not from one field to the next though the majority doesn’t like to accept this fact.Being a wildly successful entrepreneur needs not only growing a solid business, but also giving the entire enterprise an aura of something larger than life. They spend years crafting an image of what their business is, and honing their own personal brand. Political decisions need much harder calculations than those entrepreneurs need to do.The first step towards transforming from a business person to successful political negotiator is to realise your limitations. They would need to come up to speed on what they can and can’t do with the kinds of analysis many business leaders use. Political strategy by nature is very fluid and flexibility is needed to make people happy in the short term which clearly compromises the long term results.Wealth creationGiven that our country’s future depends on how we can increase wealth and not in a more equitable way to distribute the wealth, creation of wealth is the primary job of a politician in today’s context with acute strategy. Yes, business leaders are good strategists but they need to get into power to do this.The issue is, you need to do politics to appeal to the majority of voters whose level of education is below par. This is where business leaders have failed and will fail. Business leaders stick to a given plan no matter what others think, but politicians plan their work around what people think. In politics, compared to business, there are potentially many more people and issues that can affect how decisions are made and things turn out – most issues you have no control over. In politics, there may also be less sorting by expertise and background. People with a hunger for power can succeed in politics without knowing very much or even knowing how to get the needed knowledge.They might even disparage others’ knowledge, in deference to their own intuitions. In business, one is more likely to interact with people who are familiar with their domain and who want to know all that they can. While these two propositions may look alike on the surface the reality is that they are completely opposite in thought process and action. That is why some think business leaders can succeed in business is because of that. In short, political leaders need to realise their own cognitive capacity because their actions aren’t restricted within their own industry. Ego and image may make up a good chunk of someone’s business manoeuvering, but in politics, the stakes are higher and more stratified.Brash, unscripted hand waves may catch people’s eyes in the moment, but there’s no way to know what will follow. And political negotiations need a more honed and keen eye to be conducted successfully.Whether or not the future of politics is drawn from business learning or something entirely different, it’s important for leaders to be reflective and critical. They must be ready to learn as the scope of their decisions and negotiations increase.The greater the shift in domains, the more difficult that task becomes. Finally, I ask this question – are you happy with the performance of previous business leaders or professionals who entered politics? Did they change the journey of politics or did they turn out to be ‘politicians’ at the end. "
8 August 2021,SL will be competency centre for AI in Asia – SLASSCOM chairperson,"Sri Lanka is fast becoming a strategic hub in the region for global companies and investors setting up regional offices, innovation hubs and centres of excellence, said Sandra De Zoysa, the recently appointed Chairperson of SLASSCOM (Sri Lanka Association for Software Services Companies), the first female to head the national chamber for the knowledge and innovation industry in Sri Lanka.Upbeat about the immense potential of the industry, De Zoysa said Sri Lanka’s IT and BPM industry has been powering global brands with Sri Lankan ingenuity over the past three decades and added using Sri Lanka as a test-bed and regional hub to enter into the fast-growing markets in Asia due to its proximity and strategic location with strong social indicators from literacy to infrastructure to climate, the hospitable people and ease of doing business the country is on the path to be a strategic hub in the region soon.She said the government and its vision supports the IT/BPM industry in its growth trajectory as it is the fastest-growing export sector for the country with year-on-year double digit growth thus far and over the last decade, has grown by 300%.“SLASSCOM is happy to be a part of the presidential task force facilitating the acceleration of global trade and foreign direct investment, infrastructure development, policy reform and education which will enable investment and expansion in local businesses and start-ups who are developing relevant domain specific transformational IP, innovative products and services,” De Zoysa said.USPOn her plans for SLASSCOM, she said elevating the identity of the Island of Ingenuity brand as the country’s USP (Unique Selling Proposition) with a positive image of Sri Lanka as a premier destination for IT and BPM (Business Process Management) including sustainable innovation and building capability that would enable Sri Lankan enterprises to create high-value technology products and platforms that would be recognised globally while bringing in revenue through foreign funding, exits and sales. SLASSCOM is in discussion with Port City Colombo to explore collaboration opportunities which will have a positive impact on the IT and BPM industry as Artificial Intelligence is an area of common interest.To achieve business excellence, SLASSCOM aims to position Sri Lanka as a key competency centre for Artificial Intelligence in Asia by being a catalyst for growth and adoption of AI in Sri Lanka through its AI Centre of Excellence (AICx) chaired by expert Dr. Romesh Ranawana.The Chamber envisions positioning Sri Lanka as a global cybersecurity hub with an ambitious goal of achieving export revenue of $500 million while producing 8,000 to 10,000 cybersecurity professionals to cater to the global demand for cybersecurity products and services. De Zoysa said that the launch of the Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence (CSCx) at a crucial time following Covid-19 which saw an increase in cyber-attacks with work from home, opened numerous opportunities for Sri Lanka to be a global player in cybersecurity offerings.To position the country as a global IA (Intelligent Automation) provider, SLASSCOM launched its latest initiative the IA Centre of Excellence which endeavours to promote the adoption of IA among local tech companies and its member companies through technology driven linear processes that would increase efficiency and competitiveness.SLASSCOM hopes to achieve higher female participation in value-creating job roles through the SLASSCOM Women Technopreneur initiative.“We will encourage entrepreneurship support at each stage: ideation, initiation, incorporation, acceleration and maturation, and linking the start-up ecosystem through the mentorship program while focusing on greater member engagement and value creation for our over 350 members of which nearly 50% are start-up organisations,” the chamber chief said.Thrust industrySri Lanka’s knowledge services industry is currently estimated to be USD 1.2 billion with over 80,000 employees engaged in the industry.The knowledge solutions industry has been identified as a thrust industry by the government within the National Export Strategy (NES) and targets USD 5 billion of exports while creating 200,000 new jobs and 1,000 start-ups by next year.SLASSCOM, the Chamber that acts as a catalyst for growth in the knowledge and innovation industry, comprises over 350 member companies.SLASSCOM’s key strategic initiatives are run by nine forums (Marketing, Capacity, Regional Development, Entrepreneurship, Technology, Quality, Business Process Management, Innovation, Human Resources) and four accelerators (Cyber Cx, AICx, Product and Platform Council and IA Cx). Each of these forums and accelerators is composed of industry leaders and volunteers from its membership.De Zoysa is the Group Chief Customer Officer at Dialog Axiata and her career in the ICT industry spans three decades and is the longest serving employee in the mobile telecommunication industry.She was the first female to join Celltel in 1989 which saw the birth of Customer Service / Customer Experience Management in Sri Lanka, a global thought leader in Digital Customer Experience Management with many awards and accolades. She has been a visiting lecturer for over a decade at the University of Colombo School of Computing and has represented Sri Lanka at over 250 global conferences. At SLASSCOM, she has held many key leadership positions including Vice Chairperson, Finance Director, Operations Director, and has led Quality, Branding and Communications, Tech Kidz, and Women Technopreneur initiatives.On her appointment, De Zoya said, “I am humbled and honoured to have been the first female appointed to the Board and now to be elected as Chairperson. The secret to SLASSCOM’s success is founded on the strength of our wide network of members and its dedicated volunteers who are industry experts.”"

3 May 2020,Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange woes ,"Growing pressure on Sri Lanka’s scarce foreign exchange resources, due to the spread of COVID-19 across the globe, is now more real than ever before. To ease this pressure, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has taken many measures to attract and retain more foreign exchange in Sri Lanka.On March 19, the CBSL curtailed the import of non-essential goods, followed by the relaxation of its foreign exchange regulations on April 2. The CBSL invited Sri Lankans and well-wishers living in the country and abroad to deposit their savings and other funds in foreign currency to the Sri Lankan banking system.This invitation came with the assurance that such deposits will be accepted without any hindrance from the government, CBSL, or any other authority. More recently, the Finance Minister suspended outward remittances, other than current transactions through Business or Personal Foreign Currency Accounts, reduced the first time migration allowance to a maximum of USD 30,000, and introduced a Special Deposit Account, which can be opened with inward remittances and would be eligible to a higher interest rate.Yet, it is uncertain if these efforts alone would be able to address Sri Lanka’s deepening foreign exchange concerns. This blog highlights the importance of remittances to Sri Lanka and outlines how to harness the potential of international remittances to complement other efforts already taken by the CBSL.Remittance economySri Lanka is often identified as a remittance economy, due its heavy reliance on remittances. In 2019, the Sri Lankan economy received USD 6.7 billion as remittances, which was capable of covering 84% of its trade deficit. Moreover, recent estimates show that one in every 11 households received international remittances, migrants normally remit once a month, and the average amount remitted is Rs. 40,000 per month.Seasonality of remittancesRemittances to Sri Lanka are seasonal, and traditionally, peak in the months of April, right before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, and in December, the month of Christmas. During the five year period from 2015 to 2019, on average, March has brought in USD 633 million as remittances (See table).LockdownsHowever, by the end of March 2020, a majority of the top destination countries of Sri Lankan migrant workers had come under lockdown, in an effort to combat the spread of COVID-19.For instance, around March 9, all schools and universities were closed in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, followed by the subsequent closure of all restaurants, cafes, food outlets, and food trucks in popular areas.By March 20, many labour camps in Qatar – home to migrant workers in the construction sector - were also locked down. Similarly, a large expanse of the industrial areas in Qatar employing migrant workers, was also locked down.While some migrant workers continue to get paid, others in these labour camps and industrial areas were provided no pay leave, with facilities for food and accommodation.Adding fuel to the flame, the rift between Saudi Arabia and Russia over the supply of oil, in the wake of declining demand for oil in the world market, has resulted in a huge fall in oil prices since March 9. Together with other issues related to COVID-19 in countries of destination (COD), the impending global recession means less stability and job security for Sri Lankan-origin migrant workers, who under normal circumstances would remit regularly.Travel bansWhile migrant workers living abroad were locked down, new or returning migrants from Sri Lanka were temporarily banned from entering many countries of destination by mid-March.Initially Qatar imposed a travel ban that restricted Sri Lankan origin migrant workers entering the country, while Kuwait and Saudi Arabia followed suit by mid-March. Subsequently, on 14 March, the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLBFE) restricted migrant workers leaving the country for foreign employment. As such, the regular flow of migrant departures were curtailed in mid-March, resulting in a decline in the stock of migrant workers overseas, and thereby, triggering the likely decline in remitters.Migrants and remittancesThe decline in the stock of migrants and the economic difficulties faced by those in CODs translate into lower remittances to Sri Lanka. For those who were paid, the timing of the lockdowns made it harder to remit their wages via traditional methods, such as visiting a bank or a money transfer operator (MTO). For those who were not paid, remitting to Sri Lanka was not even an option, especially under the growing concerns about their job security.Remittance channelsUnder normal circumstances, most migrant workers of Sri Lankan origin prefer to remit money via the banking channel, mainly as a result of information provided during pre-departure training in Sri Lanka.For instance, in a sample of 602 migrant households in Sri Lankan, 81% indicated that remittances from the countries of destination were sent via banks, while another 9% used MTOs.For most female domestic workers in the Middle East, the nature of work and workplace enable remittances through a bank account of the employer, often via online bank transfers. High skilled migrants are also most likely to adopt online methods for remittances. Such groups are less likely to be affected by lockdowns and curfews to remit money to Sri Lanka.Nevertheless, low skilled workers other than female domestic workers are more likely to rely on traditional brick and mortar methods for remittances, and are likely to be the ones to cut back on their remittances to Sri Lanka in these trying times.Informal and illegal remittance channelsSome migrants resort to informal and illegal channels, mainly due to the lower cost of remitting, and other reasons, such as absence of a need to prove legal status in COD and door-step delivery in Sri Lanka. Recent estimates indicate that the average cost of remitting to Sri Lanka via the banking channels is 5.4% of the amount remitted, while via the MTO channels the cost is 3.7%. There are no reliable estimates about the share of remittances sent via informal and illegal channels, or its cost.The informal and illegal channels of remittances operate by the remittance service provider collecting remittances in the COD (in foreign currency), and distributing the same in Sri Lanka using his/her Rupee funds in Sri Lanka, often through a partner here. Such operations restrict much needed foreign exchange from reaching Sri Lanka.Instead, foreign exchange destined to Sri Lanka remains in the COD.This is a serious concern in the current context, with the decline of foreign exchange to Sri Lanka.Future scenarioThe travel restrictions on many countries are likely to remain effective in the next couple of months, eliminating the possibility of departures for the already processed and approved job orders from Sri Lanka. On the other hand, the approaching global recession will decrease the demand for foreign workers.At the same time, migrant workers currently in CODs will undergo severe economic stress, or will be compelled to return to Sri Lanka if rendered unemployed.Similarly, the migrant workers, who were able to return to Sri Lanka, especially from Italy, before the closure of borders in mid-March, are very likely to be laid off, and not have a job to return to in the future. As such, even after the travel restrictions are lifted, the availability of employment opportunities for migrant workers from Sri Lanka would be slim. Together, all these factors will contribute to a decline in the stock of Sri Lankan origin migrant workers, and thereby a drop in remittances to Sri Lanka in 2020.Way forwardIn this context, to address the growing foreign exchange concerns, Sri Lanka needs to adopt aggressive measures to increase the amount of foreign exchange received as international remittances in 2020. In addition to the already proposed measure by the CBSL, the following are some strategies to maximise the receipt of remittances to Sri Lanka in 2020:1. Encourage migrant workers currently under lockdown in CODs to adopt online methods to remit money to Sri Lanka. The SLBFE and the Ministry of Foreign Employment can adopt a targeted social media campaign to reach Sri Lankan migrant workers abroad.2. Encourage Sri Lankan banks operating in CODs to adopt doorstep collection methods to encourage remittances by Sri Lankans in lockdown. The CBSL and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can spearhead this effort by guiding the Sri Lankan missions in CODs to liaise with relevant financial authorities in CODs to enable such a maneuver.3. Offer benefits for those collecting remittances from formal channels in Sri Lanka, thereby mobilizing remittance receivers in Sri Lanka to influence remitters overseas. A few strategies to implement this would be to:1. Provide doorstep delivery of remittances in Sri Lanka by commercial banks and MTOs during curfew hours. The CBSL could guide commercial banks and MTOs to offer such facilities.2. Commercial banks take initiatives to provide much needed in-kind assistance, for those collecting remittances via formal channels.4. Encourage those using informal channels to use formal channels. Towards this effort, a global dialogue needs to be initiated to:1. Negotiate with MTOs and exchange houses operating in CODs to reduce their fees for remittances, to lower the cost of remittances in formal channels.2. Relax documentary requirements in formal channels to attract more remitters into formal channels.The writer is a Research Fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka."
4 October 2020,Huge increase in CDS account openings since digitalisation,"The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has recorded consistent gains in the All Share Price Index of 31% and S & P Index of 27% since reopening on May 11, 2020, a media release from the CSE stated.Sri Lanka is one of the markets that has recovered the fastest from the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic in comparison to countries in the Asia Pacific region recording positive price returns in US Dollar terms.This reflects the confidence the investors have placed in the market and the future economic growth of the country. Significant contributions to turnover has been recorded in Colombo, Gampaha, Kandy, Kurunegala, Galle, Kalutara and Matara districts.Local investors have recognised the potential in the market especially in terms of attractive market valuations and growth potential of Sri Lankan listed companies and contributed to approximately 68% of the total market turnover.There was an increase of over 63% in Central Depository System (CDS) account openings since the digitalisation of end-to-end operations of the market on September 17.Digitalisation of the market has afforded investors the opportunity to access the market with ease and convenience and has contributed further to increase the depth of the market. To strengthen the regulatory framework, facilitate market infrastructure and increase investor confidence and protection, the SEC has taken many measures including the finalisation of a new SEC Act in line with international standards, which has been presented to the Ministry of Finance.The new Act will enable the SEC to engage in effective and holistic regulation and preserve trust and confidence in the market."
1 March 2020,Poland keen on FTA with Sri Lanka,"Poland is keen to enter into a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Sri Lanka to boost the current trade volume but before that certain bureaucratic hurdles need to be addressed for both countries to benefit fully from the FTA, said Polish Ambassador to Sri Lanka Adam Burakowski last week.The ambassador was addressing a seminar on ‘Bilateral trade between Sri Lanka and Poland’ organised by the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka.“A free trade agreement with Sri Lanka or for that matter with any other country has to be initiated by the European Union (EU) office in Colombo,” the ambassador said.Bilateral trade between Sri Lanka and Poland as of 2018 was US$ 156 million and it has been in favour of Sri Lanka.The export of tea, spices, and garments, among other products from Sri Lanka to Poland grew to $ 106 million while imports such as paper, paper board, steel, machinery, and agricultural and electrical equipment from Poland increased from $ 18 million to $ 30 million in 2017.“There is ample room for trade volume between Sri Lanka and Poland to increase as both countries have a lot to offer each other.The embassy will take up the concerns of Sri Lankan exporters and explore ways and means to address them soon,” Burakowski said.The business sector representatives of Sri Lanka raised concerns about the delay in obtaining a visa to travel to Poland due to the absence of a visa office in Colombo.The silver lining for both countries was the launch of direct flights from Warsaw to Colombo late last year.However, the move has not gone down well for local entrepreneurs planning to increase trade and investments in Poland due to the hassle of travelling.“We hope the Embassy of Poland will consider setting up an office in Colombo to expedite travel,” a gem and jewellery merchant said.Sri Lanka and Poland established diplomatic ties in 1957 and marked 60 years of diplomatic relations in 2017. Relations between the two countries have remained firm despite not extending into many areas of cooperation.Both countries have enjoyed excellent relations, which have extended into political, economic and cultural aspects.Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland accompanied a business delegation to Sri Lanka in 2015 while a Sri Lankan business delegation visited Poland for bilateral talks in 2018.“Medicinal items, processed food and poultry and agri-products are some of the areas where both countries could work on increasing trade,” the Polish ambassador said, adding that tourism is a key area which both countries should pursue.Sri Lanka recorded a little over 13,000 visitors from Poland in 2015 which shows there is ample scope for growth in the sectorPoland’s population comprises around 38 million and it is the 69th largest country and ninth largest in Europe. Sri Lanka has identified Poland as one of the emerging markets in the East European region.“Scope for trade and investments with Poland, a vibrant economy backed by a strong currency and young population is enormous,” said NCCSL President Asela de Livera.Poland has a developed market and is a regional power in Central Europe, with the largest stock exchange in the East-Central European zone. It has the sixth largest economy by GDP in the European Union and the 10 largest in Europe.- LF "
